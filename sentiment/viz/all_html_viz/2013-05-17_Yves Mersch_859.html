    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)"> “Built to Last”: The New Euro Area Framework Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Barclays Research Conference,London, 17 May 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, The building we are in was bought by the Drapers’ Company from King Henry VIII in 1543.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">It has lived through turbulent times, from fires to conflicts - and, I should also say, various financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">But Drapers’ Hall has always recovered from the calamities it has faced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">It has been rebuilt, renovated, enlarged and embellished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Thus, it was built to last – but has changed over the centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Today, I’d like to speak about a quite different building: the “new euro area framework”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.53,0)">The euro area has been facing insufficiencies on several fronts, all at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.14,0)">Let me be blunt: it has had governance shortcomings, stretched states, fragile banks, shrinking economies, sinking confidence in institutions and doubts about its integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.44,0)">Each of these difficulties has exacerbated the others; it has been a vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.97,0)">The crisis did not originate in the euro area, nor is it limited to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.97,0)">But inside the euro area it has inflicted severe losses and pain, particularly on the younger generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Yet, in the euro area an unsuspected amount of repair is under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.24,0)">The threat of a break-up has vanished since last summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">A new political economy is within reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The foundations of a virtuous circle are already here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">My message today is that the euro area is being rebuilt to last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Its foundations are being strengthened and new pillars and floors are being added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The euro area will remain both viable and beneficial to its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the light of these testing circumstances, I would like to give some tentative answers – to four questions: Where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What are the strengths of the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.88,0)">What’s next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.33,0)">What remains to be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will then offer some final remarks, and answer your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.07,0)">Where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.43,0)">The European Central Bank has been in “crisis mode” for almost six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The challenges for us have escalated in various stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.33,0)">Allow me to recall them very briefly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.47,0)">The first stage was the financial turmoil that erupted in August 2007 when the US sub-prime mortgage crisis started to unravel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.13,0)">Globally, counterparty risks rose and confidence among market participants plummeted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.74,0)">This led to a drying-up of liquidity, and a sharp increase in risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.65,0)">The second stage of the crisis started in September 2008 after Lehman collapsed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.56,0)">Money markets froze, financial losses soared, bank deleveraging accelerated, and financial stress spilled over to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.87,0)">Trade and growth were hit hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.36,0)">The ensuing global financial crisis gave rise to the great recession, which affected European countries disproportionately due to their high degree of openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.07,0)">The even more serious third stage came in May 2010 when the euro area sovereign debt crisis erupted in Greece and spread to other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.26,0)">What happened?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.25,0)">After the launch of the euro, various cracks in the currency edifice emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.54,0)">Public finances were weak in several euro area countries; macro imbalances were persistent in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.27,0)">Some countries experienced a boom in housing and construction and productivity growth was slow in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.28,0)">The triggering event of the turmoil, on the other side of the Atlantic combined with the disappearance of “abundant money” exposed and deepened those fault lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">Several European economies became steadily weaker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.49,0)">The underlying reasons were several: there were shortcomings in governance  , flaws in the design of the euro area, misjudgements by regulators and supervisors, and also insufficient scrutiny by financial market participants as well as by credit rating agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.53,0)">They did not sufficiently differentiate between borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.23,0)">And I should not omit from this list the many economists who failed to see the systemic risks building up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.61,0)">The ensuing dysfunctional policy debate and the discordant national responses were also harmful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Understandably, national disaffection rose, as did scepticism about the euro area   - this is a phenomenon I know you are rather familiar with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.62,0)">Various doom-loops followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.77,0)">The fates of governments and banks became ever more intertwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.33,0)">Sovereigns had to recapitalise impaired domestic banks and support feeble domestic economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.98,0)">In doing so, they accumulated extra debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.61,0)">Perversely, even sound banks have been affected by the weakness of their home governments and domestic economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.31,0)">Then, lower credit ratings and higher interest spreads of both banks and sovereigns pulled each other further down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.95,0)">This hurt the real economy and started a vicious circle that has been very difficult to stop and reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.79,0)">Banks across the euro area are now deleveraging and recapitalising, and the flow of credit is still hampered in several countries, mainly those in which households and firms are also trying to deleverage, while budget consolidation is under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.02,0)">The functioning of the money market is severely impaired, credit is squeezed and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is clogged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.1,0)">The sovereign debt crisis came to a climax in mid-2012 when the risk of break-up seemed acute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.13,0)">Investors began shifting deposits away from banks in stressed jurisdictions, often to banks in countries where conditions were calmer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.22,0)">The deposit base fell in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.93,0)">Correspondingly loan growth deviated greatly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.02,0)">Small and medium-sized enterprises were, and still are, affected the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.47,0)">What has the ECB done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.65,0)">Over the last six years it has eased the credit squeeze, fought back against the economic slowdown, and countered financial fragmentation by slashing interest rates, flooding the banking sector with liquidity and lending widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It took large scale conventional monetary policy measures to prevent deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Its unconventional measures prevented a meltdown of the financial system and aimed to restore the impaired transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.07,0)">Yet, credit flows remain weak and growth is still anaemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.68,0)">To sum up where we stand: the sovereign debt crises of the euro area is a multi-layered affair: economic and financial imbalances plus failings of governance and flaws in institutional design, plus an erosion of trust and confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.6,0)">It’s an exceptionally complex situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Five euro area countries are now undertaking EU/IMF adjustment programmes, while a few others are addressing imbalances outside a programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What are the strengths?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Despite the depth of the crisis, the exceptional “flow and stock adjustments” under way, and ongoing financial market tensions, there are still some strong components supporting the building of the new euro area framework and holding things together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The first strength is the resilience of the single market, which has steadily transformed the now deeply interconnected euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Companies and banks have a European perspective and reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We are each other’s stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Economic integration is a diffuse process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It is the true engine of European integration and is generating largely benign effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The single market represents the intrinsic value of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is a common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It is an asset shared by all its citizens – a fact which is not given enough recognition as a stabiliser during these difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The second strength lies in the solidity of our financial infrastructures: they have withstood the full force of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer  , has enabled money market access throughout the crisis and for all countries: the cumulated imbalances are now steadily receding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">In 1998 there were 18 large-value payment systems: that number fell to six in 1999 and now there are two, which means that both efficiency and financial stability have been enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.81,0)">Central clearing counterparties   for securities and derivatives declined from 13 in 1999 to nine in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This entails greater efficiency gains by pooling activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And more is coming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.06,0)">In 2008, the Single Euro Payments Area started to take effect due to time-lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And the securities settlement systems will change radically once TARGET2-Securities becomes operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">This project is fully on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The third strength lies in the widespread acceptance of the need for adjustments and reforms in all dimensions of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The political authorities have taken action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">They are already overhauling the political economy of the euro area, and establishing new governance to restore fiscal sustainability and prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact has been tightened up by the so-called “six-pack” of economic governance measures, including the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure  , and they in turn have been complemented by the “two-pack”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Moreover, euro area countries are summoning up the courage to change – although it is painful in some regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">To quote Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union: “People will only accept changes under the pressure of necessity.” Indeed, change is under way in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">And the impressive political determination to reform together is not stopping at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Also a fourth strength is that as a result of the crisis, a “crisis management and resolution framework” has emerged at the European level– and it is working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">The initial stage was a fiscal backstop, the European Financial Stability Facility, and then the European Stability Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Confidence is slowly returning to both financial markets and high streets, even if growth and job prospects remain weak – the latter two being lagging indicators of the recovery under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">All this shows that European countries can turn themselves around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">To sum up the strengths: the “repair work” on the euro area foundations is under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Imbalances are slowly receding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Also there is the wide international circulation and relative strength of the euro as well as a stable demand for the euro as a reserve currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Yet, we are aware that deep reforms throughout the new framework are only as effective as they are completed, transposed, well explained, understood, adhered to, and given the time to display their effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We know that we are not completely out of the woods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)">So what’s next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">With the establishment of the ECB in June 1998 and the launch of the euro on 1 January 1999 monetary policy was centralised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Responsibility for the euro was entrusted to a strong and independent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The ECB has fulfilled its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Fiscal policy, economic policies and supervision, however, have remained at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">As this architecture has proved to be flawed, the respective Presidents of the European Council  , the European Commission  , the Eurogroup   and the ECB   drew up what is known as the “Four Presidents’ Report”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It advocates the completion of monetary union by way of an additional “four unions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These “four unions” are envisaged to mesh with each other, like cogwheels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.11,0)">The spin of one sets the others in motion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.39,0)">Conversely, when the momentum of one decreases the others follow suit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The banking union, the fiscal union, the economic union, and the political union   can transmit and reinforce the dynamics of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me elaborate on some key features of the banking union – a project with which I am closely associated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.57,0)">The fragmentation of the banking system along national lines has posed a direct threat to the integrity of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We need to break the doom-loop between sovereigns and banks, restore the confidence of depositors and investors – in fact rebuild trust in the whole financial system – as well as ease the reintegration of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The banking union will help to restore the proper transmission of monetary policy and relieve the ECB of some of the tasks undertaken during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Its importance and urgency cannot be overemphasised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The banking union comprises two main parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One is the Single Supervisory Mechanism  , which is scheduled to start operating at the ECB in Frankfurt, at the earliest 12 months after the adoption of the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The second part is the Single Resolution Mechanism  , which is a Siamese twin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.14,0)">The ECB cannot exercise this task as it will undertake the analytical part of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A separate authority is needed; perhaps one that is attached to the ESM, for the resolution task as it implies a distributional impact which belongs to the Executive prerogative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Still, close cooperation is warranted with the SSM and DG Competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What is also clear is that the resolution body needs to operate at the same level as the supervisor, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.95,0)">This becomes even more obvious amid the potential need to deal with cross-border operating banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The SSM will be a single supervisor for all banks established in the euro area, plus those banks established in the EU countries which have entered into a close cooperation with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">So it will have a truly European focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It should create a level playing field for the European banking industry and remove any national biases or supervisory forbearance, and prevent the hiding of bad assets – or even leniency – towards so-called “national champions”, a phenomenon that might have become more acute during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.03,0)">It is a myth that such champions were in the interests either of domestic economies or of national taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But the SSM will go well beyond that: it will result in the elimination of asset and liability matching on a national level that has done so much harm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How will the Single Supervisory Mechanism function in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There will be a two-tier system of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.81,0)">The banks considered to be systemically important, about 130 of them, will fall under the direct supervision of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">But all other banks, while remaining under national supervision, will not be excluded from the ECB’s supervisory reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.88,0)">In fact, national authorities will have to abide by ECB regulations, guidelines and general instructions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Hence, they will be subject to the ECB’s broad oversight mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Yet the boundaries between the two tiers can also be adjusted if the need arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">The ECB may decide at any time to exercise direct supervision over any other credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This will ensure the consistent application of supervisory standards as well as adherence to the guidelines and instructions issued by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB will be responsible for the functioning of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In practice, the ECB will rely heavily on existing national supervisors: their expertise and “proximity” to the supervised banks are essential for the SSM to be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.96,0)">No domestic aspect or concern must be overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Even in the case of the systemic banks that will be directly supervised by the ECB, national supervisors will still be involved in on-site inspections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In fact, there will be joint supervisory teams.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The assignment of supervisory responsibilities to central banks mirrors the prevailing consensus among experts and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">There are many synergies between monetary policy and banking supervision, and in our case there are benefits from sharing micro and macro-information on monetary policy, bank supervision, and the oversight of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Moreover, an important lesson from the crisis is that there can be no price stability without financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Most of the time, monetary policy and financial stability measures work in harmony.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">Still, there are concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">There are several things we need to do, notably, steer clear of the risks, as the ECB will be the prime liquidity provider for these banks; establish clear safeguards against any potential conflicts of interest between the various ECB functions as they could give rise to reputational risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">And at the same time we need to reduce costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.75,0)">The SSM also represents a huge logistical challenge for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We are working hard on this and are well aware that the rewards may be considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is requiring a lot of preparation at many levels including: selecting highly skilled staff – many experts are already coming from national supervisory bodies; drawing up the final list of systemically important banks that will be directly supervised; harmonising reporting requirements; working out procedures that will govern the SSM’s relationship with national supervisors; and preparing to review the quality of banks' assets, including legacy assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me add on the last point: Such a comprehensive assessment is needed before the SSM becomes operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This could be organised in a coordinated endeavour where the workload is shared between by the centre and the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Calling upon external experts, under the strict control of the SSM, will increase the credibility of the balance sheet exercise because of the impartiality of third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Moreover, their expertise in certain areas will add great value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The scope of their involvement might not extent the significant banks, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">First coordination has already started with the European Banking Authority   which in the past looked upon the resilience of banks under stress scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The SSM could undertake the asset quality review in the third quarter of this year until the first quarter of next year, and then in close cooperation with the EBA, conduct a stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This along with the balance sheet assessment will be a major component of the comprehensive assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The outcomes of the balance sheet assessment will also be an important input for the stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The combined results of both exercises could be published by mid-2014, just before the SSM is scheduled to become operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As always in life, there is no such thing as a free lunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">The question arises: who will pay for financial stability and, above all, who will pay in the event of a banking resolution?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.05,0)">There are two types of “costs”: operating costs incurred in normal times and losses sustained in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As for the operating costs, European supervision will be financed by fees to be levied on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">However, there will be efficiency gains from avoiding the duplication of services  , so additional cost burdens for the financial industry will be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.78,0)">What happens if a viable bank lacks capital?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Such a bank, wherever it is based in the euro area, should first try to raise fresh capital from its shareholders or in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">If it is unable to do so – for example due to unfavourable market conditions – fresh funding should be provided from a European recovery and resolution fund that is financed by all banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Such a fund should also help with resolution, for instance, to capitalise a bridge bank that is later sold on the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Bailing-in of stakeholders will also play an increasing role to cover the cost of resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.12,0)">During the crisis we have seen the full spectre from mainly bailing-out banks with taxpayers’ money and bailing-in even depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A reliable framework is needed to guide investors and savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore, the pecking order of a broad scope of bail-in instruments needs to be defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">The list of exclusion should be limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   currently being negotiated should clarify in particular the positioning of unsecured depositors in the cascade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">It is of crucial importance that an agreement on the BRRD is reached in a timely manner to have a resolution and recovery framework in place before the SSM starts operating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Only as a last resort should rescue funds be temporarily drawn from the ESM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">To ensure fiscal neutrality, a loan to the European recovery and resolution fund should then be repaid ex post via levies on viable banks, and of course, the proceeds from the re-privatisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.05,0)">Another rationale for the SRM as a separate entity is that a supervisor cannot give objective verdicts on the viability of banks if then these banks can only be closed in a disorderly way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.87,0)">That, in turn, could trigger contagion and endanger financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.76,0)">In other words, if banks cannot be resolved in a disciplined manner – known in advance and agreed upon – we could drift into supervisory forbearance, evergreening and zombification of companies as well as the banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Hence, a resolution mechanism is essential for repairing financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The capacity of the banking sector to absorb risks will increase, which is currently the bottleneck of loan provision to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">To sum up what’s next: the banking union consisting of the SSM and the SRM will contribute to financial soundness, stability and resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">All this would help to restore the proper transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.84,0)">The current very accommodative monetary policy stance could reach those it needs to reach unhampered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Correspondingly, the need for unconventional measures would diminish rather than increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.86,0)">A single supervisor without a resolution counterpart, however, would push the central bank into ever more risk-taking to ensure financial stability, thus even threatening the independence of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.33,0)">What remains to be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.47,0)">The crisis has been – and still is – a wake-up call for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.99,0)">Initially, some stressed countries were largely in denial about the need to tackle their imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.81,0)">Precious time was wasted, and that exacerbated the doom-loops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Then, things started turning around in mid-2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">A new political economy is within reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">But in the longer-term, what else do we need for the viability and prosperity of the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">We need to firm up the progress on the fiscal union, the political union and the economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Several elements of the fiscal union are ready.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I listed them a few minutes ago: they need to be transposed into national law, and adhered to at every level of government  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Concerning “genuine political union”, our institutions also need to adjust to the higher level of integration that constitutes the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">While on the intergovernmental EU wide level the Council has a counterpart on the euro area level, namely the euro group and the Euro Working Group, the executive arm of the supranational EU level, the Commission, and the legislator, the EU parliament, still lack an equivalent for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Yet, the principal building ground of the new euro area framework is the economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In the long term, we need euro area countries to become more flexible, open and to remain relatively synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This would increase shock absorption, improve resource allocation, remedy the current heterogeneities, harmonise the transmission of monetary policies, and boost growth potential, thus enhancing the resilience of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This implies a need for deep changes in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Allow me to point out that over the last few years the ECB has not only been a guardian of stability and among the most interested observers of the various deficit and imbalances procedures, but we have also raised awareness of the need for profound transformations in our political economy and in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We have been advocates of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In my view, this is our most important unconventional measure, but it will never be able to replace the self-responsibility of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In one respect, solving the sovereign debt crisis of the euro area remains a supremely national affair: namely, finding a consensus on, and domestic support for, new social contracts among all national constituencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The new political economy of the euro area and the “four unions”, i.e., what we are calling the new euro area framework, can provide a sheltered environment for reforms and sustainable domestic social contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">In most of the stressed euro area countries this still requires tough choices across the generations and over time: e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">education versus pension entitlements, infrastructure versus healthcare, research and development versus defence, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Strengthening of tax administrations and treasury systems, expenditure control, privatisation will also be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Reducing the costs of bureaucracy will matter more than ever across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">There are varying needs for true innovation clusters à-la-Silicon Valley, as well as investments in scientific and technical education, research and development, encouragement of “angel investments”, and grassroots and sustainable banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Labour markets need to become inclusive and fair in every country, while encouraging labour mobility, in particular in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Greater competitiveness and sustainable growth of the whole euro area will then follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">To sum up what still needs to be done: each euro area country needs to find its own trade-offs and support from its national constituencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There might not be a single approach fitting all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">No “pact” can force such transformation through, and no monetary policy measure – however unconventional – can replace it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.14,0)">Such “holistic” national therapies are inescapable: without them, no change in the euro area’s political economy and governance, or financing facility can be sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The tensions and inequalities are clear for everyone to see: we can no longer postpone what should already have been addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The new euro area framework is an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some final remarks All currency unions evolve in their early years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Their institutions adapt to changing circumstances, as we saw for example in the US, and several federal states in Europe and even in the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The idea of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union   has evolved over decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The euro area envisaged in the Werner Report of 1970 was ahead of its time, but planted important seeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty was a milestone and the most that Europe could have achieved 20-25 years ago, but that was not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.34,0)">There were various flaws in EMU’s design and governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In retrospect, systemic risks were partly endogenous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">We have learnt the hard way from our errors, and fortunately there are still a lot of strengths in Europe/euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The euro – and thus price stability and the future banking union – can provide a shield from outside shocks, secure the benefits of a credible world currency, and contribute to strengthening the single market and fostering internal stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This structure would have been unimaginable only five or six years ago: yet it might not suffice unless it is accompanied by national reforms and new social contracts that in some cases have been postponed for decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The new euro area framework is being rebuilt to be viable and to last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For a chronology of the crisis see also Drudi, Durre and Mongelli   “The interplay of economic reforms and monetary policy: the case of the euro area”, ECB Working Paper No.</span><span
