    <h2> Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Humboldt University, Berlin, 24 October 2011 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow: a vision for Europe Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Humboldt University, Berlin, 24 October 2011 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be invited to speak here at the Humboldt University this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One can only be honoured to be in the university of Hegel, Heinrich Heine and the Nobel prize-winning physicists Albert Einstein and Max Planck – not to mention 27 other laureates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But it is with the ideas of the university’s founder – Wilhelm von Humboldt – that I would like to begin my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a Frenchman who has lived in Germany for the past eight years, I note with interest that the mother of the university’s founder – Marie-Elisabeth Colomb – came from a French Huguenot family who also made that eastwards move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">Her family had emigrated to Berlin following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, a reminder that European integration is a process that has been with us for centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Wilhelm von Humboldt himself was deeply engaged with the question of how to create the conditions for individuals to flourish within a society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.75,0)">His answer involved removing the conditions for mutual harm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In some ways, this speaks to the challenges of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The individual Member States of the European Union   also seek to flourish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.71,0)">Their actions are interdependent and can both benefit and damage each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Removing the potential for mutual harm is essential for collective prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This dialectic between the individual and the community is at the core of the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.3,0)">It is the dialectic between the individual nation states and the community of nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And it presents some of Europe’s most fundamental challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">I would like to reflect today on how to address these challenges – to look forward and offer a perspective of where Europe could go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In particular, I would like to develop three propositions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">First, while the reasons for European unity have often been presented as deriving from past conflicts and past divisions, forward-looking motivations are in my view decisive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The unique construction of Europe – with strong local identities and large, integrated markets – is a source of great strength in the new, globalised world we face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">It allows Europeans to plant deep roots and build strong communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">At the same time, we can fully benefit from economies of scale and the free flow of trade and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">For this reason, European integration is profoundly in the interests of all Member States and deeply connected to their future prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Second, for Europe to realise fully its future potential, it needs the right rules and the right institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Europe requires a solid form of governance to ensure that the actions of individual countries are oriented towards the common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Our current arrangements have not yet fully met this standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">They are now being improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is a continuous process which will call for Treaty changes if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">As this process will take time, we need to start planning today for the Europe of tomorrow and the Europe of the day after tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Third, the underpinning of a more integrated Europe is the emergence of a true European public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">As one would say in German, die Schaffung einer europäischen Öffentlichkeit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Europeans today are highly interconnected via economic and social linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Yet our fragmented national public discourse does not necessarily permit citizens to understand fully these connections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">A true European public debate would help us deepen our interest in each other, bridge our linguistic differences and care more about what is happening across our borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These are the three main themes on which I will focus tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But before I talk about the Europe of the future, I would like to talk about the Europe of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To reflect on the relationship between member countries and Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">And to touch on the challenges we collectively face in tackling the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Europe and Germany Building deeper union between France and Germany in the service of Europe has been an important theme of my own working life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In this time, I have been profoundly influenced by the German commitment to a stability culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In the 1980s, I was seen in my own country as the strongest advocate of the ‘franc fort’ policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This policy was designed to be part of the modernisation of the French economy through a “competitive disinflation” policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In the 1990s, I worked side-by-side with Hans Tietmeyer and Horst Köhler to contribute to the foundations of the euro in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This work was to ensure that, among other things, the European Central Bank   would be based on the principles of independence and the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Then in 2003, I had the honour of moving to Frankfurt to become President of this institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">It was a great personal satisfaction to join an institution that embodied my deep-seated beliefs in central bank independence, price stability and economic discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Over this period I have developed a strong admiration for Germany and its people, and also for the way that Germany conducts its economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The German economy has often been thought of as the engine of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.6,0)">But less than 10 years ago, Germany was seen by some observers as the “sick man of Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Let me cite some books and newspaper articles from that time: “Can Germany be saved?”, asked one of this country’s most well-known economists in 2003, noting that “Germany provides something of a case study of what not to do in designing a prosperous future”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">“How the mighty are fallen”, said a major international magazine also in 2003, well representing the mainstream economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.88,0)">"After the German economy was seen as an exemplary model of successful capitalism for decades,” the magazine went on, “ today it is Germany that economists point to with a mixture of contempt and alarm.” “Vom Meister zum Mittelmaß”, wrote a major German newspaper in 2005, speaking of “absteigende Staaten wie Deutschland, die in ihrer Bedeutung schrumpften und ihren Haushalt nicht in den Griff bekämen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">” Thankfully, these gloomy forecasts proved mistaken, and today, Germany is in the lead in rebounding from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Since the trough of mid-2009, German real GDP has grown by 6.9% compared with the euro area as a whole by 3.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Employment in Germany has increased by 2.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Exports have grown by 25.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This performance is no accident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.29,0)">Neither is it based on cyclical, unsustainable factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It is the result of sound fiscal policies, permanent attention to unit labour costs, and bold reforms that have been rigorously implemented over a prolonged period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">And it sets an example that is very important for the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">First, it demonstrates how sound policies can lead to prosperity within economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">By encouraging industries to embrace the opportunities of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">By maintaining technological excellence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">By prioritising cost and price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">And by ensuring flexibility in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Second, it proves that it is possible to regain competitiveness within monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.78,0)">Germany after the post-unification boom had a very serious competitiveness problem itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It took a sustained effort to become competitive again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">This gives encouragement to euro area countries that have lost competitiveness and now must regain it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It also underscores the fact that the adjustment effort must begin immediately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But there is also a third lesson from the German example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Would the German recovery have been possible without the euro and Germany being in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Without Germany benefiting from a vast single market of the size of the United States with a highly stable currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The German recovery has taken place in the context of the best inflation record achieved by a major central bank for over 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The ECB has delivered an average rate of inflation of 2.0% since beginning operations in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.63,0)">In Germany it is even lower with an average yearly inflation rate of 1.57%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.4,0)">Such a low rate of inflation over a comparable time period is actually the lowest in Germany for over 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Moreover, expectations of future inflation remain firmly anchored in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Financial markets and euro area citizens expect the ECB to deliver on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The German public can rely on our steadfast commitment to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The euro has extended the zone of monetary stability to Germany’s main trading partners in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">As more than 40% of Germany’s exports go to other euro area countries, this is very important for German prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The stability of the euro has also helped German companies remain competitive vis-à-vis the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Europe and the crisis Let me now turn directly to our current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.45,0)">As you are all well aware, we continue to face the most serious economic and financial crisis since World War II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Tackling the crisis has required unprecedented action from public authorities to maintain economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.69,0)">Inevitably this has produced diverging views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is not surprising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro area is responding to events of historical importance and it naturally takes time to forge consensus on the right way ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But it is very important that people do not misconstrue these debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">They are about policies, not about principles, because in the euro area our principles do not change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Our principles are the foundations on which we rest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But our policies must adapt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">No two crises are the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is precisely because we want to defend and reinforce the principles we cherish, that we have to shape our policies appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.74,0)">I am fully aware that in this country people have genuine concerns about the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">They seek assurance that it remains a community of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That it is founded on rules and responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And that the rules are respected and the responsibilities are taken seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I would like to use this occasion to explain the way the Governing Council of the ECB is deciding on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our standard measure for fulfilling our mandate of maintaining price stability – avoiding both inflation and deflation – is interest rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But effective interest rate policy requires that our policy decisions are transmitted to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.43,0)">If that is not the case, our monetary policy cannot achieve its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this transmission, both banks and financial markets play an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They are crucial for the financing of the real economy – of firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.31,0)">Yet the crisis has damaged banks and at times severely disrupted the functioning of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Addressing these problems needed to be done through non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB has decided such measures, for monetary policy reasons, since the very start of the global crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It has been offering liquidity to financial institutions at a fixed rate and with full allotment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">It has also provided this liquidity over an extended period of time, up to 12 months, so that the euro area banking sector, Germany’s banks included, could continue to be as correct as possible a vehicle for the transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">With additional liquidity demanded by the euro area banks, our balance sheet has expanded during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But we have been prudent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our balance sheet has expanded by about 80% since the beginning of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Only for the sake of comparison the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve increased by about 230%, that of the Bank of England by 205%, and that of the Swiss National Bank by 235%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The crisis hit all of the economies concerned, but you can see that all our non-standard policies have been measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Of all our non-standard measures, the policy of full liquidity allotment at fixed rates has been the most important one in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Yet it is the bond market interventions that have received the greatest attention, and the most scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">But just as our measures of enhanced credit support have been necessary to ensure that banks continue to extend credit to the real economy, our bond market interventions have been necessary to help foster a more appropriate transmission of our policies to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The government bond markets are crucial for our monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.16,0)">They largely determine the prices of loans and mortgages and thus affect, indirectly, the transmission of monetary policy to all firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB’s government bond market interventions are not inflationary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Unlike the bond purchase programmes of other major central banks our aim is not to inject additional liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We actually absorb all liquidity injected by these purchases on a regular basis – euro for euro, week by week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">There is no fuelling of money growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">M3 growth is less than 3% currently and inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored by all standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So let me emphasise this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">It is very important to understand that all the ECB’s policy decisions during the crisis have been made fully in line with our mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">They have been taken in full independence and we have established a solid track record for our independent decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Both inflation and inflation expectations in the euro area demonstrate the value of independent deeds, not just words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.22,0)">Last week in Frankfurt, at the occasion of my official farewell as President of the ECB, Prime Minster Juncker, the longest-serving prime minister in Europe and chair of the Eurogroup, said that discussions of government pressure on the ECB lacked any basis in fact, that such pressure would have been completely futile and that the ECB always acts completely independently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Europe and the future I have talked about where Europe has come from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me turn now to where Europe is going.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.48,0)">When people seek a justification for European integration, there is a tendency to look backwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">European integration has banished the spectre of war from our continent, is always stressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">European integration has delivered the longest period of peace and prosperity in European history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This perspective is entirely correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.85,0)">But it is also incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">There are many more reasons for striving towards “ever closer union” in Europe today than there were in 1945.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And these are entirely forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">65 years ago the distribution of global GDP was such that Europe had only one role model for its single market: the United States of America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Today, Europe is faced with a new global economy, reconfigured by globalisation and by the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is a world where economies of scale and networks of innovation matter more than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">By 2016 – that is, very soon – we can expect the euro area in terms of purchasing power parity to be below the GDP of China and over and above the GDP of India.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Together, these two countries would represent around twice the GDP of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.17,0)">Over a longer horizon, the entire GDP of the G7 countries will be dwarfed by the rapid development of the systemic emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.18,0)">Europe has to cope with a new geo-political landscape very profoundly reshaped by these emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And Europe is also faced with new global challenges, such as climate change and migration, where effective solutions are possible only at the European and international levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In this new global constellation, European integration – both economic and political – is central to achieving prosperity and influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For an outward-looking, export-oriented country like Germany, this is profoundly in its interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The challenge is to set the correct path for European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Getting this right is essential to realise fully our continent’s tremendous potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me therefore lay out a vision for the Europe of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The Europe of tomorrow The creation of Europe’s economic and monetary union is unique in the history of sovereign states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The euro area constitutes a “society of states” of a completely new type.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Like individuals in a society, euro area countries are both independent and interdependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">They can affect each other both positively and negatively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Good governance requires that both individual Member States and the institutions of the EU fulfil their responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First and foremost, every country in the euro area needs to keep its own house in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This means responsible economic policies on behalf of governments and rigorous mutual surveillance of those policies by the Commission and Member States – going beyond the indispensable surveillance of fiscal policies to encompass all aspects of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">In a society, the institutions of law enforcement can ultimately compel a citizen to abide by the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the euro area, our framework based on surveillance and sanctions depends on the willingness of offending states to comply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.06,0)">I am aware that many observers wonder what can be done if a Member State simply cannot deliver on its promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">That is why, when I had the deep honour of receiving the Karlspreis, I suggested a new approach to the policing of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">For countries that lose market access, the current approach of providing aid against strong conditionality is justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Countries deserve an opportunity to put the situation right themselves and to restore stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">But as I suggested in Aachen, this approach should have clearly defined limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.84,0)">A second stage should be envisaged for a country that persistently fails to meet its programme targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Under this second stage, euro area authorities would gain a much deeper and more authoritative role in the formulation of that country’s economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.24,0)">This would move us away from the present concept where all decisions remain in the hands of the country concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Instead, it would be not only possible, but in some cases compulsory, for the European authorities to take direct decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.28,0)">Implementing this idea of the second stage would evidently require a Treaty change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It would also imply a new concept of sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This is necessary given the complex interdependence that exists between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And it is ultimately in the interests of all citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In my view, it was important to launch such reflections as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">I am very happy that the European Council, at its meeting yesterday in Brussels, has indicated in its conclusions: “The European Council notes the intention of the Heads of State or Government of the euro area to reflect on further strengthening of economic convergence within the euro area, on improving fiscal discipline and deepening economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty changes.” The Europe of the day after tomorrow Let me now look even further into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">A vision that can stabilise expectations needs to address not just tomorrow, but also the day after tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And as it takes time to implement such a vision, we must start thinking about it today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is my firm conviction that the Europe of the day after tomorrow will be of an original type – a new type of institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In Aachen, on a personal basis, I began to reflect on some elements of this new possible framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">I asked the question: with a single market, a single currency and a single central bank, would it be too bold to envisage a ministry of finance of the Union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This European finance ministry would, first, oversee the surveillance of both fiscal policies and competitiveness policies, and when necessary, have responsibility for imposing the “second stage” I just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Second, the ministry would perform the typical responsibilities of the executive branches regarding the supervision and regulation of the EU financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And third, the ministry would represent the euro area in international financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Since my Karlspreis address, it seems to me that the case for such an approach has strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I now hear leaders calling for a Treaty change to create stronger economic governance at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I hear euro area citizens calling for better supervision of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And I know that our partners in the G20 look to Europe as a whole for solutions, not to individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Increasingly, it seems that it is not too bold to consider a European finance ministry, but rather too bold not to consider creating such an institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This finance ministry would be only one element of the European future institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Exactly how these new institutions would eventually evolve one cannot say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">As Jean Monnet once wrote: « Personne ne peut encore dire aujourd’hui la forme qu’aura l’Europe que nous vivrons demain, car le changement qui naîtra du changement est imprévisible ».</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We have several federal or confederal institutional frameworks in today’s world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.33,0)">To name only a few, the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Swiss Confederation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The European Union is unique in its past history, in its present nature, in its future ambition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.34,0)">It will have to invent its own concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But one could imagine that in the future European institutional framework, the Council might evolve into the Senate of the Union, the European Parliament into the lower house, the Commission into the executive and the European Court of Justice into the judiciary – each time for the part of sovereignty that is shared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">And I have no doubt, taking into account the long and proud history of the European countries, that “subsidiarity” will play a major role in the future Europe – very significantly more than in the present models of federation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.43,0)">As I said, these are personal remarks of a European citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The future of Europe is in the hands of its democracies, in the hands of the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Our fellow citizens will decide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They are the masters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In any case, whatever the future institutions of Europe will be, an essential element would be the emergence of a truly pan European public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As Europeans we connect deeply with our nations, traditions and histories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These are Europe’s roots.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">But we also need to extend our branches more widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To do this, the Euro area needs media, in the broadest sense of that word, that allow citizens to take a deeper interest in each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Media that provide regular information on events beyond national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Media that permit citizens to debate and exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And media that are not constrained by language barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">All we need is a pan European public debate, a gemeinsamer öffentlicher Raum, a débat publique pan-Européen that allows Europeans to appreciate the wider community of which they are part – a community where their interests are increasingly shared and their lives more interdependent than ever before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">*** Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">Twenty years ago, in 1991, my friend Hans Tietmeyer, the former President of the Bundesbank, said that “monetary union is not just a technical matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">It is in itself, to some extent, a political union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">This condition creates mutual responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We see that a challenge in one country can become a challenge for the euro area as a whole.</span><span

rgb(255,129.47,0)">The global crisis has called into question the overall economic and financial strategy of major advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.45,0)">All have weaknesses in their economic systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.92,0)">Not surprisingly, the main weakness for Europe was the nature of its institutional framework – in particular, that its economic and fiscal governance was not commensurate with the interconnectedness of economies sharing a single market and a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The question is how to confront those obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.46,0)">We should not look back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We must look forward – to the opportunities of Europe for our collective betterment; and to the potential for every country to be stronger and more prosperous in a well-functioning union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">As far as the ECB is concerned, its Governing Council will continue to anchor solidly price stability and confidence in Europe – stability and confidence for 17 countries and 332 million fellow citizens who have decided to unite closely with a single market and a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As Konrad Adenauer said in Aachen 57 years ago: “Gerade wird man die Mahnung verstehen, dass Europa uns heute Schicksalsgemeinschaft ist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Dieses Schicksal zu gestalten ist uns übergeben”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">“Above all, people will understand the call: that Europe, for us today, is a community with a common destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It’s up to us to shape that destiny”.</span>
