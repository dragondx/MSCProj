    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> Speech at the Bank of Korea on Regional co-operation: experiences in East Asia and Europe by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Seoul, 1 July 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Introduction It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">At the outset, I would like to thank Governor Park  , Deputy Governor Lee and the Bank of Korea staff, in the headquarters and the Frankfurt Representative Office, for the excellent organisation of my visit to Korea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In my remarks today, I would like to share with you some thoughts on recent developments in East Asian regional co-operation against the background of my own experience with the European regional integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, I would like to begin with the main motivation behind my remarks of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Second, I will briefly touch upon the respective merits of regionalism and globalisation, stressing that the two approaches are not alternatives, but can be combined for the benefit of both those countries involved and third countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In this context, I will discuss the potential impact of regional integration, both in terms of trade creation and as a way of enhancing competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Third, I will discuss what is known as "the endogeneity argument", according to which there is a relationship over time between the depth of trade and financial interdependence achieved and the closeness of co-operative arrangements developed by the countries concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As developments on the real and institutional sides become mutually reinforcing, this creates momentum towards further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Fourth, and connected with the endogeneity argument, I would also like to briefly review some conditions for sustained integration, focusing on sound institutional and legal underpinnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Finally, before I conclude, I will reflect upon the need to address monetary and exchange rate co-operation at some stage in a regional integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Motivation The 1997/98 Asian financial crisis marked an important turning point for the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">On the one hand, it was a traumatic experience that exposed some structural weaknesses of the "growth miracle", on the other hand, it brought about heightened awareness of the risks of contagion and the need for policy co-operation in the region, especially on financial issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Greater awareness proved instrumental in driving the common goal of strengthened regional co-operation much higher on the East Asian countries' policy agendas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Korea, alongside China, Japan and the ASEAN countries, the so-called "ASEAN + 3" grouping, have played a central role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Within a short period of time in the aftermath of the crisis, major concrete co-operative steps have been taken, which include the Chiang Mai Initiative   and the Asian Bond Fund  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">A common goal is to help economies in the region to better deal with potential adverse shocks and attendant spillover effects, either through a network of currency swaps or by strengthening the regional financial market foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Meanwhile, the ASEAN + 3 has also agreed to work on closer economic partnership and to help lay the foundation of an East Asia Trade Area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thus, in my following remarks, for simplicity, I will use the term "Asia" when in fact referring to the ASEAN + For somebody like me, who has been involved in the European integration process for most of his professional life, this renewed interest in regionalism in Asia makes the attraction of drawing some sort of parallel with the European experience almost irresistible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Of course, I am well aware of the many major differences between the two experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.83,0)">Let me mention only two of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">First, after more than 50 years of sustained initiatives and convergence, the 15 Member States of the European Union   have completed a single market with a single currency adopted by all but three members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">By contrast in Asia, trade and financial integration, despite recent progress, remains at a relatively early stage of development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Second, when the process started in Europe, the countries involved were rather homogeneous with broadly similar per capita income levels and industrial developments, which is still deemed to be an important factor in facilitating regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Given the larger differences in income levels and economic and financial structures across Asia, the process can reasonably be expected to be more protracted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">However, a counter-argument in favour of integration among heterogeneous countries is that it can bring significant benefits to the less-developed partners, as we have started to experience with the accession of ten new member countries to the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">With these caveats in mind, there are still some dimensions of the European experience that might be of some policy relevance and value to other countries in the world pursuing regional integration, including Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.97,0)">Regionalism and globalisation One major concern often heard about a potential trend towards regionalism is its supposedly negative implications for global welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As Bhagwati succinctly put it, the important question is whether trade blocs serve as "building blocks" or "stumbling blocks" for worldwide trade liberalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It is generally agreed that regional integration is beneficial to the parties involved as economic factors are more efficiently allocated through increased competition and specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.3,0)">However, depending on its specific economic and institutional parameters, a more integrated region may also imply discrimination against the "outsiders".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In my view, provided the regional agreements are fully compliant with the open economy principles fostered and monitored by institutions such as the WTO and the IMF at the global level, the higher economic efficiency resulting from regional integration should also benefit the rest of the world through lower trading costs, trade-creating rather than trade-diverting flows and enhanced global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Changes in trade patterns recorded in the European Union over time seem to support the view that regional integration does not necessarily mean trading less with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One needs only to examine two simple measures of intra-regional trade  : as a share of both total trade of the region and total GDP of the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">While the former indicator shows the importance of trade links within the region, the latter - by using the complement to intra-regional trade, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">extra-EU trade - captures the degree of trade openness of the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Back in 1980, intra-EU trade as a percentage of total EU trade was already high, at around 58%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">When the integration process was gathering further pace during the 1980s and 1990s, intra-EU trade rose steadily to a peak of 65% of total EU trade in 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.43,0)">Since then, the ratio has gradually fallen, dropping to below 60% last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.36,0)">Over the same period, the degree of trade openness first declined from around 24% in 1980 to just above 20% in 1992, and then increased again to reach 29% in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Since the share of intra-area trade in total trade was similar in 2002 as compared to 1980, this implies that extra-EU trade also increased as a percentage of total GDP of the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Considering that the single European market was completed in 1992, these changes suggest that trade in a largely integrated region does not necessarily result in ever growing intra-area trade at the expense of openness vis-à-vis third countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Indeed, the EU experience over the last two decades shows that the reverse may be true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">On a more analytical level, both regional integration and globalisation entail the opening-up of domestic markets to cross-border trade and financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In economics textbooks, we have all learned that an economy will become more efficient under increasing competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In this context, regional integration may be seen as a second-best policy choice, since there are more potential competitors in the global economy than in a region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">However, the gravity model of trade integration suggests that geographic, institutional and cultural proximity matters for cross-borders flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.89,0)">This model implies that the intensity of competition may be inversely proportional to distance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">And one may infer from this tentative proposition that opening up economies in a regional context may result in more intense external competition than trade and financial liberalisation erga omnes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.79,0)">From this perspective, it seems difficult to claim that regional co-operation is less favourable than global integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Endogeneity of regional integration Apart from the exogenous factors I have just mentioned, arguments relating to the endogenous nature of regional integration also need to be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Such endogeneity relates to the fact that, over time, the degree of trade and financial interdependence and the corresponding level of co-operative arrangements are likely to be mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Certainly, co-operation arrangements are based on pre-existing economic interdependence; but it is also true that they foster a furthering of interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For example, if countries in a region mostly engage in intra-industry trade specialisation or are initially susceptible to common demand shocks, then business cycles are likely to become more similar across the countries concerned, as trade increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In other words, closer trade ties within a region over time may be expected to result in more synchronised business cycles within the region, which in turn would make trade, economic and financial co-operation more desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">This endogeneity argument appears to be relevant to Asia, in particular given the region's high dependency on IT exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Cyclical developments in global IT demand are likely to influence domestic business conditions in the region in a rather symmetrical manner, which in turn would call for improved regional co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This endogeneity argument also extends to the link between institution building and economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In the EU, institutional progress beyond the creation of a customs union towards a single market and an economic and monetary union was associated with a deepening of economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In parallel, increasing economic integration validated and supported the process of institutional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">From 1968 to 1992 when the EU progressed from a free trade area to becoming a single market, the number of binding legal acts across policy areas adopted by the European Community increased substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">In the first half of the 1970s, the Community adopted more than 2,600 acts, and the number rose steadily over the next two decades, to around 12,500 acts in 1991–1995.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">For this reason, institution building appears to be one of the prerequisites for sustained regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Institutional underpinnings for integration Admittedly, there are many prerequisites for sustained regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, allow me to focus on EU institutional and legal underpinnings in three main areas: trade and the EU single market, financial market regulation and supervision, and macroeconomic policy surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In reviewing them, I will try to identify issues of specific relevance to Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.77,0)">Trade and the EU single market Obstfeld and Rogoff have argued that market segmentation caused by microeconomic factors such as trade frictions and costs, as well as nominal price rigidities can help explain the so-called exchange-rate disconnect puzzle, i.e., "why are exchange rates so volatile and so apparently disconnected from fundamentals?".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">One policy implication of this argument is that greater integration at the micro level could help reduce exchange rate volatility among the countries involved, while in turn making these countries more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In line with the endogeneity argument discussed above, the countries concerned would then have a strong incentive to stabilise their exchange rates through strengthened co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The European experience suggests that to successfully remove these microeconomic obstacles to integration is a very difficult task and requires strong institutional and legal underpinnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.35,0)">If one takes trade integration as an example, while it may be relatively straightforward to develop a free trade area by removing all internal tariffs, doing away with more opaque "non-tariff" or "regulatory" barriers to trade is a considerably more complex and difficult task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.28,0)">Unlike customs duties, microeconomic regulations cannot simply be dismantled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In practice, the smoothing of technical obstacles to trade requires the harmonisation of a vast array of differing national regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In Europe, only with the "single market programme" from the mid-1980s onwards did the European Community make significant headway in easing market segmentation at the microeconomic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This was more than ten years after the removal of all customs duties and quantitative trade restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Arguably, the success of the single market programme rested on the combination of a number of elements of the Community's institutional and legal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Against this background, a policy question relevant to future regional integration in Asia is whether, at some point, a stronger institutional and legal framework would be needed alongside further trade integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Financial market regulation and supervision The European approach to financial market regulation combines the harmonisation of essential rules with the application of the principle of mutual recognition of national regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">This approach ensures region-wide financial stability, while allowing financial service-providers who meet the requirements of their domestic legislators to be free to provide services to consumers throughout the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A first step in the harmonisation of essential rules has often consisted in the incorporation into Community law of the standards and codes set by international bodies, such as the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, harmonisation has invariably extended well beyond the observance of international standards and codes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">At present no fewer than 26 Community legal acts are in force to regulate the activities of banking and securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These Directives cover a broad variety of aspects of financial market regulation, ranging from minimum capital requirements and accounting and transparency standards to deposit guarantee schemes and rules concerning the sharing of responsibilities for supervising multinational institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The principle of mutual recognition, which is applied to financial market regulation, also extends to the prudential supervision of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Given the need for Asian countries to continue to develop their regulatory and supervisory frameworks, a relevant policy question that may arise in the light of the European experience is whether Asian countries should continue to pursue national approaches, or whether it might be preferable to develop a harmonised framework at the regional level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A regional approach to financial market regulation and supervision may be preferable given the integrated nature of financial markets and the risk of financial market contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It could facilitate financial market consolidation and provide efficiency gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">At least for some of the smaller Asian economies, the development of a single financial market infrastructure may be the only way to benefit fully from sound, diverse and liquid financial systems capable of securing and maintaining the confidence of international investors and thus supporting financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Macroeconomic surveillance For co-operative arrangements to be sustainable, mutual surveillance and peer pressure have an important role to play in the macroeconomic field, once a certain degree of economic integration has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Also in this area, institution building and rule-based policy frameworks have proved instrumental in the EU experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I will spare you a detailed analysis of institutional arrangements like the European Monetary System, the Maastricht convergence criteria or the Stability and Growth Pact, which have all been essential in furthering or maintaining macroeconomic convergence in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Allow me only to try and identify a few basic principles that may be distilled from the EU experience in the area of regional macroeconomic surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First, there is a need to pool required information and statistical data on the basis of mutually agreed technical specifications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Second, in order to facilitate exchanges of views and common assessments, the countries concerned must agree on common benchmarks against which to assess national performances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the EU experience, the Maastricht criteria played this role in the second stage of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.32,0)">Third, peer pressure is not likely to be very effective in a purely intergovernmental setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the EU context, this difficulty was addressed by creating supranational institutions, like the Commission and later the European Central Bank, endowed with sovereign competencies within well-defined remits and subject to clear transparency and accountability obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.68,0)">Compared with trade integration and harmonisation of financial regulation and supervision, macroeconomic surveillance is probably the area where institution building may turn out to be the most difficult in the context of regional co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The EU experience supports this view, since the introduction of the single currency was designed as the final step following on from trade, economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">From this perspective, one may argue that it would be premature for Asian countries to take steps towards further macroeconomic surveillance, in view of their current level of regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.83,0)">I would tend to disagree with this view, since the EU experience shows that long lead times are needed for institutional arrangements to have an impact on a regional co-operation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.09,0)">To take only one example, the Committee of Governors of the EU central banks, which was the forerunner of both the European Monetary Institute and the ECB, was created in 1964.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This was 15 years before the setting-up of the EMS/ERM, which marked the first significant step in monetary and exchange co-operation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this connection, I am not sure that it was appropriate to rule out the project of an Asian Monetary Fund, put forward in the aftermath of the 1997/98 Asian crisis, as being premature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Monetary and exchange rate co-operation Exchange rate stabilisation has long been at the heart of Europe's integration effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.13,0)">The lack of progress in trade integration in Europe during the years after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system is to be largely seen as the result of a failure to maintain exchange rate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Then, following the establishment of the European Monetary System in 1979, exchange rates once again became more stable, and this period of sustained monetary and exchange rate co-operation significantly coincided with further trade integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.39,0)">The history of Asian countries is very different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, while European currencies delinked from the dollar, most Asian currencies, with the Japanese yen being the notable exception, continued to peg their exchange rates to the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">This common peg to the dollar provided an informal common monetary standard that contributed to macroeconomic stability in the region but also proved, at some point, unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Since the demise of this common standard in most Asian countries in 1997/98, there has been a wide range of proposals on possible exchange rate and monetary co-operation, including the adoption of a common currency or a peg to a common basket of currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Although I do not intend to enter this debate, I would like to emphasise that it would be difficult to make further progress towards regional economic and financial integration without having to address, at some point in time, the issue of the "monetary dimension" of such co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">From the perspective of policy-makers, exchange rate stability should support an open trade policy and avoid trade-distorting developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">At the same time, by promoting a more efficient allocation of resources, both trade integration and exchange rate stability are likely to support output growth, which should, in turn, facilitate the opening-up of markets and the maintenance of a stable exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In this context, if Asia does seek to proceed further with economic and financial integration, it seems likely that increasing attention will need to be paid to fostering exchange rate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Progress in either of these areas is likely to be more difficult without steps also being taken to strengthen the "monetary dimension" of regional co-operation in Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Conclusions Ladies and gentlemen, The development of the European Union is generally regarded as one of the most advanced regional integration processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.27,0)">In many ways, for example in the initial conditions and country characteristics, it is unique, and, as such, does not, and cannot, offer a blueprint for regional integration in other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Nevertheless, the EU is based on core elements that are fundamental to all efforts to deepen regional integration, and identifying these is both insightful and useful for drawing possible lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">For one, regional integration is not only good for the parties involved, but it is also likely to be beneficial to the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Second, the importance of institution building in the European Union in supporting the integration process cannot be overemphasised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Third, the EU experience shows that macroeconomic regional surveillance, preferably through formalised mutual surveillance mechanisms, enhances regional peer pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Such a framework is also likely to facilitate the dissemination of best practices in other policy areas  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Given the degree of regional integration already achieved, I believe that Asian regionalism will prove to be a sustainable process and, like the rest of the world, we look forward to a greater global role for Asia in the future.</span>
