    <h1> The ECB and the Federal Reserve - an ocean apart? </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Harvard University, 12 October 2016 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.05,0)"> The ECB and the Federal Reserve – an ocean apart?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.26,0)">Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Harvard University, 12 October 2016 Interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic seem to be trapped near zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.48,0)">At first glance, looking only at the short term policy rates, one might think that both the Federal Reserve   and European Central Bank   are facing very similar circumstances and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Below the surface, however, the differences are pronounced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In the euro area monetary policy continues to be highly accommodative, aiming to steer inflation back to levels in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the US, which is at a different stage of the business cycle, interest rate normalisation has so far been slower than expected It is worth taking a closer look at the details to understand the unprecedented actions of central bank on either sides of the ocean in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.19,0)">To do so, it is useful to divide the crisis into three separate phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.11,0)">The first phase was the global financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers just over eight years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.3,0)">Central banks worldwide faced a largely common challenge to avert a collapse in aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.56,0)">The second phase centred on sovereign debt, a problem which only affected the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.03,0)">In the third phase, which is still in place today, stubbornly low global inflation and anaemic growth are compounding domestic challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first phase: combating a systemic shock The first phase of the crisis had its origin in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.23,0)">In 2006, many experts considered the subprime crisis to be a minor incident with only local impact, but then it escalated into a financial crisis of systemic proportions that propagated to the whole advanced world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.98,0)">Many banks experienced a sudden stop in their access to money markets, and the ensuing liquidity squeeze in interbank markets affected credit provision across the United States and euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.88,0)">The effects on the real economy were immediate and large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.32,0)">Both regions went through severe recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">But the respective central banks and fiscal authorities responded promptly and decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.83,0)">The Federal Reserve quickly cut its target for the fed funds rate to close to zero, then embarked on a series of large-scale asset purchases of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.43,0)">Likewise, the ECB cut its main refinancing rate by more than 300 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">To ease the liquidity constraints of the banking system we altered the mode and maturity of our operations and widened the range of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">These responses were, in many ways, an extension of the existing operational frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">The asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet traditionally consisted mainly of holdings of US government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">By contrast, the ECB, lacking a single fiscal counterpart, injected liquidity mainly through repos with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This mode of operation reflected in turn the predominance of bank-based intermediation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Coupled with a sizeable fiscal impulse, both types of actions were successful in delivering the stimulus needed to counteract the shortfall in aggregate demand, stabilise output and initiate the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.5,0)">Unemployment in both jurisdictions, which had spiked in the early phase of the crisis, levelled off and began to decrease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.31,0)">At this point, however, the euro area entered the second phase of the crisis, causing its growth trajectory to diverge substantially from that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.8,0)">It experienced a sovereign debt crisis in 2011-12 which was unique among advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.09,0)">Fears about the sustainability of the sovereign debt of some euro area Member States triggered a sharp widening of sovereign spreads and introduced the fear of redenomination risk: that some countries would revert to national currencies, invariably weaker ones, and thus leave the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.03,0)">Moreover, banks in some countries came under intense scrutiny over their domestic sovereign holdings and some national banking systems completely lost access to wholesale funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.11,0)">Private investment contracted as the cost of capital rose and uncertainty spiked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The fiscal stance in the euro area shifted from expansionary to contractionary as governments acted to restore market confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.17,0)">The euro area entered a renewed recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The second phase: unique institutional challenges The ECB responded to the sovereign debt crisis with various new monetary policy measures, such as our long-term lending operations, and even began purchasing sovereign bonds under the Securities Markets Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">All these measures aimed to support bank funding markets and ensure that the flow and pricing of credit to the real economy was in accordance with our intended monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But a question often asked is why we did not resort to large-scale asset purchases at this point, as the Fed was already doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Bear in mind that inflation developments in the euro area at the time did not suggest a tight stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Headline inflation was rising steeply from its 2009 trough, exceeding 3% in October 2011, partly driven by an increase in underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Inflation expectations were well anchored around our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.46,0)">Hence our diagnosis of the problem in this period focused more on monetary transmission than on the policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Our stance was not being transmitted evenly across all parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And so our measures in this period were specifically designed to remove those impairments in transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.5,0)">The main issue we faced was the perverse interaction between the euro area banking sector and institutional incompleteness of our monetary union, which had fundamental implications for our policy in a system of bank-based monetary transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.58,0)">While the first phase of the crisis can be interpreted as a severe recession amenable to monetary policy, this second phase was the consequence of institutional challenges that monetary policy could only aim to mitigate, but could not overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.5,0)">Despite swift efforts to set up a European Banking Union there were in fact three major differences between the euro area and US in terms of the environment facing monetary policy: the sluggish recovery of the banking sector, the fragmented fiscal framework of the euro area and the structural rigidity present in many euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.99,0)">The necessary process of banking sector repair proceeded much more slowly in the euro area than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Indeed, here in the US it was more or less completed by end-2011, but in some euro area countries it is still ongoing, even today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.38,0)">US authorities exerted pressure on banks   to recapitalise with public money, via the Troubled Asset Relief Program.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In the euro area, there was a preference for recapitalisation through organic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Recapitalisation in the United States was bolstered by the early and effective use of stress tests in the US to restore confidence in solvent banks, reinforced by a credible backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.52,0)">By contrast, early attempts at stress tests in the euro area were hampered by splits among national supervisors and, with only national backstops available, the tests proved unsuccessful at restoring confidence in the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">US banks were also encouraged to recognise non-performing loans   more quickly, freeing up capital for new lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The third difference was the ability to efficiently resolve insolvent banks and prevent the emergence of “zombie lenders”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The US had a trusted process through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, backed by a credit line from the US Treasury.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.73,0)">By contrast, prior to the crisis many member states of the euro area did not even have a national resolution framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.04,0)">Since 2008, the FDIC has resolved over 500, mostly smaller banks in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.6,0)">While determining the exact definition is tricky in the euro area, the number appears less than a hundred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">All this explains why the recovery of the banking sector took longer in the euro area, which our monetary policy had to work to mitigate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.13,0)">And what is more, when public authorities in the euro area did intervene to backstop their national banking sectors, the fiscal implications naturally differed: the onus fell entirely on national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.39,0)">This in turn contributed to the second area where the euro area and the US diverged: the emergence of the so-called “vicious loop” between banks and sovereigns, which further delayed the financial repair process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.52,0)">Importantly, this vicious loop not only further impaired monetary transmission, but it also had implications for the stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.36,0)">The need for accelerated fiscal consolidation to quell the sovereign debt crisis constrained the ability of fiscal to carry out macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area and hence the overall policy-mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.5,0)">Whereas the US could consolidate its budget against the backdrop of a firming recovery, some euro area governments were forced into a pro-cyclical fiscal stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">That in turn worsened the macroeconomic environment in which monetary policy had to operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Institutions are again central to explaining the difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.71,0)">While the US operates in a consolidated union – with a federal Treasury acting as the counterpart of the central bank – the euro area comprises 19 sovereign governments with separate national budget constraints, making sovereigns more vulnerable to a loss of market confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">This is particularly valid amid a no-bail-out clause for member states without any debt-restructuring mechanism below the federal level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Accordingly, national fiscal policies have to be sound ex ante to build fiscal buffers, as is the case for states in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.71,0)">Yet fiscal rules were only weakly enforced before the crisis, permitting public debt levels at the national level that were too high for a monetary union that is not complemented by a fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.35,0)">That said, even countries with low starting debt levels – such as Ireland and Spain – ended up embroiled in the bank-sovereign loop, showing that the institutional framework was incomplete in other ways, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.35,0)">In terms of sovereign risk, there was no fiscal backstop of sufficient capacity for sovereigns until the European Stability Mechanism was established in late 2011, leaving the euro area vulnerable to contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.51,0)">Likewise, there remains no mechanism for sovereign debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.86,0)">And in terms of bank risk, there was no backstop on the European level as one might expect for a European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.86,0)">Still, it would be too simple to lay the challenges faced by monetary policy solely on the European supranational institutional framework; national characteristics were in many ways inadequate too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Indeed, the third major difference between the US and the euro area can be found in the structural flexibility of their respective economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.48,0)">Many euro area economies entered the crisis with long-standing structural rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In a more flexible economy, output tends to be less affected by shocks as relative prices adjust more quickly, and the recovery in output is faster since the economy can reallocate resources in a more efficient way Unemployment has decreased more slowly in the euro area than in the US, not only due to a weaker demand environment, but also because of labour market rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.95,0)">Indeed, every time since the 1970s that there has been a downturn in economic activity, unemployment in the US has quickly readjusted when the economy picked up, while in euro area it has taken much longer to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.06,0)">And once the unemployment rate starts falling it rarely returns to the previous low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The result is that euro area unemployment has risen steadily for 40 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">So in sum, in this second phase of the crisis, monetary policy in the euro area, which works primarily through banks, had to contend with a protracted process of banking sector repair, exacerbated by a sovereign debt crisis and a lack of fiscal space, and compounded by sub-optimal institutions to tackle structural issues and support the transmission process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The measures we adopted were specifically aimed at addressing the impairments of the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our two 3-year lending operations, in particular, were effective in securing term funding for banking systems cut off from wholesale markets, and initially had a strong easing effect on sovereign spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Our interventions in sovereign bond markets under the Securities Markets Programme have also been found to have reduced yields and volatility in the countries targeted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And when redenomination risks spiked, the Outright Monetary Transactions announcements were extremely successful in removing unwarranted fears about a break-up of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Importantly for the credibility of the ECB, the legality of OMTs was confirmed on the highest judicial level by the European Court of Justice and also by national constitutional courts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Fortunately, around the same time as these measures were introduced, euro area leaders called on the Presidents of major European Institutions to develop a roadmap towards deepening Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This has led to a marked improvement in the institutional environment, which has contributed both to an improved transmission of our policy and to a stronger recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In 2014, the Single Supervisory Mechanism was launched under the aegis of the ECB, which directly supervises the 129 significant banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In contrast to the earlier attempts to build confidence in the euro area banking sector, its founding act was to carry out a thorough and credible asset quality review and stress test of bank’s balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The result has been an improved acknowledgment and provisioning for NPLs, while bank capitalisation has also increased – the banks participating in the Comprehensive Assessment had built up additional capital of over €200 billion between the onset of the crisis and the Assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In terms of repairing the banking sector, the new Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive provides a harmonised EU framework for resolution with a requirement of bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">And the new Single Resolution Mechanism ensures that decisions on resolution are made consistently across the euro area, with resolution financing given at the union level and then recouped from the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">This is a vital step to make resolution more effective, while it should also go some way towards severing the link between banks and their sovereigns by shifting the financial burden onto the private sector, or in the interim, onto the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.81,0)">But there is more still to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.93,0)">For the bank-sovereign nexus to be truly broken it is clear that Banking Union needs to be completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">That means moving towards genuine risk-sharing over deposit guarantee schemes, coupled with genuine risk reduction on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">European institutions need to be strengthened in other areas, too, notably those governing fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">To my mind this must entail moving from a framework of decentralised rules to more effective central institutions; it hardly helps credibility when we take years drafting new rules only to break them at the first test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And there is still an urgent need for more structural reforms – because third phase of the crisis has been, above all, structural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The third phase: the re-emergence of structural challenges This third phase – which we are still in today – has been characterised by two main challenges: low inflation and low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.79,0)">Just as in the initial phase of the crisis, these are common challenges for advanced economy central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">But what has become increasingly clear is that the challenges today have a much stronger structural element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.71,0)">Low global inflation is partly a cyclical phenomenon – linked to falling energy prices and the slowdown in major emerging market economies – but it is also a result of structural changes brought about by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">And the secular slowdown of global growth has brought with it declining long-term interest rates across the advanced world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To be sure, the intensity of these challenges has varied across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The euro area, still recovering from its double dip recession, has faced a more prolonged period of low core and headline inflation, which the ECB has reacted to by launching three new unconventional tools: a set of targeted long-term refinancing operations with in-built incentives for banks to lend, a negative interest rate policy, and an asset purchase programme encompassing public and private sector securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">These measures aim both to smooth transmission and to expand the policy stance to combat excessive disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And they have been effective in easing financial conditions and supporting the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.62,0)">Yet it is clear that, for all central banks, the structural backdrop has made monetary policy normalisation slower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">Consider lower growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.96,0)">It is now clear that the long-run growth potential of major economies has been falling for a number of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">For example, the Consensus forecasts for long-run growth real GDP for the US – that is the average growth six to ten years – stood at 3.1% in early 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.85,0)">The latest figure is just 2.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.6,0)">Long-run growth forecasts for the euro area were revised down from 2.2% to 1.4% over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.9,0)">These lower forecasts represent in part the impact of ageing populations, but also reflect the falling trend in total factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.59,0)">This affects monetary policy because slower growth in potential output reduces what is often referred to as the equilibrium interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">While not directly observable in the real world, this widely used concept is organised around the notion of an equilibrium level of the rate of interest where there is neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.75,0)">If the equilibrium rate falls, the margin above the effective lower bound becomes compressed, reducing the space in which central banks can operate to provide accommodative policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.21,0)">One might reasonably ask why central banks did not identify this trend sooner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.28,0)">The answer seems to lie in an overreliance on pro-cyclical estimates of potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.7,0)">Indeed, the revisions to estimates of potential growth have mostly occurred after the crisis, whereas it is most likely that the slowdown in productivity had already started before the crisis but was masked by the credit-fuelled boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.79,0)">For example, in 2007 the euro area’s output gap was estimated by international institutions such as the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission to be negative – somewhere between -0.2% and -0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.31,0)">The most recent estimates put the output gap in the region of positive 2.7% to 3.4%, a significant downward revision to views of potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.11,0)">At the same time as potential growth has been declining, the share of global factors driving inflation seems also to have been increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.18,0)">In large part, the common global trend can be explained by the decline in price of energy and other commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.27,0)">But low global inflation goes beyond weakness in domestic demand and falling energy and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In recent years there has been a growing understanding of the role of global demand factors on domestic inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.26,0)">For example, it has been observed that changes in the degree of slack in OECD economies are having a smaller impact on inflationary pressures than it has in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In part this changing correlation is a result of the success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">But structural factors are also playing a role: higher import volumes as a result of advanced globalisation have increased the importance of international prices relative to domestic prices, forcing domestic mark-ups to be less sensitive to the state of the domestic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">This may imply that monetary policy has to react more aggressively to counteract shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.28,0)">So in combination, central banks may be facing a two-pronged challenge to their mandates: a situation where, due to the role of global inflation, more stimulus is needed than in the past to deliver their domestic mandates; and where, due to the falling equilibrium interest rates, their ability to deliver that stimulus is more constrained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">That would certainly offer one explanation for why monetary policy has needed to stay accommodative for so long across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.74,0)">This does not make monetary policy ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As we have seen in the euro area, even with a low equilibrium rate central banks can still steer conditions in the wider economy by targeting directly the constellation of interest rates that matter for borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.08,0)">But one nonetheless cannot deny that the fall in the equilibrium rate poses a challenge for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This challenge for monetary policy has been recognised, with a number of innovative solutions proposed by academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.64,0)">Let me mention two but also say upfront that I am not particularly convinced by any of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.17,0)">One option that has been mooted is to allow nominal interest rates to go deeper into negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.06,0)">Yet there is an effective limit to lowering rates since ultimately this conflicts with the ability of citizens to hold cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.62,0)">Therefore some scholars have called for the imposition of electronic money and the abolition of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.07,0)">As I have discussed at length elsewhere, I see serious problems with such an approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.08,0)">It risks gambling with central banks’ credibility at a time when credibility is paramount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.25,0)">And perhaps even more importantly, it denies the crucial social function of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Another option proposed by some observers is for central banks to raise their inflation objectives and therefore to lift equilibrium nominal rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Leaving aside the debate about the costs of higher inflation, I am not sure that this idea is entirely convincing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The reason is that the mechanism through which it works is the signalling channel – people expect higher inflation, so inflation rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.59,0)">But at a time when inflation is low everywhere, and when central banks are running very accommodative monetary policies just to achieve that, one can question whether such signals would really be credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.96,0)">I see a risk, in fact, that changing our strategy to rely on fuzzy concepts and unobservables would only end up damaging our credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">So what we need today, in my view, is to shift the debate away from its narrow focus on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Rather than concocting more and more innovative solutions for central banks to get around the lower bound, we should focus instead on what other policy areas can contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.11,0)">In a world of very low interest rates, monetary policy cannot be the only game in town – and we should not pretend it can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In particular, we urgently need to press ahead with structural reforms to improve long-run economic growth, which will consequently lift equilibrium interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In my view it is much better to provide monetary policy with greater room with a process that increases output and wealth than by ones that increase social costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">At the same time, fiscal policy needs to become more effective at complementing monetary policy in managing cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In the current euro area context that means those countries with fiscal space should use it better, and going forward fiscal rules should be more rigorously enforced so that countries enter downturns with greater ability to carry out active stabilisation and invest into education and innovation, to name but a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For individual jurisdictions the exact policy mix will of course differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In some cases the emphasis may be on increasing public investment, in others on more growth-friendly tax policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Likewise structural reforms that aim at raising productivity have to be tailored towards domestic priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">But given the common nature of the challenges for central banks, all countries would benefit from prioritising it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And the positive spill-overs will clearly be larger if all act in unison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.28,0)">Conclusion Roughly eight years of extremely accommodative monetary policies on both sides of the Atlantic might lead to the notion that the ECB and Fed have been confronted with similar or even homogenous challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.93,0)">This would be a misapprehension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Major institutional and structural differences at the onset of the financial crisis explain why the clean-up efforts in the US were faster and more effective and the recovery was more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">After the institutional short-comings of Monetary Union had been painfully exposed, much progress has been achieved on the road to completion and further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, this institutional reform package took time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Now, economic recovery, although still timid, is under way in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">But this finding cannot be taken as an excuse to rest on our laurels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">More determined structural reforms need to be implemented to lift the growth potential and overcome the ultra-low interest rate phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">A more determined approach to tackle the problem of non-performing loans is necessary to tackle the remaining legacy of banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">When the macroeconomic ship is engulfed by a major storm, all hands – not just monetary policy – need to man the pumps.</span><span style="background-color:
