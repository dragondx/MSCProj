    <span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)"> The reform of financial regulation: priorities from an ECB perspective Dinner speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Association for Financial Markets in Europe  , Paris, 6 March 2012 Introduction   Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to be with you here in my new capacity as a Board member of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">In my remarks today I wish to focus on some regulatory initiatives which I regard as being instrumental to a stable, well-functioning financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">At the peak of the financial crisis, the Group of Twenty   committed to an unprecedented overhaul of the financial regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As you may know, it assigned the Financial Stability Board   a central role in developing and overseeing the concrete regulatory initiatives as well as monitoring their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, international coordination is vital when dealing today’s complex and integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Three and a half years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, I can safely say that much has been done to improve the resilience of the financial system, drawing on the lessons learned during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.94,0)">Still, the overhaul of the regulatory and supervisory landscape is not complete: several pieces of the puzzle still have to be fitted in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of the various areas that have been addressed by the FSB, I would like to focus today on three main issues that I deem of special importance from the ECB’s perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">First, I will discuss the timely and consistent implementation of the new Basel III framework, both at international and EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Second, I will consider the ongoing work to address the “too big to fail” problem, particularly within the specific EU landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, I will address some key policy issues in the field of OTC derivatives, financial markets infrastructures and the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, taking into account their importance for the orderly working of financial market activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Timely and consistent implementation of Basel III The new Basel III rules form the cornerstone of the new prudential regime for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In view of the G20’s commitment, a timely and consistent cross-country implementation of the Basel standards as well as the subsequent enforcement of the new rules are clearly high-priority issues which will pose significant challenges for the authorities and the banking industry alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">I very much welcome in this regard the Basel Committee’s decision to assess the implementation of Basel III in parallel across major jurisdictions, namely the EU, the US and Japan this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This effort is instrumental for promoting an international level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the EU, as we all know, the EU Commission published last year its proposal for a Capital Requirements Directive and the Capital Requirements Regulation, which together constitute the “CRD IV”, the purpose of which is to implement Basel III in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB, in accordance with its statutory task, provided its Opinion  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Let me first and foremost stress that we acknowledge the leading role of the Commission and welcome its commitment to a consistent transposition of the new capital and liquidity rules into European law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">One very important topic is the introduction of a single rulebook in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We consider such a rulebook as an important step towards establishing a single market for financial services and enhancing financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">One of the benefits of this rulebook would be a commonly agreed definition of regulatory capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The consistent application of such a definition would make it easier to compare eligible capital instruments from bank to bank within the EU, thereby strengthening the confidence of market participants in the loss-absorbing capacity of banks’ capital and, more generally, in the resilience of the EU’s financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The ECB proposes in its Opinion the possibility for national authorities, within the framework of a single EU rulebook, to adopt – with specific safeguards – stricter requirements in their respective Member States for macro-prudential reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is necessary because Member States need to address country-specific financial stability concerns stemming from different structural features of their domestic financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is key that the possibility for Member States to apply these stricter requirements should be framed within the single EU rulebook framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">To this end, specific safeguards should be put in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, definitions should remain intact; only quantitative ratios and limits can be tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Second, the European Systemic Risk Board could play a coordinating role in assessing financial stability concerns and possible unintended consequences and spillovers to other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Furthermore, the European Banking Agency   and the ESRB should publish regular updates on their websites of measures adopted by Member States and the underlying reasons for stricter requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Third, where financial stability concerns that triggered the application of more stringent measures cease to exist, the quantitative ratios and limits should return to a harmonised level set by the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Towards a pan-European approach to the resolution of systemic financial institutions The FSB has adopted a dual approach to deal with the so-called systemically important financial institutions  , namely by targeting both tighter loss absorbency requirements as well as improving the resolution technology available to authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">A milestone in this area is the international framework for global systemically important banks agreed by the FSB and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The framework proposes a progressive capital surcharge, depending on a bank’s systemic importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This surcharge system is necessary to provide banks with correct incentives to decrease over time their own systemic footprint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.93,0)">Even more crucial, and much less advanced, is the resolution approach to the “too big to fail” problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.08,0)">During the financial crisis, the failure of a large cross-border banking group was not a credible option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.21,0)">As a result, governments had to resort to massive taxpayer-sponsored bailouts, in some cases even the ring-fencing of banks’ assets within national jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.41,0)">This was a clear sign of the lack of adequate resolution powers, which would have minimised disruption to the financial system as well as the burden on public budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.09,0)">This shortcoming was realised both globally and in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Last November in Cannes, the G20 endorsed the FSB’s new international standards called “Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">On the basis of this document, the European Commission is about to finalise its legislative proposals for an EU framework for bank recovery and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The consistent implementation of these Key Attributes at international level is clearly a priority for the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">How will all this work in practice for large cross-border banks in the EU’s Single Market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The Commission’s proposals – which I fully support – will provide a common language for domestic authorities for recovery and resolution planning, set up a common toolbox of supervisory and resolution measures, and also establish some principles for cross-border cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">All this already looks like a huge step forward from the status quo, where national regimes are lacking the necessary resolution powers, and not harmonised with each other, either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, we should not forget that in the Single Market major banks operate in more than a dozen countries via branches and subsidiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.9,0)">When Fortis was broken up in 2008, only three countries were involved directly in its crisis management, but cooperation still proved to be difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">That is why I strongly believe that the EU needs to make progress towards a truly integrated resolution regime that adequately mirrors the cross-border nature of its banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">First, let me mention that bank levies have been already imposed in several EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Although they are undeniably a burden on the financial sector, I believe collecting ex ante funds for resolution is ultimately beneficial for all parties, if the financial system becomes safer in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">But having purely national financing arrangements would again present the practical and political challenges of coordination and eventually sharing burdens among several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A superior option would be to collect levies directly at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Should this prove politically unfeasible, we would still at least need to have rules on how the national financing arrangements should together contribute to the overall resolution costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Pooling resources in a single pan-EU resolution fund would bring a number of positive elements into the resolution framework of cross-border banking crises: it would reduce the amount that would be subject to burden-sharing; it would increase risk diversification and additionally provide the right incentives for cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">In any case, precise and transparent procedures and balanced decision-making mechanisms relating to the activation and use of the funds will be necessary to make it acceptable for Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Second, I also think that a pan-European financing arrangement is the pre-condition for an even more ambitious step forward, namely the establishment of a single European resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.16,0)">Why would we need such a body?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We have already learnt from past experience that crisis management and resolution calls for incredibly quick decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This typically means taking over a bank on a weekend and opening it for customers on the Monday, for example in the form of a bridge bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Considering all the legal and technical complexities of such a move in a cross-border context, the only efficient way to do this is to have a single authority taking the lead and relying on national resolution authorities as its agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Certainly, a lot needs to be done to set up an integrated European resolution regime like this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">But it is not something for the distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Recent events have underscored the need to be more ambitious – now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.58,0)">During the recent financial and sovereign crisis in Europe, we have seen the pernicious interaction between weaknesses in the financial sector and fiscal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Many policy initiatives have been put in place to restore confidence in European banks, despite concerns over their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.36,0)">Low short-term interest rates in the euro area should in the short term help to prevent a disorderly adjustment of balance sheets and support the profitability of financial institutions, but they may weaken the incentives for repairing balance sheets in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">A pan-European financing arrangement would be one of the most effective measures to break the link between the creditworthiness of banks and that of their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Its establishment would also remove the need for ad hoc policy measures in response to crises, such as the one-off EU-wide capital exercise conducted by the EBA, which incorporated market valuations of sovereign exposures in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">I am also convinced that such an integrated resolution framework is likely to be the most suitable for the industry as well, since it ensures a level playing field and that the relevant rules are consistent throughout the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">OTC derivatives, market infrastructures, and the MiFID review Let me now briefly comment on something that could be considered the “plumbing” of the financial markets: namely, over-the-counter   derivatives and market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The reform of OTC derivatives markets has been a key part of the work to enhance the financial system’s resilience since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.1,0)">Indeed, the limited development of financial market infrastructures, weaknesses in bilateral risk management and the lack of transparency regarding counterparty exposures in OTC derivatives markets contributed to the financial market turbulence, as the cases of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG have painfully demonstrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.17,0)">These cases also illustrated the potential systemic repercussions of malfunctioning OTC derivatives markets, particularly in view of their large size and close linkages with the underlying cash markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">To enhance the functioning of OTC derivatives markets, the G20 agreed that standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through central counterparties by the end of 2012; in addition, OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I see two particular priorities at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">First, I have the impression that international discussions in recent months have focused heavily on the implementation of the mandatory clearing obligation and paid much less attention to objectives in the fields of standardisation and trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We should not forget that standardisation is a pre-condition for centralised clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Second, as the EU and the US are moving to finalise the technical details of their new legislative requirements for OTC derivatives, I believe that further efforts are necessary to ensure consistent requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">To this end, it will be essential that both the final EU and US rules converge to fully reflect the substance of the updated principles for financial market infrastructures, which the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions will release next month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me briefly touch on the further development of financial market infrastructures for OTC derivatives, focusing on the role of central clearing counterparties   and trade repositories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The rationale for fostering the use of CCPs is that a CCP reduces systemic risk by acting as counterparty to every trade, applying multilateral netting, and particularly stringent risk management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this way, potential contagion risks in the case of a default of a CCP clearing member are minimised both for the CCP itself and for the financial system more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">On the other hand, trade repositories play a critical role in providing centralised data record services for OTC derivatives transactions regardless of their degree of standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This enables a comprehensive overview of open positions and the corresponding exposures arising from OTC derivatives transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">There is a longer-term trend towards global and offshore financial market infrastructures which is linked to the economies of scale inherent in network industries and intensified by the introduction of mandatory clearing for OTC derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As a consequence, we are seeing a growing concentration of systemic risks in a limited number of global CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.64,0)">Such risks have not yet been adequately addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.98,0)">In particular, cross-border oversight arrangements often do not exist or are insufficiently developed, which implies that foreign authorities do not have the appropriate information to assess possible risks to their jurisdictions and/or to take action to reduce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Furthermore, procedures and loss-sharing in the case of the default or resolution of global/offshore CCPs have not yet been developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Let me also mention that, in parallel, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering the potential adoption of location policies for CCPs predominantly using a non-domestic currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I would like reaffirm that as a rule, the core infrastructures for the euro should be located in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">When they are not located in the euro area, they should comply with the CPSS-IOSCO principles, and also with central bank-relevant policies so as to preserve the integrity of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moreover, they should be subject to effective oversight by euro area authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.99,0)">There can and should be no automatic granting of liquidity to offshore CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me finally say a word on the revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive – the MiFID review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The ECB fully supports the European Commission’s proposals, which mark an important step towards strengthening investor protection and creating a sounder and safer financial system in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The EU regulatory framework needed a revamp to adequately take into account financial innovation and the latest technological developments, and to address the G20 commitments to tackle the less regulated and more opaque parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">With regard to the specific measures that are being proposed, let me mention a number of key issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">First, the ECB welcomes the upgrade to the market structure framework, which will extend the scope to a new trading platform, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">the organised trading facility  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Second, the ECB also fully supports the proposed extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements beyond equity instruments, to include structured products and derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">When properly calibrated, such measures would enhance price formation and support the evaluation of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Third, the proposals to increase data consolidation are also crucial, both for investors and the authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">They would ensure efficient comparison of prices and trades across venues and facilitate the monitoring of market abuse by the supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Finally, as regards the proposals to tackle the development of new trading strategies, such as algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, the ECB supports these amendments insofar as they would enhance the efficient functioning and integrity of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Conclusion In my comments tonight, I have attempted to give a brief overview of some of the themes which I consider important for the creation of a stronger and more resilient financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">International coordination has reached unprecedented levels thanks to the distinguished role played by the G20 and the FSB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">European integration has made giant leaps since the Lamfalussy report of 2001 and the De Larosière report of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.21,0)">But this is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The euro area is an Economic and Monetary Union, an “E-M-U”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">European governments have strengthened the governance framework through the Six-Pack and the Fiscal Compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Their actions to address fiscal and economic imbalances are bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">They should further enhance their efforts to boost the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">So the “E” stands for “Economic”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The ECB has used conventional and non-conventional measures to support price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is striving to restore the transmission channels of monetary policy and make sure that the impulse stemming from it is transmitted uniformly across the 17 economies of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">So the “M” stands for “Monetary”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But the letter “F” – for financial – is missing: to operate smoothly and to be more resilient to crises, the Economic and Monetary Union has to become a true financial union.</span>
