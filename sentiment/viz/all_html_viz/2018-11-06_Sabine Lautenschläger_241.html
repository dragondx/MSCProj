    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> Good governance and the role of supervisory boards Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Luncheon of Chairs of Supervisory Boards of banks in Germany, Frankfurt, 6 November 2018 What must a bank be able to do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.1,0)">As always, the answer depends on whom you ask.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Bankers or bank shareholders are likely to say that a bank must be able to make a profit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But as a supervisor I would tell you that a bank must be able to manage its risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.66,0)">These answers do not contradict each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.57,0)">A bank that can’t make a profit will fail, as will a bank that does not properly manage its risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So the real question is what each of us should focus on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.93,0)">What’s the focus of supervisory boards?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.24,0)">What do you yourselves focus on?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.16,0)">In a sense, you are caught between two stools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the one hand, you are bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">On the other hand, you are also supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Supervisory boards play a major role in managing risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They contribute to the checks and balances that every bank needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They are a core element of good governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">And we have high expectations of you and of what you can do to make your bank more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We expect supervisory boards to assess and oversee the work of management bodies – independently and thoroughly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Most of all, they have to ensure that strategic decisions are always based on a sound analysis of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this regard, you serve as the management’s good conscience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.63,0)">In a nutshell, this is what supervisory boards should do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Whether they really do it, whether they are able to do it, depends on many things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.06,0)">It depends on individuals and it depends on structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Those who chair a board, who are members of board committees or who interact with internal control functions need to be available and possess the right knowledge and experience, not only to meet today’s needs but also tomorrow’s challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In our view, supervisory boards still have some room to improve, particularly with regard to their collective knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.22,0)">Assessing and overseeing management bodies requires ever more technical knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Just think of digitalisation and IT, of internal models or new rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">While no one expects every individual board member to be an expert in all of these areas, the collective knowledge of the board needs to be well-balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And it’s not just the quality of board members, it’s also the number of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.08,0)">If too many people are around the table, it’s hard to have sensible debates and take sound decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.48,0)">In this case, too many cooks can indeed spoil the broth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">This is particularly relevant in times of crisis when there is little time to take decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.8,0)">And we still see boards with too many members – also here in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And it’s also about how the board is integrated into the bank, with independence being the keyword.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The European Banking Authority, the EBA, has issued very clear guidelines requiring supervisory boards to have a sufficient number of independent members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">I fully support this very important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Only those who are truly independent can challenge and influence the decisions taken by management bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.89,0)">Among other things, the EBA requires that board members have no material financial or business relationships with the institution itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">Likewise, members should neither be a controlling shareholder of the institution nor represent the interest of a controlling shareholder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So, it’s about formal independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">All in all, European banks have seen an increase in the number of formally independent board members over the past few years, even though some banks lag behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.27,0)">In Germany in particular, supervisory boards and shareholders are prone to doubts and misunderstanding in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.72,0)">What do supervisors really expect as regards independence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">We know that, unlike in many other countries, there is no legal duty in Germany to have independent board members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.17,0)">And that is a pity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So we cannot enforce anything in that regard, but we can still express our expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">We expect supervisory boards to have a “sufficient” number of independent members because that is part of good governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What is deemed “sufficient” depends on the individual case, of course, and it follows the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">German banks would in any case not violate the law if their supervisory boards had more independent members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Banks and shareholders would even benefit from stronger checks and balances, more diversity and new perspectives, which would help to counter the risk of groupthink.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But it’s not just about formal independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Board members also need to be independent thinkers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Only then can they form their own opinions and exert their own judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Even though boards must take decisions as one and stand for them as one, each member must be able to defend their own view in discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The supervisory board is a core element of good governance and risk-oriented management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But it’s not the only element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The frame that a bank builds around the risks it takes – the risk appetite framework – is equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">The risk appetite framework comprises the principles, processes, internal controls and systems, as well as the responsibilities and the limits of material risks that the bank wants to take on or has already taken on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And, of course, the supervisory board plays an important role in building a sensible risk appetite framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Over the past few years, banks have made good progress in designing their risk appetite frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Still, there is scope for improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.45,0)">Even though risk appetite frameworks now cover many more types of risk, one category is often overlooked: non-financial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.18,0)">Reputational risks, IT risks or legal risks are often either not covered at all or just in part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.63,0)">I know that it’s difficult to measure these risks, but neglecting them is no solution either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Once the risk appetite has been defined, risk limits play a major role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">They ensure that the risks taken are in line with the risks defined; they make the risk appetite operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">It is important that banks break down these limits by business lines, entities or countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.1,0)">Not all banks do that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.26,0)">And when they do, the local limits are not always consistent with those at the consolidated level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is something banks need to work on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.23,0)">Another problem is that banks often set the limits so high that they are no of help in steering risk taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.7,0)">It is obvious that this puts the entire risk appetite framework in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Building a sensible risk-appetite framework is not that easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And it’s not enough to just build one; it also has to be applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That’s the crucial point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Banks must turn the risk appetite framework into a key element of their risk culture and their decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.44,0)">What does that mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It means that all parts of risk management must be precisely aligned to each other – including the risk appetite frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And they must be aligned to the rest of the organisation as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">What good is a well-defined risk appetite if the remuneration schemes set different incentives?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What good is a well-defined risk appetite if it’s not finely-tuned to the business model or the business strategy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.31,0)">In our view, too many banks still see their risk appetite framework as a separate tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">It is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It must become an integral part of decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Most banks do not use the defined risk appetite to facilitate discussions at all levels of the organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">This, too, they must change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">These are a few of my thoughts on the topic of governance and the role of supervisory boards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Now I am looking forward to having a discussion with you.</span>
