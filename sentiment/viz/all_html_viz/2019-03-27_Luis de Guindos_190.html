    <span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)"> International spillovers of monetary policy and financial stability concerns Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at The ECB and Its Watchers XX conference, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2019 Introduction It is a great pleasure for me to speak at this year’s ECB Watchers Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Given the topic of this session, I will start by referring to our recent findings on international spillovers of monetary policy and the related financial stability concerns for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will then focus on our financial stability assessment at the present juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In doing so, I will briefly refer to an analytical tool we have employed to monitor and assess the banking system’s resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Globalisation has not only caused inflation and output to become increasingly synchronised across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Equity prices and financing conditions have become more synchronised, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">Most of this synchronisation stems from   global shocks, but the effects of international spillovers of monetary policy are less obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">In my talk today, I will touch upon issues surrounding these international spillovers, and whether they are of concern for the financial stability of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.21,0)">In a globalised and financially integrated world, spillovers from the monetary policy of one country to other economies are unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We can identify at least three international transmission channels: The “aggregate demand” channel, through which monetary policy affects domestic demand and, thus, the demand for foreign goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The “exchange rate competitiveness” channel, through which monetary policy affects the exchange rate, meaning it changes the price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The “financial channel”, through which monetary policy affects domestic financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">When there are strong financial connections between countries, these conditions may change abroad as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">From these transmission channels, let me focus on the “financial channel” for the remainder of my talk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.26,0)">Financial spillovers from US monetary policy to the euro area Measuring international spillovers is not easy, because global shocks lead to economies moving in a synchronised manner for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In line with previous evidence , recent ECB research identifies large financial spillovers from US monetary policy to global financial conditions, including euro area financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">More specifically, over the course of one month, monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve System drives up euro area corporate bond spreads  just as much as US corporate bond spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.22,0)">It also triggers declines in euro area stock markets of a similar magnitude to the declines in US stock markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">However, the financial spillovers from ECB monetary policy to US bond spreads, or to foreign equity markets, are found to be less impactful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This asymmetry in the international impact of US monetary policy and euro area monetary policy is rooted in the dominant role of the US dollar in global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Furthermore, our analysis  shows that there are only limited spillovers from the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve to euro area inflation and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This suggests that ECB monetary policy actions are, by and large, able to shield the euro area economy from spillovers from US monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">But undoubtedly, there is evidence that US monetary policy is a driver of a “global financial cycle”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In step with such a financial cycle the risks to euro area financial stability can change as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Current financial stability concerns in the euro area As you know, our characterisation of the main risks to euro area financial stability has remained broadly unchanged over the recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.75,0)">We see four main risks: The most prominent risk stems from the possibility of a disorderly increase of global risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.45,0)">The second risk is related to renewed debt sustainability concerns, for sovereign debt in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.93,0)">The third risk is that banks’ intermediation capacity may be hampered by their continued low profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.83,0)">Finally, we are of the opinion that possible liquidity strains in the investment fund sector constitute a growing risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">All four risks are intertwined and would have, if they were to materialise, the potential to be mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In 2018, a growing economy and improved banking sector resilience were important positive factors supporting financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.66,0)">Now, however, the assessment is affected by a weakening economic growth outlook for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">In the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections, expected real GDP growth was revised downwards, and the outlook continues to be viewed as tilted to the downside on account of persistent uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.52,0)">In my view, the deterioration in the growth outlook increases the risk of financial instability particularly via two main channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.6,0)">First, low economic growth raises concerns about sovereign debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.38,0)">And second, it further dampens profitability prospects for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.67,0)">A weaker growth trajectory will challenge euro area sovereigns’ ongoing deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.52,0)">Low growth and elevated public sector debt also leave a number of euro area countries vulnerable to higher funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Furthermore, threats stemming from rising protectionism around the globe, and high political uncertainty within Europe, may amplify potential corrections of sovereign bond risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These risks notwithstanding, market-based indicators of stress in the euro area sovereign bond markets have remained relatively contained in 2019, and debt sustainability concerns have remained country-specific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Looking ahead, as growth prospects moderate it is imperative that fiscal buffers are rebuilt in countries where government debt still is too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.48,0)">A prolonged period of low economic growth also poses challenges for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.18,0)">Over the past ten years following the great financial crisis, funding strains and subsequently hampered bank intermediation capacity related to low bank profitability have figured prominently in our risk assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.0,0)">The low growth and inflation environment will probably exert downward pressure on the risk-free rate component of bonds across maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.69,0)">As a result, profitability stemming from the maturity transformation business may come under renewed pressure – not least as retail household deposits tend to be bound at zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.28,0)">Furthermore, should downside risks to the economic outlook materialise, higher loan loss provisions may further compress bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Accommodative monetary policy has greatly supported bank profitability in past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In fact, conventional and unconventional measures have improved the quality of credit overall, thereby reducing provisioning needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Our measures have also increased the demand for loans, which has more than offset the negative effect of compressed margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.89,0)">Furthermore, structural factors are also weighing heavily on euro area banks’ profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In an environment where cyclical factors may exert further downward pressure on bank profitability, banks would need to step up their efforts to overcome structural challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Such measures may include cost reductions – including lower staffing costs and streamlining of branch networks, enhanced digitalisation – implying initial, one-off large-scale investments, revenue diversification and the reduction of the stock of non-performing loans in the six countries where levels are still high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">A number of regulatory and policy measures could help to improve the institutional setting in which the banking sector operates and facilitate banks’ efforts to adjust their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Such measures should include completing the banking union  , the subsequent removal of the remaining non-harmonised national options and discretions, and making progress with the capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This could foster further consolidation, including across borders, and address the problem of overcapacity in the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Assessing the financial stability of the euro area Beyond regular monitoring activities, financial stability analysis entails assessing the impact on the financial system of risks materialising, including risks related to international spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Such assessments can also help inform the calibration of possible appropriate macroprudential policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The stress-testing framework is an important analytical tool to quantitatively assess financial system vulnerabilities and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Stress testing exercises of the banking sector assess the sector’s resilience and how it performs under adverse circumstances, thus providing a measure of the severity of these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Individual bank results provide further information about banks’ potential capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.08,0)">Stress tests can therefore show how the financial system will react when risks, such as those relating to spillovers, materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In order to enhance its stress-testing capacity, the ECB has invested in an analytical framework that not only tracks the resilience of the banking sector but also accounts for how it interacts with and feeds back in to the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This framework complements the EU-wide stress tests conducted under the aegis of the European Banking Authority  , which are predominantly microprudential in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.43,0)">Our so-called macroprudential stress testing loosens the assumption that banks’ balance sheets are constant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.39,0)">As banks are hit by, say, negative   effects from the global environment, they may react by deleveraging their loan books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">This type of stress testing also accounts for what implications banks’ reactions would have for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.54,0)">In other words, macroprudential stress tests consider the adverse credit supply shock that may lead to an amplification of the macroeconomic effects of the global shock, which, in turn, could further damage banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">By modelling the negative feedback loop between the banking sector and the real economy beyond the first round of shocks, we believe the exercise becomes more realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">A macroprudential stress test of banks directly supervised by the ECB, using the baseline and adverse scenarios of the recent EBA stress test, confirmed the general resilience of the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.02,0)">Results, however, point to an additional fall in GDP of 1.6% across the euro area, on top of the GDP shocks of the adverse scenario over the three-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This stress-testing framework can also inform the calibration of macroprudential policies with the aim of limiting unintended spillovers to other parts of the financial system or the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the spirit of pre-emptive macroprudential policy, these exercises can emphasise the need for the timely build-up of capital buffers, which can then be used to absorb losses when risks materialise, before they affect growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Finally, the stress-testing framework can be used to analyse the spillover effects of the macroprudential policies themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">For instance, another finding of the framework is that capital-constrained banks are more likely to reduce their foreign exposures than their domestic ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.43,0)">We are particularly concerned about spillover effects of macroprudential policies within the euro area, because the build-up of a capital buffer in one country should, to the extent possible, not impair the functioning of financial intermediation in other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by emphasising that, in a globalised and financially integrated world, the euro area is not immune to spillovers from other regions, in particular to shocks emanating from the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">But we are convinced that we have the appropriate policy tools to largely shield the euro area economy and financial system from such spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.43,0)">Monetary policy and macroprudential policy have different objectives and, therefore, different sets of policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Cyclical factors, such as compressed interest margins, pose challenges to banks’ operating environment, but the gains have so far greatly offset the losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.0,0)">In turn, euro area banks need to address their structural fragilities, which partially explain the very low price-to-book ratios of euro area banks when compared with their international peers.</span>
