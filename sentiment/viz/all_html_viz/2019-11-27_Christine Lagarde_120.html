    <h2> Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, on signing the euro banknotes </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 27 November 2019 Welcome address Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, on signing the euro banknotes I’m honoured to be here to sign the euro banknotes, something that has become a customary ritual for the beginning of each ECB presidency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Before I pick up my pen, however, I would like to say a few words on the importance of this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The great economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said, “When money is bad, people want it to be better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">When it is good, they think of other things”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">His point was that we want sound money not as an end in itself, but because it frees people to do more useful things with their lives: to work, to innovate, to invest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And this, ultimately, is why the ECB exists – to secure that trust in money so that people can focus on what really matters to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is why our mandate and our main objectives reflect the well-known “functions of money”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">We have been tasked with monetary policy and banking supervision to ensure that the euro is safe and stable, and so can serve as an effective store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And our payment systems and banknotes make the euro a dependable medium of exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And while all these tasks form part of our role as custodians of the euro, it is banknotes that are perhaps the most visible task for many European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">They stand out as our most tangible product: we can hold them in our hands and we use them on a daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And our euro banknotes, in different ways, serve as a binding element in the European construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are three dimensions to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The first is the role of banknotes as the lifeblood of our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the euro area, banknotes are used for retail transactions more than any other means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Some 79% of all transactions are carried out using cash, amounting to more than half of the total value of all payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And since their introduction, the number of euro banknotes in circulation has risen steadily, reflecting both the importance of cash in our economy and the euro’s international appeal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are now 23 billion euro banknotes in circulation with a value of €1.26 trillion – a third of which are being used outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This function of banknotes is, of course, common across many advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But there is also a second dimension that is unique to the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Our banknotes reflect a more fundamental development: the decades-long effort to bring Europe closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.82,0)">In a union of diverse countries, it is inherently more difficult to foster a common identity and a sense of shared destiny than in a single country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But the euro is one thing we all have in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">It serves as the most tangible symbol of European integration, a process which has brought peace, freedom and prosperity to our continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And people do feel that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">When they are asked to name the EU’s most positive achievement, euro area citizens generally put the single currency near the top of the list – right after peace among European countries and the free movement of people, goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This reflects the fact that the single currency makes the integration process concrete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Euro banknotes allow us to work, study and travel in 19 different countries without having to exchange money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The euro bears witness to the degree of integration we have achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The third dimension that makes euro banknotes a unifying force in Europe is their design features – they connect us with our shared history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The design of our banknotes is a symbolic representation of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The windows, gateways and bridges symbolise openness and cooperation between the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But rather than depicting actual structures, the designs reflect architectural styles from various periods in Europe's history that have spread across Europe’s borders and shaped our culture – from classical architecture to the iron and glass architecture of the 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This highlights that, despite our diversity, we share a culture that is largely rooted in a common heritage and that has never been contained by national boundaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our shared heritage is also referenced in the security features that protect our banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The hologram and the watermark bear a portrait of Europa, a figure from Greek mythology which serves as the face of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.24,0)">So it is clear that, when I sign my name in a few minutes, I will not simply be undertaking a procedural task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These banknotes are part of our economy, our identity and our culture – and we at the ECB have an immense responsibility to ensure that people maintain their trust in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">So far, we have done a fine job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Support for the euro has reached an all-time high: 76% of our citizens are now in favour of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Trust in our currency is there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But it is said that “trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repair”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">So it’s now our duty to nurture and sustain this trust – by ensuring that banknotes are secure, payments systems are robust, and the value of the euro is stable.</span>
