    <h3> Speaker: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Conventional and unconventional monetary policy Lorenzo Bini Smaghi,Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,Keynote lecture at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies  ,Geneva, 28 April 2009 Introduction   It is a pleasure to be at the Centre International d'Etudes Monétaires et Bancaires to deliver this keynote lecture on unconventional monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.87,0)">This topic has not featured prominently in the speeches given by central bankers in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">But the escalating financial crisis since last autumn has pushed the theme to centre stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Central banks throughout the world have been responding to the crisis by taking both conventional and unconventional policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is important to have a good understanding of the unconventional policies and how they differ from the conventional ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.46,0)">I would like to focus on four groups of questions: First, why and when should central banks resort to such measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There is no tried-and-tested timetable or sign-posted pathway for moving from conventional to unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, an issue to consider is whether unconventional measures should or can be implemented only after the nominal short-term interest rate has reached its lower bound and while downside risks to price stability prevail, or be adopted while interest rates are still positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.78,0)">Second, what are the main characteristics of unconventional measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">Third, how are unconventional measures implemented if and when they are needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To answer this question, we have to distinguish between different types of unconventional measures, from quantitative easing to credit easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.95,0)">Each measure has different effects and counter-effects, depending on the structure of the financial system or other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.03,0)">Fourth, how and when do central banks need to unwind the extra monetary stimulus?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.21,0)">By definition, unconventional measures are not what is generally done, so they are not supposed to become the standard mode of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.17,0)">When deciding on them, monetary policy-makers have to think ahead and ask themselves: “We can get in, but how do we get out?” They need to consider carefully the timing of their withdrawal of such monetary measures – for there are risks in doing it too early, and there are risks in leaving too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">As you might know, the ECB Governing Council will be discussing and taking decisions on the use of unconventional measures on 7 May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.77,0)">My remarks here today, made on a strictly personal basis, in no way prejudge those decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Both my visit here and the subject of my lecture were arranged some time ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My intention today is to offer a rationale for such measures, not to pre-announce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.48,0)">Why implement unconventional policy measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">Let me start with the first question: why and when do central banks need to resort to unconventional policy measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me first clarify what we mean by ‘conventional’ measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Nowadays, monetary policy mainly acts by setting a target for the overnight interest rate in the interbank money market and adjusting the supply of central bank money to that target through open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">To minimise the risk exposure of the central bank’s balance sheet, all liquidity-providing operations normally take place in the form of reverse transactions against a menu of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">In other words, in normal times the central bank is neither involved in direct lending to the private sector or the government, nor in outright purchases of government bonds, corporate debt or other types of debt instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">By steering the level of the key interest rates, the central bank effectively manages the liquidity conditions in money markets and pursues its primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This has proved to be a reliable way of providing sufficient monetary stimulus to the economy during downturns, of containing inflationary pressures during upturns and of ensuring the sound functioning of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.76,0)">But in, so to speak, abnormal times conventional monetary policy tools may prove insufficient to achieve the central bank’s objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Generally, there may be two reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.17,0)">First, the economic shock is so powerful that the nominal interest rate needs to be brought down to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At that level, cutting policy rates further is not possible, so any additional monetary stimulus can be undertaken only by resorting to unconventional monetary policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Broadly speaking, the additional monetary stimulus when the policy interest rate is at zero can be achieved in three complementary ways:   by guiding medium to long-term interest rate expectations,   by changing the composition of the central bank’s balance sheet, and   by expanding the size of the central bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">All of these measures have one element in common: they are designed to improve financing conditions beyond the very short-term interbank interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.12,0)">Second, non-conventional measures may be warranted even when the policy interest rate is above zero if the monetary policy transmission process is significantly impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Under these circumstances, central banks have two   alternatives, namely   to reduce the short term nominal interest rate even further than in normal conditions, and   to act directly on the transmission process by using non-conventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.35,0)">The experience of the past year and a half – a very stressful time for the global financial system – have shown that non-standard tools might be needed even before policy rates have been cut to their lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">When the turmoil started in summer 2007 and central banks worldwide stepped in to provide additional liquidity to financial markets, it appeared that conventional measures could still do the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Although markets were not operating normally, far from it, tensions in the euro area interbank market were considerably eased by supplementary longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.01,0)">But things changed as the crisis intensified in September and October last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the spread between the three-month Euribor and the overnight interest rate EONIA – which in normal times would on average be around 10 basis points – rose to an all-time high of 156 basis points on 13 October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.65,0)">Market liquidity virtually dried up, and the sudden loss of confidence among market participants threatened to have a lasting effect on the orderly functioning of the euro area money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.19,0)">Under these circumstances, easing monetary policy by simply lowering official interest rates would not have been enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.23,0)">Whenever the transmission channel of monetary policy is severely impaired conventional monetary policy actions are largely ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.5,0)">Any policy decision therefore needed to take account of the extraordinary situation in money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">Central banks have different tools to cope with the extraordinary situation in interbank markets, and their choice largely depends on institutional characteristics, but not only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.85,0)">The situation of the banking sector and the types of shock hitting it are also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.83,0)">So while it is tempting to draw cross-country comparisons among such non-conventional measures, it is also rather misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.74,0)">An issue to consider when implementing non conventional policies is the risk of hindering the functioning of markets by substituting or interfering with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.86,0)">Agents’ refinancing needs may become excessively dependent on operations settled with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.04,0)">In other words, financing conditions may become overly attractive as a result of central bank operations and may crowd out other channels, reducing the incentives for restarting normal market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.44,0)">Main characteristics of unconventional measures When conventional tools can no longer achieve the central bank’s objective, policy-makers are confronted with a number of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">First, the unconventional tools include a broad range of measures aimed at easing financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Having this menu of possible measures at their disposal – which are not mutually exclusive ones – monetary policy-makers have to clearly define the intermediate objectives of their unconventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">These may range from providing additional central bank liquidity to banks to directly targeting liquidity shortages and credit spreads in certain market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The policy-makers then have to select measures that best suit those objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.71,0)">Second, they should be wary of the possible side-effects of unconventional measures and, in particular, of any impact on the financial soundness of the central bank’s balance sheet and of preventing a return to a normal market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.41,0)">In general, unconventional measures can be defined as those policies that directly target the cost and availability of external finance to banks, households and non-financial companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">These sources of finance can be in the form of central bank liquidity, loans, fixed-income securities or equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.12,0)">Since the cost of external finance is generally at a premium over the short-term interbank rate on which monetary policy normally leverages, unconventional measures may be seen as an attempt to reduce the spreads between various forms of external finance, thereby affecting asset prices and the flow of funds in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Moreover, since these measures aim to affect financing conditions, their design has to take into account the financial structure of the economy, in particular the structure of the flow of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me elaborate on the possible measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.43,0)">One way to affect the cost of credit would be to influence real long-term interest rates by impacting on market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Expectations may work through several channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.07,0)">For instance, the central bank can lower the real interest rate if it can induce the public to expect a higher price level in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.44,0)">If expected inflation increases, the real interest rate falls, even if the nominal interest rate remains unchanged at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">Alternatively, policy-makers can directly influence expectations about future interest rates by resorting to a conditional commitment to maintain policy rates at the lower bound for a significant period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.93,0)">Since long-term rates are prima facie averages of expected short-term rates, the expectation channel would tend to flatten the entire yield curve when policy-makers commit to stay at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.09,0)">Moreover, a conditional commitment to keep the very short-term rate at the lower bound for long enough should also prevent inflation expectations from falling, which would otherwise raise real interest rates and curtail spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In either case, if the management of expectations is successful, it would – ceteris paribus – reduce the real long term rate and hence foster borrowing and aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.18,0)">Another way in which the central bank can influence the cost of credit is by affecting market conditions of assets at various maturities – for instance, government bonds, corporate debt, commercial paper or foreign assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Two different types of policies can be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first aims at affecting the level of the longer term interest rate of financial assets across the board, independently of their risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such type of policy would operate mainly by affecting the market for risk free assets, typically government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This policy is typically known as ‘quantitative easing’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.25,0)">The second policy is to affect the risk spread across assets, between those whose markets are particularly impaired and those that are more functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Such a policy would be usually referred as ‘credit easing’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.72,0)">The two types of policies affect differently the composition of the central bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.5,0)">Another difference is that ‘credit easing’ can generally be conducted also at above-zero levels of the short-term nominal interest rate, while quantitative easing should make sense only when the interest rate is at zero or very close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, both operations aim at increasing the size of the central bank balance sheet and therefore expanding its monetary liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me now consider quantitative easing and credit easing in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How are unconventional measures implemented?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.5,0)">How can the size and composition of the central bank balance sheets be modified?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The straightforward way is for the central bank to directly purchase assets in the relevant markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">4.1 Direct Quantitative Easing When the central bank decides to expand the size of its balance sheet, it has to choose which assets to buy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In theory, it could purchase any asset from anybody.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In practice, however, quantitative easing has traditionally focused on buying longer-term government bonds from banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The idea is twofold: first, sovereign yields serve as a benchmark for pricing riskier privately issued securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.02,0)">When long-term government bonds are purchased, the yields on privately issued securities are expected to decline in parallel with those on government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Second, if long-term interest rates were to fall, this would stimulate longer-term investments and hence aggregate demand, thereby supporting price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is where banks play a critical role in the success of any quantitative easing policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">If the aim is to ensure that new loans are provided to the private sector, central banks should mainly purchase bonds from the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The additional liquidity would then be used by the banks to extend new credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.14,0)">However, banks may choose to hold the liquidity received in exchange for the bonds in their reserves at the central bank as a buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">In this case, the liquidity provided by the central bank remains within the financial sector; it does not flow out of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This risk can be minimised if the central bank conducts this type of operation only at the lower bound – that is, when it has fully exploited the standard interest rate channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.45,0)">At the lower bound the remuneration of deposits is null   and there is hence little or no incentive for banks to park excess reserves with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Deploying a policy of quantitative easing at a policy rate different from the lower bound may necessitate a larger expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet and thus increase the risk exposure of the monetary authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In light of the above considerations, the soundness of the financial system is critical to the success of quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.25,0)">When banks stop intermediating loans, this policy no longer works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Quantitative easing is successful if it narrows the market spreads between the rates paid on selected credit instruments and policy rates, thereby limiting the risks of a liquidity shortfall and encouraging banks to extend credit to higher interest-paying parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The Bank of Japan’s policy between 2001 and 2006 provides one example of quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It had the following key features: first, it involved a shift in the operational target for money market operations from the uncollateralised overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank of Japan, or in short the bank reserves; second, it entailed outright purchases of Japanese government bonds to meet the target balance of current account deposits at the Bank; and third, it involved an explicit, public commitment to maintain these open market operations until the CPI did not fall on a sustainable basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">During that period, the Bank of Japan had discussions with academics about strategies for avoiding prolonged deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.49,0)">These talks repeatedly gave rise to one particular question: why didn’t the Bank of Japan simply allow the yen to depreciate in order to stop the fall in consumer prices?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is the essence of Lars Svensson’s prominent suggestion of ‘The Foolproof Way’ out of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.0,0)">But if it were so simple, why did the Japanese authorities apparently fail to take the necessary measures to prevent deflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.22,0)">The answer is: it wasn’t that simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.21,0)">What ‘The Foolproof Way’ underestimates is the enormous difficulty of turning around expectations of prices and economic activity when the functioning of the financial system is seriously impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.35,0)">The failures to restructure Japan’s financial and corporate sector and to recapitalise banks have been widely documented as key reasons for the country’s anaemic growth rates and declining prices   – factors over which the Bank of Japan had little control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.59,0)">Let me just add something on that matter: ‘The Foolproof Way’ wouldn’t work in today’s context either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Given the global dimension of the current financial crisis, it would not be possible for all countries to depreciate their currencies at the same time in order to push inflation up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.3,0)">Such a beggar-thy-neighbour policy would be ineffective in the present circumstances; worse, it would aggravate them by unleashing a protectionist backlash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In fact, the leaders of the G20 recently agreed to refrain from competitive devaluation of their currencies, and it is important to stick to this objective in both words and deeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Although not all countries belong to the G20, I am confident that all advanced economies will comply with this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">There are some important lessons we can learn from the experience of quantitative easing in Japan: To begin with, it cannot be taken for granted that an increase in the monetary base results in easier monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.61,0)">In fact, the money multiplier has significantly decreased during the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This has, to a certain extent, reduced the effect of injecting money into the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Second, as mentioned before, the banking system is crucial for the success of a quantitative easing policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.39,0)">However, given the high degree of de-leveraging which the Japanese economy, and the banking sector in particular, was undergoing, banks did not find themselves in a position to pass on the additional liquidity to the non-financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Third, one of the expected effects of quantitative easing is a flattening of the yield curve at longer maturity which improves the medium to longer-term financing conditions for the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But what ultimately matters for investment and spending decisions is the real interest rate and hence inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Strictly speaking, an increase in the money supply should have implications for the expectations of the future price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">But quantitative easing will only affect expected inflation if the increase in the size of the central bank’s balance sheet is not only sizeable but also perceived as being permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The experience of the Bank of Japan provides a clear-cut example of a temporary expansion of the monetary base that did not affect private sector inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Fourth, it is not clear how it is possible to increase inflation expectations in a significant way while avoiding a rise in the nominal long-term interest rate after some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.61,0)">Setting the real long-term interest rate as the operational target for monetary policy seems to be rather challenging in an environment with developed financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Fifth, if quantitative easing is perceived as being long-lasting then it could also have an expansionary effect by relaxing fiscal constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Expansionary fiscal policies represent a sound instrument to stimulate aggregate demand during a deflationary period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In this respect, outright purchases of government bonds by the monetary authority could further strengthen fiscal effects i) by accommodating the supply of governments bonds, ii) by affecting the long-end of the yield curve - the risk premium - and iii) by re-anchoring inflation expectations to a positive target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In particular, the transition to a positive inflation regime reduces the burden on the future fiscal budget by guaranteeing its financial sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Of course, the relevance of this effect crucially depends on the duration of the quantitative easing policy and on a credible commitment to a well-defined exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In this respect, the broad effects stemming from the fiscal and monetary policy mix have been quite muted in stimulating the Japanese economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.06,0)">Finally, it should be recognised that a government bond purchasing programme involves the risk of accumulating significant losses for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Government bonds would be purchased at rather high prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.62,0)">If the easing measure turned out to be a success, the ensuing economic recovery would gradually entail an increase in long-term interest rates; this would bring down government bond prices, so that the central bank would eventually face losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.86,0)">Concerns about central bank’s balance sheet and financial independence can seriously impede monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.08,0)">Such constraints may be one reason why the Bank of Japan’s government bond purchasing programme has failed to restore positive inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me also mention that in the context of the euro area the design of such unconventional policy measures poses some intricate challenges, due to its unique institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In the first place, we need to be mindful of the Treaty requirements relating to the prohibition of monetary financing and the granting of privileged access, as well as of the consistency with the Treaty principle of open market economy and the preservation of the disciplining function of markets for borrowers and lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Although purchases of government bonds are possible in the secondary market, there is a risk to eventually become a market maker for public debt, which could be construed to be against the Treaty prohibition of monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Moreover, we have more than just one fiscal authority in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Eurosystem would have to decide how to spread purchases of government bonds across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.17,0)">If, for example, the Eurosystem only concentrated on public bonds with the best credit rating, it would risk providing privileged access to some countries, contravening Article 102 of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">If it spread purchases according to a specific key and ended up affecting cross-country differences in yields, it would be seen as granting privileged access, as financing conditions for some governments would be supported to a greater extent than for others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It may also be the case that the risk-free component of corporate bonds would not move exactly in tandem with the risk-free component of government bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.65,0)">This would be tantamount to giving preferential treatment to government debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">These issues would need to be addressed before implementing a government bond purchasing programme in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">4.2 Direct Credit Easing Credit easing is a policy that directly addresses liquidity shortages and spreads in certain   market segments through the purchase of commercial paper, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The effectiveness of measures which are aimed at wholesale financial markets depends on their importance in the financing of households and firms, which varies considerably from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">It is also a more attractive strategy in times of acute bank distress, for obvious reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Two things need to be noted here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, buying privately issued securities is not fundamentally different from buying government bonds in terms of the impact on the money supply or the monetary base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Second, buying privately issued securities implies that the central bank interacts directly with the private sector and is thus stepping into the realm of credit risk – just as any normal commercial bank would do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.11,0)">Outright purchases of privately issued securities affect the risk profile of the central bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In order not to compromise the financial independence of the central bank, policy-makers need to carefully assess the eligibility of all assets on account of the implications they could have for the risk exposure of the central bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Caution is also called for in another respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">Outright purchases of privately issued securities need to be carefully planned to avoid allocative distortions in terms of industries, firms or regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.14,0)">Also the size of the issuer matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">While it is easy to see how large firms can benefit from the central bank’s purchases of privately issued securities, it is more difficult to ensure that small and medium-sized companies get equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.64,0)">Given the limited depth of corporate bond markets in many economies, purchases of privately issued securities might therefore be a difficult endeavour for policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The Federal Reserve’s approach since December 2007 has been a high-profile example of credit easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The Fed has established several lending programmes to provide liquidity and improve the functioning of key credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The Term Auction Facility, for instance, helps to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to short-term credit, while the Commercial Paper Funding Facility provides a backstop for the market for high-quality commercial paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">More recently, the Fed, in cooperation with the US Treasury Department, has begun to purchase asset-backed securities such as mortgage securities backed by government-sponsored enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">How effective have these measures been?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.78,0)">It’s too early to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.65,0)">Moreover, with a wide range of unconventional monetary policy measures – since March the Fed has also been purchasing government bonds in parallel – it is extremely difficult to single out the impact of any specific measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.96,0)">That being said, the spreads on eligible commercial paper in the United States have come down following the introduction of the Fed’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.75,0)">Also, the Fed’s purchases of GSE debt and GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities have resulted in a decline of the 30-year conforming mortgage rates by more than one percentage point following the announcement of this programme in late November 2008, and have continued to decline since its expansion on 18 March 2009  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The narrowing of the spread between mortgage rates and Treasuries also suggests that the Fed’s programme of purchasing agency-related mortgage securities may have been effective in easing mortgage market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">4.3 Indirect   Quantitative/Credit Easing The measures described above foresee the direct acquisition by the central bank of the assets, in exchange for central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.13,0)">This implies that the central bank directly holds the assets, until maturity or resale, and thus the risk on its balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">An alternative way is to increase the size of the balance sheet by lending to banks at longer maturities, against collateral which includes assets whose markets are temporarily impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.54,0)">This policy affects directly the yield curve over the horizon at which policy operations are conducted or committed to be conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.14,0)">For instance, monetary policy operations with maturity of 6 months directly affect the 6 months interbank money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is particularly the case if the operations are conducted at a fixed rate, full allotment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">The horizon of the yield curve which is affected may be lengthened to the extent that the central bank commits to conduct such type of tenders for a given period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">For instance, if the central bank commits to conduct 6 months refinancing operations with fixed rate tenders for 2 years, the yield curve over the two and a half year horizon is likely to be influenced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The increase in the monetary base is determined endogenously by the banking system, based on banks’ preference for liquidity and thus on the state of stress of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.71,0)">In normal conditions, when financial markets function properly, the size of the central bank balance sheet would be such that the overnight rate would coincide with the short term refinancing rate of the central bank and excess reserves are negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.81,0)">Under stress, the size of the central bank balance sheet would increase, on the basis of banks’ increased demand for excess reserves, to the point that the overnight rate would be lower than the short term main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Another aspect of such a policy relates to the quality of the collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">By enlarging the pool of the collateral accepted for the refinancing operations with the central bank, the financing conditions by banks to these sectors are facilitated, which should be reflected in the credit spreads that banks charge in particular to the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This technique also enables the counterparties of the central bank to choose the collateral to use in their refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In times of market stress there will be a natural tendency for banks to use a greater amount of assets of a lower quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">The overall collateral deposited with the central bank will vary endogenously, depending on the state of stress of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The eligibility of certain categories of assets for monetary policy operations will facilitate their creation and trade among market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the euro area, the ECB decided to adopt a ‘fixed-rate full-allotment’ procedure: since October 2008 eligible counterparties in the euro area have had access to unlimited liquidity for periods ranging from one week up to six months at a fixed rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">At the same time, we implicitly eased monetary conditions further by expanding the list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Eurosystem accepts a broad range of assets as collateral in all its credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">This feature of the Eurosystem’s collateral framework, together with the fact that access to Eurosystem open market operations is granted to a large pool of counterparties, has been key to supporting the implementation of monetary policy in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The in-built flexibility of its operational framework allowed the Eurosystem to provide the necessary liquidity to address the impaired functioning of the money market without encountering widespread collateral constraints throughout much of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It was only towards the end of the year that, in the light of the extension of refinancing for terms longer than overnight in euro and in US dollars as well as the recourse to fixed rate full allotment tender procedures, the Governing Council decided to expand the list of eligible collateral on a temporary basis until the end of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In 2008 the average amount of eligible collateral increased by 17.2%, compared with 2007, to a total of €11.1 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As regards the composition of collateral put forward, the average share of asset-backed securities increased from 16% in 2007 to 28% in 2008, overtaking uncovered bank bonds as the largest class of assets put forward as collateral with the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.86,0)">Uncovered bank bonds accounted on average for slightly less than 28% of the collateral put forward in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The average share of non-marketable assets increased from 10% in 2007 to 12% in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.25,0)">By contrast, the average share of central government bonds dropped from 15% in 2007 to 10% in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">In my opinion, these changes to our monetary policy implementation can be better characterised as ‘endogenous credit easing’ rather than ‘quantitative easing’, since the main aim is to relax banks' collateral and funding liquidity constraints, so that they will expand credit supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, it is a policy that has been implemented at above-zero level of the short term nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It should also be emphasised that, given the importance of the banking channel in providing credit to the economy, the unconventional policy measures that would best suit the euro area are likely to differ in terms of scope and depth from those in the US or other advanced economies where a more market-based financial system prevails, a consideration that is too often overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is the main reason why our policy response so far has been tailored to the specific nature of Europe’s financial structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.77,0)">A few figures will give an idea of the differences in the financial systems of the US and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For example, at the end of 2007, the stock of outstanding bank loans to the private sector amounted to around 145% of GDP in the euro area, but only to 63% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">By contrast, outstanding debt securities – a measure of the depth of financial markets – amounted to 81% of GDP in the euro area as against 168% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The ECB operations have eased financing conditions for the private sector and allowed banks to refinance loans more easily than would otherwise have been the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The evidence on the extent of these policy measures on market interest rates and money market conditions is quite encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.29,0)">While the spread between the three-month Euribor and the EONIA is now at levels well below 100 basis points as well as at comparable levels or below the corresponding spreads seen in the US and the UK, ECB refinancing operations are also down from a peak of €857 billion at the beginning of the year to 676 billion last Friday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">There is also mounting evidence that the Eurosystem’s policy measures have been effective in averting a dramatic contraction in credit volumes, though credit developments certainly need a close monitoring in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">Exit strategy Let me now turn to the last of the four questions that I posed earlier on: how and when do central banks need to unwind the extra monetary stimulus?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The simple answer to this question would be – of course – when the economy rebounds and inflationary prospects are back in line with the central bank’s price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.92,0)">Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, formulating an adequate exit strategy is not such an easy task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me mention two choices that need to be made: first, devising the right sequence for the phasing out of the conventional and unconventional monetary policy accommodation; second, deciding on the speed at which the unconventional accommodation is removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">Let me first clarify what it means, in practice, to unwind unconventional monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.52,0)">In the case of quantitative easing and credit easing policies, it normally implies selling assets outright, and in significant amounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.11,0)">In the case of the endogenous easing measures, the unwinding happens automatically, since banks should naturally reduce their demand for central bank money and increase interbank lending as their situation normalises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.02,0)">Starting with the problem of the right sequence, it should be reminded that an environment of extremely low interest rates and ample liquidity aims at favouring borrowers and penalising lenders, over the medium term, when the policy is reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">On the other hand, most of the unconventional measures put in place are designed to stimulate lending, to convince savers to hold risky longer-term assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The effectiveness of these measures therefore mainly depends on the readiness of banks to go back to their main business of lending to households and firms rather than parking excess reserves with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.78,0)">Clearly, an increase in policy rates – and in particular in the deposit rate – risks undermining banks’ incentive to re-engage in funding the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.52,0)">In a similar vein, prospects of rising interest rates may discourage private savers from purchasing longer-term assets, as a tightening of monetary policy inevitably implies a capital loss for those who bought these assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.37,0)">Raising policy rates, or the expectation of such increases, when confidence is not fully restored could therefore be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.16,0)">What, then, are the implications for the sequencing of unwinding conventional and unconventional policy measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.69,0)">In simple terms, it means that non-standard measures that aim mainly at restoring the orderly functioning of money markets, such as supplementary longer-term refinancing operations or an extended menu of eligible collaterals, might have to be rolled back before interest rates are increased again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.46,0)">First of all, because raising interest rates in an environment in which such unconventional measures were still judged to be necessary would risk undermining a sustained recovery by money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.18,0)">If concerns about the required and available amounts of short-term funding still prevailed among market participants, raising rates might reinforce these fears and could lead to further, unwarranted upward pressure on overnight rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.8,0)">Second, supplying extra liquidity to the markets through non-standard measures while, at the same time, tightening monetary policy would send mixed signals on the effective monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Measures to alleviate the strains in money markets could in fact be seen as a continued easing of the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.4,0)">Third, with non-standard measures such as the unlimited provision of liquidity still in place it might be more difficult for the central bank to steer the level of market rates consistent with its policy target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.23,0)">For example, a fixed rate tender with full allotment usually leaves the banking sector with a large daily liquidity surplus, which needs to be mopped up by additional fine-tuning operations towards the end of the reserve maintenance period in order to avoid a sharp drop in the overnight interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.41,0)">This, however, causes extra volatility in the markets as well as large interest rate fluctuations that are undesirable from the point of view of an effective signalling of the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.66,0)">Fourth, with markets still in need of additional non-standard measures, the pass-through of an increase in policy rates would probably be hampered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The orderly transmission of any monetary tightening would only resume once trust among market participants has had been restored and money markets were operating normally again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.57,0)">Finally, in any bank-dominated system of fund intermediation, in which the recovery of the economy largely depends on the soundness of the banking system, inflationary pressures that would require a tightening of monetary policy are likely to appear only when the banks take up their normal lending activity again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This, in turn, implies that non-standard measures should ideally be rolled back before interest rates were increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This reasoning might not hold for measures taken to revitalise the flow of credit in certain market segments – such as through the purchase of corporate bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">These measures are primarily designed to bypass the financial sector and to ensure that non-financial corporations still have access to external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Now, in theory, by stimulating longer-term investments and hence aggregate demand, these measures might induce inflationary pressures in the medium to long-term, independent of the functioning of money markets and lending by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The strength of this channel depends on the depth of the corporate bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.16,0)">If policy-makers were to react to these inflationary pressures by raising interest rates pre-emptively while money markets were still weak, the consequences for the banking channel of intermediation could be severe – for the reasons I have just given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">If, however, markets were to function properly again, there would be no reason to postpone the unwinding of ‘credit easing’ policies to a date longer than needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Taken together, this reasoning suggests that purchases of privately issued securities should be unwound before or at the same time as interest rates are raised back to normal levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.74,0)">This raises the question of the reaction that financial markets might have to the start of the unwinding of the direct easing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For instance how would markets react to the central bank starting to sell the government bonds it purchased under the direct quantitative easing policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">Such a start would signal presumably that the tightening cycle is close and could affect yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.46,0)">Furthermore, if the amount of assets to be sold is significant, this can have an impact on the market conditions of the underlying assets, possibly further depressing its price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.02,0)">Naturally, the question remains: how quickly should policy-makers reverse their policies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.32,0)">On the one hand, withdrawing liquidity in such large quantities will trigger a substantial contractionary monetary policy shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.83,0)">The large size of many easing programmes will make it difficult to sell assets without a significant market impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.54,0)">If it happens too quickly or abruptly, policy-makers risk choking off the economic recovery or imposing heavy capital losses on lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.42,0)">For instance, in the corporate bond or commercial paper market, even small sales of securities by the central bank could cause spreads to widen considerably and to sharply tighten credit conditions for firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.99,0)">On the other hand, with policy rates at record low levels and additional liquidity-providing measures adopted in so many countries, the possibility of inflation risks emerging sometime later is not something that can be excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.68,0)">Retaining such exceptional policy measures for too long might aggravate the upside risks to price stability and sow the seeds for future imbalances in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Getting the timing right in withdrawing additional liquidity is likely to be decisive in order to ensure a non-inflationary recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.03,0)">Generally speaking, the lower the reversibility of the non-conventional operations, the larger the risk of being behind the curve when the macroeconomic and financial market situation improves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">Indeed, to a large extent the speed of unwinding of unconventional measures would depend on their degree of reversibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.27,0)">As I already noted, some of the unwinding would happen automatically as central bank programmes become increasingly unattractive as financial conditions normalise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">For instance, many lending facilities provide liquidity at a premium over the main policy rate or with a high haircut applied to the required collateral, making interbank lending the more attractive option once normal lending activity among market participants is restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">As a result, the central bank’s balance sheet would decline automatically as demand for its funds decreases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.89,0)">As noted, the ECB’s current liquidity-providing operations imply an ‘endogenous’ exit strategy as banks would automatically seek less credit from the ECB when tensions in financial markets ease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">The speed of the reversibility would therefore largely depend on the speed of the resurgence of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In the euro area, the revitalisation of money markets is key to the ECB’s exit strategy and any future interest rate decision should therefore avoid a further disruption of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">In this context, bringing the main policy rate too close to zero would risk hampering the functioning of the money markets as it would reduce the incentives for interbank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.57,0)">This, in turn, could blur the important signals coming otherwise from the resurgence of interbank lending and the associated positive effect on the ECB’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">Obviously, the speed of tightening would also depend on the maturity of the assets bought by central banks within the framework of their easing programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Differences in the maturity of assets will ensure that a tightening of the accommodative stance would come in gradual tranches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.0,0)">This is important to avoid any abrupt tightening of credit conditions in the middle of the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.76,0)">At the same time, measures centered on assets that are longer-term in nature and less liquid could pose challenges to the future unwinding of these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.18,0)">If market conditions were to improve faster than expected, an increase in the average maturity of the central bank’s portfolio would make it more difficult for financial markets to return to normal private sector functioning and would also heighten medium-term inflation risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Overall, special operations other than the traditional repurchase agreements might be needed to sterilise the effects of unconventional policy measures at the appropriate time in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One option would be to have the fiscal authority issue debt certificates to the market and deposit the proceeds with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The switch in the ownership of government debt from the private sector to the monetary authority would alleviate the inflationary pressures arising from the additional liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Another option would be for the central bank to issue debt certificates itself, as the ECB for example can do according to its Statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this way the central bank would essentially change the composition of the liabilities side of its balance sheet, moving away from excess reserves and towards less-liquid debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The effect, compared with government debt issuance, would in essence be the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">An important final element related to the exit strategy, but which should be considered carefully already when deciding to embark on unconventional measures, is that when the central bank sells the assets their value is likely to have declined considerably, given the higher rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.64,0)">This implies a financial loss for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.79,0)">The consequences for the financial – and overall – independence of the central bank should not be downplayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, the decision whether to embark on non-conventional monetary policy measures, which specific ones and for how long depends on a series of considerations, including the overall conditions of the economy, in particular the presence of deflationary pressures and the effective constraint provided by the zero lower bound for interest rates, the structure of the financial flows in the economy, the medium term incentives that would be created for the private sector and the risks entailed in the exit strategy, including for the independence and credibility of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Some measures present greater advantages, in terms of providing the right incentives and being easily reversible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Others present more risks and have to be well targeted and used under specific circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Considering the pros and cons of the various measures requires deep thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I have tried to develop tonight some of the considerations underlying such a reflection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Hopefully this has been useful in understanding why the ECB has proceeded speedily in some areas while taking the necessary time to reflect on others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
