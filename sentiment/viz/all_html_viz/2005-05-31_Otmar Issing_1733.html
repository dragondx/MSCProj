    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)"> The euro and European financial market integration Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB8th German Corporate Conference, Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 31 May 2005 Introduction It is a pleasure for me to deliver a speech on the euro and European financial market integration here at the Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Frankfurt has recently become the home of the European Central Bank and the euro and is the place at which the in 1870 founded Deutsche Bank in 1886 opened a branch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The history of the Deutsche Bank reflects the economic and political relations of several German generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">The Deutsche Bank’s initial capital was denominated in the Taler, the old Preussian currency, succeeded by the Mark, Rentenmark, Reichsmark and, in 1948, by the Deutsche Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The new-born generation will only experience the Deutsche Bank capital denominated in the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The topic of today is of natural interest to all of us: bankers, firms, households, central bankers and other policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">A high degree of financial integration increases the efficiency of the economy, by reducing the cost of capital and improving the allocation of financial resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This will ultimately lead to higher and more sustainable non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Financial integration also fosters the diversification of activities and risks of financial institutions and thus the efficiency and soundness of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.28,0)">This will result in higher productivity in the financial sector and therefore higher welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, for the smooth functioning of the single monetary policy it is important that decisions are not channelled to euro area countries in a non-uniform manner due to fragmented financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">For all these reasons, the European Central Bank strongly supports efforts aimed at enhancing the European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">I will argue that those financial markets that are crucial for the transmission of the ECB monetary policy are nowadays satisfactorily integrated and that the euro has played a very important role to come so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Imperfections hampering a more advanced degree of European financial integration remain, however, and I will discuss ways forward to tackle these obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Main features of present situation The present situation of European financial integration is the result of several policy initiatives that have been set up to lift obstacles and so to promote financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The most important stimulus has been the establishment of the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular Stage Three with the introduction of the euro and a single monetary policy in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Before speaking about the impacts of the euro on the European financial market integration, I would like to elaborate on the current degree of financial market integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How integrated are European financial markets nowadays?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">The answer depends on the segment of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The degree of integration of the wholesale financial markets in the euro area is very advanced, but the retail financial markets are comparatively more fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Following the introduction of the single monetary policy and the ceasing of exchange rate risk among euro area countries, a liquid money market with single interbank market interest rates was established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A large share of the daily transactions in this market is cross-border.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is very important, since any change in official ECB interest rates first affects the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The degree of integration of the secured money markets, such as the repo market, is high, but less advanced than unsecured money markets due to a still fragmented infrastructure for these money market transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The distinction in the degree of integration in the two segments of the money market is illustrated in Charts 1 and The ratios between average cross-country EONIA/EURIBOR rate deviations and average within-country deviations remained close to one since 1999 onwards, whereas the ratios between average cross-country EUREPO rate deviations and average within-country deviations have been somewhat higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In the government bond market segment, the degree of market integration is also high, given the convergence of bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.75,0)">Government bond yields tend to be driven predominantly by common news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.51,0)">Government bond yields convergence is not perfect nor should it be so, given the presence of different credit and liquidity risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The issuance activity at the euro-denominated bond market is nowadays higher than the sum of all issuances in former national currency denominated bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">This holds particularly for the private segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Both charts are consistent with a high degree of integration in the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Also equity markets in the euro area are reasonably well integrated, but less than money and bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Integration is manifest through changes in the fundamentals underlying equity markets, such as increasing synchronisation of macroeconomic activities across the euro area, increasing reliance on intra-European trade and the internationalisation of corporate ownership and of the scope of corporate activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Also the convergence of equity premia can be associated with enhancing financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Equity returns in the various euro area equity markets have increasingly been determined by common euro area factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The introduction of new European stock indices has made it easier to gauge performance, and the trend to diversify equity investments across Europe has appreciably increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Institutional investors increasingly hold foreign shares in their portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.42,0)">The integration of retail markets, such as loans to households and small and medium-sized enterprises, is lagging behind compared with the wholesale markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.5,0)">This becomes evident from persistently cross-country differences for these bank lending rates and the rather limited cross-border retail banking activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">National banking sectors have remained largely segregated with only marginal cross-border penetration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Still less than 5% of total bank loans are granted cross-borders to customers in other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.94,0)">Impacts of the euro What have the impacts of the euro been on the current state of the degree of European financial market integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The euro has played a very important catalysing role for the financial integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">Several impacts of the euro on the financial integration process in Europe have become evident over the past six years, although the time span since the introduction of the euro is still too short for drawing definitive conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In parallel with the euro’s catalysing role in this regard, a host of other factors might have contributed to enhancing financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">These include the various steps towards gradual economic integration, structural and technological changes, globalisation and liberalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Looking at the actual use of the euro in international capital and foreign exchange markets as well as an international financing currency, we observe that the euro share has remained broadly stable in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">The euro share in the total stock of international debt securities was in 2004 31% and in foreign exchange transactions 37% based on survey results and 44% based on foreign exchange trades settled via Continuous Linked Settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">There have been signs of an increasing use of the euro as an international settlement and invoicing currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will today focus on three, interrelated, impacts of the euro on financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Market- versus bank-based financing While bank-based finance continues to be important in the euro area after the introduction of the euro there has been a clear trend towards market-based financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This can be seen in traditional market segments, such as the fixed income and equity markets, but even more in “non-traditional” market segments, such as mortgage-backed and assets-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The growing importance of securitisation transactions is reflected in the remarkable growth of bonds issued by euro area non-monetary financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.64,0)">What has the size of the impact of the euro on the euro area corporate bond market growth been?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.3,0)">Tentative empirical evidence for the first five years of the euro suggests that the euro indeed has had a statistically sizeable direct impact on bonds issued by non-monetary financial corporations, which are mainly securitisation transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Issuers moved towards a euro area-wide perspective and benefited from easier access to the larger investor base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The euro and the idea of truly integrated euro area financial markets also have played an indirect effect by triggering a wave of mergers and acquisitions that, at least in part, has been funded by bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Conducting business in a common currency across the euro area had widened the market perspective of corporations to reach a sufficient euro area scale through mergers and acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The size of this indirect impact of the euro has been estimated to be up to 2½ percentage points per year of the annual bond market growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The amount outstanding of bonds issued by euro area non-financial and non-monetary financial corporations tripled since the end of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The euro area corporate bond market has not only remarkably grown in quantitative terms, but also its qualitative nature has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The euro area corporate bond market is nowadays characterised by large issues with all possible investment and speculative-grade ratings from all types of economic sectors and typically low underwriting fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For example, Telecom Italia managed earlier this year to successfully open the 50-year segment in the euro corporate bond market, just several weeks after the French Treasury had done so in the government bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">As a consequence, bond markets are gaining importance as means of obtaining corporate finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Relationship banking Banks are increasingly adapting to the trend towards more market-based financing and thus transaction banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As a consequence, the nature of relationship banking is gradually changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Again, this process is not only influenced by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.95,0)">Irrespective of the euro, relationship banking has come under pressure in recent years because more and more bank customers are no longer putting their foot in any bank office.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">They arrange their bank business from a distance, by mail, phone or especially via internet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.66,0)">The personal face of the bank employee has been replaced by a computer screen for a growing number of bank customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The first consequence of banks’ adoption to more market-based finance is that they generate more fee incomes from market-based transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The relation changes from banks providing funds to firms into banks assisting corporate clients in tapping the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.59,0)">The nature of relationship banking is also affected by the rapidly growing securitisation markets since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Securitisation allows banks to broaden and deepen the relation with their customers without necessarily keeping the loans on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255.0,0)">Banks exploit their private information about the quality of the debtor or their greater ability to assess the value of the debtor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The separation of the origination and funding of credit from the allocation of the credit risk facilitates a broader dispersion of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With wider access to credit risk exposure, banks can reduce their vulnerability to idiosyncratic or industry-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Securitisation provides banks the possibility to broaden and deepen their relation to, for instance, the car industry without increasing their exposure to that sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Another consequence of the broadening and deepening of the euro area corporate bond market, including securitisation transactions, is that the supply of credit can be less dependent on conditions affecting banks’ ability and willingness to grant a loan or take credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Multiple avenues of corporate finance, that is the co-existence of a well-developed bank and market-based finance system, could in principle reduce the urgent need from corporate clients for the availability of bank credit during “bad times”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">A broad, deep and liquid euro area corporate bond market can now be tapped for finance when banks cut back on lending or corporate profits are under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">Consequently, relationship banking, in the sense of banks granting loans at all times, might weaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.94,0)">Does this all lead to a disappearing of relationship banking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">No, relationship banking will remain strong especially for households and those firms that are more exposed to asymmetric information, such as small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Bank customers may continue their habit of conducting local business according to regional conventions as long as costs of local information gathering, cultural and linguistic barriers exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Pass-through of monetary policy Banks also adapted to the change in corporate loan demand deriving from firms directly tapping capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.15,0)">Banks have changed their price setting behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Tentative empirical results suggest a quicker retail bank interest rate pass-through since the introduction of the euro in most segments of the retail bank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What might explain the quicker retail bank interest rate pass-through in the euro area since the introduction of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">Likely economic explanations are lower interest rate variability and premia and lower pricing power of banks since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The higher stability of nominal interest rates across the maturity spectrum in an environment of medium-term price stability and the decline in money market variability facilitates the comparison of prices across different suppliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.55,0)">As a consequence, bank customers have become more sensitive to changes in the interest rates on bank loans and deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Moreover, the ongoing consolidation of the European banking sector seems to have promoted higher efficiency in the banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.07,0)">Traditional funding of bank loans by domestic deposits has declined since the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Notwithstanding the consolidation in the banking industry, new players have become active in the retail bank market, such as internet banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.55,0)">Banks also face intensified competition from other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.48,0)">Remaining imperfections Notwithstanding the substantial progress over recent years towards further financial market integration, imperfections remain at European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will focus on the retail credit markets, while their integration is comparatively less advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will distinguish between two, interrelated, issues: infrastructure and cross-border market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Infrastructure The distinction between the degree of integration between the wholesale and retail segment is also manifest in the payments and settlements systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.05,0)">Whereas wholesale transactions take place in integrated systems, such as TARGET, the retail payments systems are still fragmented, especially due to the fact of a lack of common standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Only in recent years banks started to develop pan-European retail payment products and systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.83,0)">The main obstacles to tackle are the higher fees for cross-border transactions than for domestic ones and differences in legal systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Cross-border market integration Cross-border market integration allows banks to diversify their loan portfolio, improving their risk-return profile, and to reduce liquidity risk by diversifying their deposit base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Of course, these gains will only be realised if existing markets differ from one another in terms of business cycle and industry structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.95,0)">The number and value of bank merger and acquisition deals were high in 1998 to 2000, but strongly declined afterwards and were predominantly of a domestic nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These developments suggest some remaining frictions for cross-border bank consolidation, an issue closely followed by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.17,0)">Another related aspect is the low degree of internationalisation of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The share of foreign banks in the total assets of the EU-15 banks has been less than a quarter in 2003 and rarely higher than before 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">Moreover, striking differences exist across EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In the new EU member states the share is on average higher than two third.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Also in a financial centre such as Luxembourg the banking sector is dominated by foreign banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Ways forward What are the ways forward in lifting these remaining obstacles?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">All market participants, that are banks, bank customers and central banks, should contribute to this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Banks will contribute by the creation of a Single European Payment System.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Not least to – let us call it strong encouragement – by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, the European banking industry will introduce a new euro area payment schemes for electronic credit transfers and direct debits as well as a unified framework for debit and credit cards by January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">This is a very positive development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this payment system cross border euro transactions can be carried out with the same efficiency and quality as domestic euro payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">One bank account is then in principle sufficient for the whole euro area, since the new system is likely to apply initially only to the euro area, and not immediately to the whole European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Another contribution of banks is to foster efficiency and productivity in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This could take the form of continued consolidation at the national level and of enhanced cross-border market integration, aiming to reap the full benefits of economies of scale and scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The household credit markets could particularly potentially benefit from these efficiency and productivity gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Bank customers will also contribute to enhance the retail integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Firms and households will increase their cost awareness and frequency to regularly reassess their fidelity towards their chosen service provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A growing availability of internet sites that provide price and product advices are likely to strengthen retail bank customers’ cost and product awareness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Finally, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to a smooth functioning and integration of European financial markets and thus to economic growth and satisfactory employment prospects is to maintain a steady medium-term price stability orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Such a policy will be beneficial, as it will minimise the adverse effects of inflation and high inflation uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.54,0)">In an environment of low inflation expectations, inflation risk premia become less and less important as a determinant of financial prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Ultimately, this results in a more efficient allocation of financial resources and therefore higher welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">Concluding remarks Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">What are the lessons to take home?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Firstly, the wholesale financial market integration in Europe is very advanced, whereas the integration of the retail sector is lagging behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">European firms and households have already benefited from financial integration, through the efficiency gains of wholesale integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Further potential benefits for retail bank customers are within reach if integration were to come to the final stage of the value-added chain, in the retail financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Secondly, the euro has played a very important catalysing role for the observed enhanced financial market integration since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.6,0)">The third lesson is that the main remaining imperfections hindering European financial integration are in the retail payments and settlements infrastructure and limited cross-border market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">My fourth and final message is that all of us: banks, firms, households, and central banks, can and should contribute to the challenging and inspiring process of European financial market integration.</span><span style="background-color:
