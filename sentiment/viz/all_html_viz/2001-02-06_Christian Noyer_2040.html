    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)"> Current issues in monetary policy Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of a conference organised by l'Université Robert Schuman, Institut des Hautes Etudes Européennes   Strasbourg, 6 February 2001 Ladies and gentlemen,   It is both a pleasure and an honour for me to speak here at the conference of "L'Observatoire des politiques économiques en Europe" in Strasbourg and to have the opportunity to present some of the "current issues" surrounding the Eurosystem and the ECB's monetary policy before such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For a central bank, it is essential to attain public understanding and acceptance, so the ECB is endeavouring to explain its policy to a broader public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We believe that communication and transparency are key elements of modern central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.64,0)">The ECB's monetary policy strategy has been a much-debated issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Therefore, I should like to begin with this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In designing the ECB's monetary policy strategy, the ability to deal with structural changes and with the issue of uncertainty has been of the utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I shall elaborate on these issues later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally, I shall turn to our assessment of the current economic and monetary situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The ECB's two-pillar strategy The ECB has chosen its own strategy to best suit its particular circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The strategy is well equipped to deal with the uncertainties surrounding monetary policy in general and the introduction of the euro in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It provides a clearly defined framework for guiding monetary policy decisions and for explaining these decisions to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me briefly recall the principal features of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">First of all, the ECB has given itself a forward-looking, medium term-oriented strategy aimed at fulfilling its primary objective: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The first element of the strategy is the quantification of what the Governing Council understands by price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This is defined as an annual increase of below 2% in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This definition serves to anchor inflation expectations and provides a framework against which the Eurosystem can be held accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It clearly emphasises the euro area-wide focus of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.45,0)">Short-term fluctuations in the inflation rate are not under the control of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Therefore, it was also announced that price stability is to be maintained over the medium term, imparting a medium-term orientation to the strategy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In order to fulfil its primary objective, the ECB's monetary strategy relies on two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A central bank has a natural interest, but also a comparative advantage in analysing monetary developments, because money is - if I may say so - the central bank's "output".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">There is broad empirical evidence of a long-term stable relationship between money and prices and good leading indicator properties of money in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The prominent role of money is signalled by the announcement of a reference value for the annual rate of growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This reference value represents a visible public commitment to analysing and explaining monetary developments and their implications for price stability in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In December 2000, the Governing Council of the ECB reconfirmed the reference value of 4 1/2% annual growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This rate should be consistent with price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">While the reference value plays an important role in monetary analysis, the assessment of the first pillar goes beyond the evaluation of the deviation of M3 growth from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It encompasses a variety of approaches which assign a central role to money because of the ultimately monetary nature of inflation, as well as a detailed analysis of the components and counterparts of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Thus, an in-depth analysis of the overall liquidity conditions in the euro area is provided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.89,0)">Despite broad consensus on the fact that inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, the assessment of monetary developments alone does not give an accurate picture of the state of the economy and of the potential risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Therefore, for a robust strategy, it is useful to analyse additional indicators relevant for future price stability and to combine them under a second pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The second pillar of the ECB's strategy ensures that the interplay between supply and demand in the real economy is sufficiently taken into consideration when evaluating the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It comprises a variety of predominantly non-monetary factors, which are relevant for future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Some of the factors of the second pillar can be especially relevant in the short term, for example the development of oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.84,0)">For monetary policy decisions, it is important to know whether, for example, shocks originate from the supply side or from the demand side of the economy, whether they exert a temporary or permanent influence on prices, or whether they result from a domestic or an external source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.88,0)">As we have experienced in the past few months, an oil price shock, which is an external shock from the supply side, can exert a significant direct influence on consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.98,0)">In such a situation, the central bank has to assess whether this direct effect will remain temporary or whether it will translate into a more permanent impact on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.04,0)">This depends to a large extent on the ability of central banks to keep inflation expectations low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Other indicators of the second pillar, for example the development of labour costs, have a more medium-term content.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Under the second pillar of the strategy, the production of macroeconomic projections for real GDP growth and inflation enables some of the factors considered to be structured and summarised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">The staff of the ECB and the national central banks have already been providing twice-yearly projections to the Governing Council since the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Starting with the December 2000 issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin, these projections are now regularly made available to the public alongside other indicators and other forms of analysis underlying the ECB's monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Let me emphasise that the publication of projections reflects the ECB's commitment to openness and transparency in sharing the information and analyses underlying its monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">Furthermore, it does not in any way change the ECB's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The projections are only one element of the second pillar considered by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">Economic projections can only provide a partial summary of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.84,0)">They cannot possibly contain all the information needed to take appropriate policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.33,0)">In particular, the results do not in themselves reveal the nature of a shock hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">The appropriate monetary policy to maintain price stability should always depend on the specific circumstances and the nature and magnitude of a threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For example, the appropriate response to a one-off increase in oil prices may differ from that given to a wage-price spiral, even if both have the same impact on inflation projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore, projections must always be supplemented by economic assessments and a detailed analysis of individual indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.88,0)">The ECB's strategy has sometimes been criticised for being rather complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, we are convinced that a simple approach would not have been appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Neither a purely monetary approach nor a purely non-monetary approach to the analysis of risks to price stability is able to deliver the best possible results for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.26,0)">In the beginning, we were sometimes criticised for "not having decided" between a strategy clearly based on a purely monetary objective and one based on pure inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">However, I strongly believe that we have made the right decision, as we have only one primary objective: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We have also decided in favour of a robust strategy in order to achieve our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This enables us to use a variety of approaches, involving different analytical frameworks and indicators, which are relevant for our primary objective of price stability in our decision-making process, and to cross-check the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This approach provides the best possible basis for monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">So far, both pillars have given broadly similar indications with regard to the primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.53,0)">However, this does not necessarily have to be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let us suppose that both pillars were to point in different directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Would it really be better if only one of these signals were available?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This would undoubtedly make the decision process easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But, seriously, faced with uncertainty - and that is an essential characteristic of the world we live in - I do believe that it is advantageous to take more than one approach into consideration and not to rely on a single analytical framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">That is basically the rationale for our two-pillar strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Furthermore, over the first two years of Monetary Union, there has come to be greater understanding that this is indeed a sensible approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.03,0)">Monetary policy in an environment of structural change Central banking entails, by definition, acting under uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">While this statement holds true in general, it is particularly the case for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The introduction of the euro had the potential to trigger structural changes in financial, goods and labour markets, which are in part already visible today and may evolve further in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">With regard to financial markets, the integration of national money markets into one area-wide money market has been almost without friction since the very start of Stage Three, which has allowed for an efficient implementation of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the other segments of the financial markets, considerable progress has been made, although the integration process is far from complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The removal of barriers to exchange rate risk between the countries of the euro area helped to facilitate the standardisation of debt instruments and widen the range of investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Portfolio allocation strategies within the euro area are now mainly oriented towards a sectoral selection and, to a lesser extent, a national selection of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">That is an impressive indication of the ongoing integration of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This trend, in turn, enhances the liquidity of markets and affects the financing decisions taken by companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Direct financing via capital markets is growing in importance, even though banks are still the most important source of financing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Such changes in the financial landscape make the allocation of funds more efficient and are hence most welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.02,0)">At the same time, however, they alter the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and insofar as this alteration is difficult to measure, add uncertainty to monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.04,0)">Apart from the financial environment, the real economy in the euro area is also currently subject to significant change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Monetary Union has enhanced competition between economic agents in the participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Price transparency between the countries has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Both consumers and companies are becoming increasingly more aware of price differences and are reacting accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.91,0)">Greater price differences will be harder to justify and maintain, even though differences in the tax systems and in product specifications will continue to exert an influence on price setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.34,0)">Fiscal policy may be affected, both by increased competition between countries and by the general need to foster employment and growth in order to comply with the challenges of ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These realities have triggered tax cuts and the start of more fundamental benefit reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">However, these efforts must be accompanied by a structural reduction in expenditure in order to support price stability, make further progress in fiscal consolidation and boost economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Overall, the increase in competition, less rigidity and a more flexible structure of the economy should lead to an increase in the sustainable rate of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, it is difficult to evaluate the extent of these structural changes and to gauge how quickly their impact will be felt on medium-term growth, particularly at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In addition to the specific factors resulting from the introduction of the euro, the rapid change in information and communication technology is likely to add further potential for structural changes in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The possible emergence of a "New Economy" may raise the economy's productive capacity temporarily or on a more permanent basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Much faster data transfer and the increased transparency of information in a knowledge-based society could enhance efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Even if some of the euphoria surrounding the start of a new economic era has dissipated, as could be seen in stock market developments over the last few months, there remains a remarkable potential for economic change in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To date, however, clear evidence of positive effects on the supply side, which may lead to a temporary or even permanent higher potential output growth, is still lacking for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.28,0)">In addition, it should be borne in mind that the expectation of higher growth and positive wealth effects may also lead to inflationary pressures from the demand side of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.71,0)">Therefore, the implications of the "New Economy" for monetary policy are far from clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary policy-makers, whose aim is to maintain price stability, need to exercise particular caution in such an environment of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I am confident that the ECB is well equipped to cope with this challenge, not least due to the "full information approach" chosen in the form of the two-pillar-strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.48,0)">Of course, not only central bankers face uncertainty, but also private agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Given this situation, the central bank itself must be an even greater source of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It must not only avoid any actions which may bring uncertainty to the economy, but must try to stabilise the expectations of private agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.44,0)">When private agents are uncertain about the objective and the commitment of the central bank to this objective, they tend to shorten their planning horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.6,0)">They therefore become less predictable, which ultimately leads to a less foreseeable economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Thus, it is crucial for a central bank to define its policy objective and its strategy clearly and to provide a stable and broadly predictable pattern of behaviour to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.99,0)">In addition, central banks should avoid pursuing an activist monetary policy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.51,0)">they should avoid attempts to fine-tune the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In general, the limited knowledge of the monetary transmission process favours a clear medium-term orientation in order to accurately assess the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The current monetary and economic situation in the euro area Let me finally turn to the current monetary and economic situation and its implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.46,0)">As you are no doubt aware, the ECB has kept interest rates unchanged since the beginning of October last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This policy reflects the fact that risks to price stability in the medium term have become more balanced over the past few months, although some factors which may pose upward risks still remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, monetary data for December 2000 confirmed the moderation of monetary dynamics, which has been observed since the spring of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.94,0)">The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from October to December, stood at 5.0%, slightly lower than the 5.1% for the period from September to November 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Hence, the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly more balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">However, some caution is still warranted, given the previous protracted period of upward deviations of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Broadly similar indications are emerging from the second pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.54,0)">This year, real GDP growth may be somewhat weaker than last year, and inflationary pressures stemming from previously higher oil prices and a low external value of the euro may gradually disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Nevertheless, there is also need for some caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.25,0)">The external environment of the euro area is currently surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.94,0)">After several years of impressive economic growth in the United States, the slowdown in growth there may be more significant than previously anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.54,0)">Obviously a considerably weaker economic performance of the United States, which accounts for slightly more than 20% of world GDP, would have implications for world economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, on the basis of the information available at present, it is likely that world economic activity will remain at an acceptable level this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In addition, it should be borne in mind that the euro area itself is also a large domestic market - it is, in fact, the second largest in the world - accounting for over 15% of world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">Exports of goods and services only amount to around 17% of euro area GDP: this implies that the influence of external trade on real economic growth is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Instead, euro area economic activity is mainly influenced by domestic factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Economic growth in the euro area has recovered considerably since the second half of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Real GDP growth is expected to have been around 3 1/2% in 2000, compared with an average real GDP growth of 2% in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.21,0)">Real GDP growth in the euro area has slowed down somewhat since the second half of 2000, as demonstrated in recently published GDP data and short-term indicators, such as industrial production and, to some extent, the European Commission's industrial confidence indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, at the same time, this indicator, together with the capacity utilisation rate, have remained at a high level and continue to give a relatively favourable picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Regarding private consumption, the European Commission's consumer confidence indicator recovered on average in December and January, following a dip in the previous months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">In particular, private households were more optimistic about the future economic situation as well as their own financial situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.97,0)">The data confirm the view that the earlier decline in consumer confidence was mainly due to the adverse effects of the increase in oil prices until November 2000, which dampened private household real disposable income growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Overall, consumer confidence has continued to remain at a high level, reflecting favourable financing conditions and improving conditions in the labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The latter is indicated by a robust growth in employment and a further decline in the unemployment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In addition, tax reductions in a number of euro area countries can be expected to fuel domestic demand this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">All in all, it seems likely that real GDP will continue to expand at a robust pace this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Hence, there is reason to be optimistic with regard to further economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.06,0)">Turning to price developments, inflation fell to 2.6% in December, down from 2.9% in November, reflecting the decrease in oil prices in euro terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.31,0)">Provided that this drop in oil prices and the recovery in the effective exchange rate of the euro are sustained, the annual rate of consumer price inflation is expected to fall to below 2% in the course of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, this may take some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.39,0)">Over the short term, the process may be slowed down by the delayed impact of previous import price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.63,0)">Given the present situation, potential second-round effects remain a risk to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Against this backdrop, it is important to proceed with wage moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Moreover, it is essential that fiscal policy meet the obligations of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Continuing progress in fiscal consolidation should be achieved by containing public spending growth, allowing for both a reduction in remaining budget deficits and an alleviation of the fiscal burden on corporations and private households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Concluding remarks Overall, it is fair to say that the first two years of the euro have been a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.72,0)">At the start of Monetary Union, the economic environment in the euro area was still in the aftermath of the Asian and Russian crises, rendering considerable uncertainty to world economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">At present, the economic situation in the euro area is much more favourable, even though uncertainties from the external environment have increased recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Admittedly, consumer price inflation currently stands above 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">However, this development is mainly due to direct effects stemming from the external oil price shock, which cannot be prevented by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It is very positive for the credibility of the ECB that under these circumstances inflation expectations have remained contained, as reflected, for example, in financial market indicators and survey data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This shows that the ECB's stability orientation is properly understood by the markets and by the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I am also optimistic about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The maintenance of price stability over the medium term will contribute significantly to the achievement of sustainable economic growth and to the economic welfare of the population in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">If other policy areas also play their part, we have reason to be confident about the future of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Finally, I should like to draw your attention to one particular challenge which will take place this year or, to be more precise, at the end of this year: the introduction of euro banknotes and coins and the general changeover to the euro as the new unit of currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">As far as the Eurosystem is concerned, it is our responsibility to ensure that the printing of around 14.5 billion euro banknotes, representing a value of some EUR 650 billion, and the bringing into circulation of the banknotes and coins, is successfully completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">In order to achieve this, we have planned an information campaign, with the aim of familiarising those living both inside and outside the euro area with the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Beginning on 1 September 2001, euro area banknotes and coins will be frontloaded to credit institutions, which will then sub-frontload them to professional groups  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">From the second half of December 2001, the general public in several Member States will receive starter kits containing a mixture of denominations of euro coins in order to facilitate initial purchases in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">I am truly convinced that the visible introduction of the euro will be a decisive step in the further integration of the euro area, as well as in increasing the acceptance of the euro by the population of the euro area and abroad.</span>
