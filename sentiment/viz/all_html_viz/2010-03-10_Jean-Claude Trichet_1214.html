    <span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)"> Address on the occasion of the inauguration of the “Language of Money” exhibition and the Euro Exhibition at the Museum für Kommunikation in Frankfurt am Main Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main,10 March 2010 Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at the Museum für Kommunikation in Frankfurt for the inauguration of two exhibitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">First, it is a particular honour for me, in my capacity as patron, to open the “Language of Money” exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">And, of course, it also gives me great pleasure to open the European Central Bank’s Euro Exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">These two complementary exhibitions share similar themes, of interest to me as a central banker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They explore the history, practicalities and overall role that money plays in our lives, and are indeed both very enlightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Whatever language we speak, there is no doubt that money plays an important role in communication, conveying messages directly or indirectly about our society, our status and our values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The “Language of Money” exhibition examines the role that money plays in our lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Naturally I am very interested in the language of money and, in particular, the language of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The euro should speak both of Europe’s diversity and its common culture, its history and its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And indeed it does, through the architectural motifs on our banknotes and the cultural symbols on the national sides of our coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Take the name “euro”, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">When choosing the name, it was purposely decided that it should not favour any specific language, but speak rather of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And so the word “euro” entered our vocabulary: a new word for a new European currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Today, of course, the word does not seem new at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The euro has become one of the most tangible elements of Europe for the 330 million European citizens who use the euro as their common currency on a daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Since the creation of the euro, it has also become clear how important a role the single currency can play in the realisation of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The number of countries participating in Economic and Monetary Union has grown over the years and today the euro is used in 16 Member States of the European Union, covering an area that stretches from Cyprus to Ireland and from Portugal to Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The euro also has a recognised role beyond Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Also on the international stage, people have confidence in the euro as a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And this confidence is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">You will recall my earlier comment that the euro speaks a language of both common culture and diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">You will see evidence of this in the European Central Bank’s Euro Exhibition, which is also on show here, having just come to the end of a successful showing at the Museum für Kommunikation’s partner museum in Berlin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As you walk through the Euro Exhibition, you will without doubt recognise the images of bridges, which feature on the back of our euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The bridges symbolise communication between the people of Europe, and between Europe and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">They also represent the connection between past and future, and symbolise our European future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">If you look at the national sides of the euro coins, you will see evidence of the diversity that I have spoken of, with national icons and symbols representing the national heritage and culture of each Member State of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Overall, the Euro Exhibition provides visitors with an opportunity to familiarise themselves with our currency, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Various interactive displays enable them to explore subjects ranging from the history of money to the production of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You can also learn how to check the security features of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Lastly, as the euro is the currency of euro area citizens of all ages, the Euro Exhibition also takes the younger generation into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the kids’ corner, children can enjoy the educational computer games, learn more about the features of euro banknotes from the interactive displays or follow the story of Anna and Alex as they catch counterfeiters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">For those of you here who have children, this is a good opportunity for them to learn about the euro in an entertaining way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Before I conclude, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Kugler, Mr Gold and their teams for their cooperation and for making this evening a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">We at the European Central Bank fully support activities aimed at educating the public in financial and economic matters, and we are truly grateful for our partners’ contribution to achieving this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Many thanks to you all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, it is a pleasure for me to declare the exhibitions open.</span>
