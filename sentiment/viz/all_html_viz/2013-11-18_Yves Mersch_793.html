    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> On the road to a banking union: the way forward from the ECB’s perspective Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the 16th Euro Finance Week,Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, Last year, questions surrounding the banking union concerned fundamental concepts: How can we break the close links between countries and their banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">How can Europe’s fragmented financial market become better integrated again?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">While the objectives have remained the same, the public debate is now focusing more on the details of its implementation: What exactly will the balance sheet analysis look like?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And how will balance sheet assessments and stress tests be combined?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">How, precisely, will the ECB’s supervisors cooperate with their colleagues from the national supervisory authorities?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To the extent possible, I would like to begin today by answering some of these questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">I will also return to the key conceptual idea behind the banking union: the desire to establish uniform basic conditions for everyone all over Europe – conditions that will allow us to break the close links between countries and their banks and establish a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Specifically, I will address two questions: First, how is the fundamental idea behind the banking union reflected in the practical design of the single system of banking supervision?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.08,0)">Second, what else can we do to be faithful to that fundamental idea when banks cease to be viable and have to be wound up?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Fundamental idea Let us look, first of all, at the fundamental idea of ensuring uniform conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">If we are to have an effective European policy, there are decisions that have to be taken when it comes to implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We can have rules that go beyond mere harmonisation – very rigid rules that do not allow for any exceptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">That will mean that implementation decisions and instruments can continue to be taken and employed in a decentralised manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Or, alternatively, we can have a set of rules that contains a certain amount of room for discretion, one that takes account of the particular circumstances of individual cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That, however, will necessitate a central body to apply and implement those rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.61,0)">Exceptions must be objectively justified and cannot reflect the special interests of individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That is the only way to guarantee fair and consistent basic conditions across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The same is true of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Uniform conditions across Europe are aimed at establishing a single banking system to accompany the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is not a case of “more Europe” just for the sake of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This issue is addressed in the Treaty on European Union under the heading “subsidiarity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Decisions should only be taken at European level if action is more effective at that level than it would be at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.66,0)">Banking supervision What does this mean in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I will begin with the comprehensive assessment of the major banks of the euro area, which will be the focus of our new supervisory function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.12,0)">This may well concern many of the people here in this room.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This stocktaking exercise will comprise three elements: a risk assessment; the balance sheet assessment itself  ; and a stress test, which we will conduct in close cooperation with the European Banking Authority  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The risk assessment seeks to determine the riskiest asset classes and portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Factors such as refinancing and liquidity risks are examined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Building on the risk analysis, which has already begun, the balance sheet assessment itself is scheduled for the first half of next year, after the annual financial statements for 2013 have been drawn up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We will then look in detail at a selection of individual assets in the portfolios identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">We will also be looking, in that regard, for appropriate risk provisions at banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.52,0)">Essentially, it is a case of ensuring that there are no unknown risks hiding in banks’ balance sheets – for example as a result of inappropriate classification or valuation of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">That will give us an overview of whether the banks have a viable business model and where the biggest risks lie.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The balance sheet analysis itself will be conducted on the basis of uniform criteria in three stages: Portfolios will be selected on the basis of proposals by national supervisory authorities, which will be checked – and potentially amended – by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the course of this process, data will be checked for integrity and samples will be selected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Checks will then be carried out to determine the extent to which the valuation of the various assets and the classification of non-performing loans, collateral and provisions are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, the results will be compiled, collated and checked for consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">*** The banks of the euro area are certainly in a significantly better position than they were at the beginning of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">They have taken on €225 billion of fresh capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Governments have also made available additional capital injections totalling €275 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.88,0)">However, it may be that our investigations uncover shortfalls in terms of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.76,0)">The question, then, is how those shortfalls can be remedied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Initially, the banks concerned must use the market to cover their capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">However, in the event that individual banks are unable to raise the necessary capital, we also require robust alternative solutions to provide them with support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">While the balance sheet analysis is a static assessment of the current situation, the stress test seeks to offer a dynamic diagnosis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">We consider that conducting this test over a period of three years will be enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It should be sufficient, in that regard, for us to use a baseline scenario and one stress scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For the balance sheet assessment and the baseline scenario in the stress test, we foresee a core capital ratio   of at least 8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is in line with the requirements for 2014 in the implementation rules for Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A further issue, which we are currently discussing internally, concerns the question of how exposure to government bonds is to be valued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">While in order to comply with current legislation, a capital requirement of 0% is necessary for government bonds in the balance sheet analysis and a distinction has to be drawn between the banking book and the trading book, no decision has yet been taken on the requirement to be imposed for government bonds in the stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.78,0)">But solely by taking account of the market risk and the duration of the stress test combined with the maturities of the bonds, these assets inevitably will be stressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">Sometimes, the desire for full harmonisation and efforts to increase efficiency is limited by what is feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">For example, the EBA has produced a comprehensive common definition of “non-performing loans”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, in order for it to acquire legal force, this definition must first obtain the blessing of the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Although we use this definition, some banks will not be able to adjust their internal systems in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For that reason, a simplified variant is recognised as a minimum standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In any event, this still goes further than the current chaotic mass of national provisions and lays foundations in this regard at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.95,0)">The national supervisory authorities are responsible for making the necessary data available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Thus, we respect the principle of subsidiarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But they do so on the basis of very clear, uniform guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And the final quality controls and plausibility checks are conducted centrally at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This allows us to ensure, again, that the same conditions apply everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">*** However, this comprehensive assessment is merely preparation for the actual supervision, which we will begin in one year’s time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The same principles of uniform basic conditions and maximum use of national expertise will apply in the day-to-day work of Europe’s banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB will directly supervise the most important banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In order to ensure uniform conditions and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, we will be setting up joint supervisory teams.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This will enable us to harmonise supervision centrally and make use of the expertise of the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Here is an example to help explain what exactly “joint supervisory teams” means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">Each major bank will be supervised by a team of ECB supervisors and national supervisors, led by a central ECB coordinator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For each euro area country where this major bank is active, there will be a sub‑coordinator from the relevant national supervisory authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB coordinator, who has primary responsibility, will be tasked with carrying out the final quality check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.63,0)">He/she will also be responsible for reporting to the Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The fact that the ECB is directly supervising only the most important banks does not mean that all other institutions will remain subject to national requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All banks will be subject to the same rules and procedures when it comes to supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For example, we have drawn up harmonised templates for the reporting of data, and all on-site assessments are subject to the same rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Implementation remains the responsibility of the national supervisory authorities, but the ECB, as an established supranational institution, has the final say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Moreover, if the ECB considers it appropriate, it can take direct control of the supervision of a bank at any time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Both of these measures ensure that uniform criteria do not just exist on paper and are indeed applied in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In short, the single supervisory mechanism ensures a harmonised system of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At the same time, supervision of smaller institutions continues to be carried out on a decentralised basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This enables us to ensure that everyone is subject to the same conditions – fully in keeping with the further integration of Europe’s Single Market – while at the same time using the expertise of national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">This combination of national supervisory authorities and the ECB at a supranational level has at least three advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">First, harmonised technical standards reduce costs for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They also make it easier to compare banks in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, it is easier for national supervisory authorities to coordinate their actions when it comes to supervising banks that are active in more than one country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This makes the whole process significantly more efficient than the current colleges of supervisors, which will remain in place only for banks not covered by the new regime, and will be managed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Third, the ECB, as an independent supranational institution, will ensure that banking supervision ceases to be influenced by national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Instead, it will be conducted in the interests of Europe as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">However, supranational banking supervision alone will not be enough to overcome the fragmentation of Europe’s financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We also need suitably European solutions as regards the resolution of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Bank resolution There are very close links between the countries of Europe and their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">The credit default swap   spreads of banks and countries in the euro area are almost perfectly correlated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.22,0)">In the period between the beginning of 2010 and August of this year, the correlation coefficient between the average CDS spreads of large and complex banking groups in the euro area and the CDS spreads of their home countries was 0.9.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.31,0)">In the United States, on the other hand, it was just 0.2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These close links between countries and their banks are to be loosened using harmonised European rules on recovery and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.69,0)">Ultimately, this always comes down to the same question: Who pays when a bank gets into difficulty?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The planned directive harmonising the recovery and resolution of banks   provides for a clear hierarchy of liability in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.67,0)">It first falls to the banks’ owners, the shareholders, and then the creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.7,0)">The government can only get involved as a very last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.89,0)">In my view, however, these rules still allow too much room for manoeuvre at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And that brings me back to the fundamental concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A certain amount of room for manoeuvre within a harmonised set of rules can be entirely appropriate from the perspective of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In that case, though, those rules must be applied at a supranational level if the same conditions are indeed to apply everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">If decisions are taken by national decision-making bodies, the rules have to be so rigid that we end up with a uniform set of European conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.68,0)">Problems arise when the room for manoeuvre in the set of rules means that the envisaged involvement of shareholders and creditors is fully implemented only in countries that experience extreme financial difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.73,0)">If creditors believe that a bank from a country with relatively healthy public finances will be saved using taxpayers’ money in the event of an emergency, but that they themselves will have to pay in the case of banks from crisis countries, they are hardly likely to accept the same rates of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">That then leads, in turn, to increased fragmentation of the financial market, as banks with that kind of implicit government guarantee have significantly lower refinancing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">According to a study conducted by the OECD, this implicit guarantee allows the 17 largest German banks to save more than €20 billion in interest every year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Once the single bank resolution mechanism is in place, the planned resolution authority will apply the rules everywhere in a consistent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A certain degree of discretion will then certainly be justified in the interests of financial stability, as it will be accompanied by a central implementing authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That single resolution authority will be tasked with ensuring two things: first, that banks that have ceased to be viable are wound up at as little cost as possible; and second, that such costs are borne by those who caused them – not taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At this point, it is worth taking a quick look across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The US equivalent of this single resolution authority is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.86,0)">Since 2008 the FDIC has wound up around 490 banks, without causing major turmoil in the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">What is more, taxpayers have also been largely spared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">We in Europe can certainly learn from that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In 450 of those bank resolutions, the FDIC has used solutions such as mergers and acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">That approach has proved to be a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.32,0)">The fact that parts of struggling banks have been bought by other banks has meant that the costs caused by failing banks have largely been borne by the banking sector itself, rather than having to be shouldered by taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.47,0)">In Europe, on the other hand, governments have tended to intervene when banks have threatened to collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">That is one of the reasons why many of those countries have themselves ultimately ended up seeking help in the form of an EU/IMF programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The FDIC’s strategy, however, has helped to establish a better integrated and more robust banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.91,0)">Thus far, though, the idea of using cross-border acquisitions as a recovery strategy has been scarcely thinkable in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.35,0)">First, many banks are unwilling to acquire parts of other banks abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And second, such a strategy would require close coordination between national resolution authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.96,0)">This kind of coordination has proved difficult thus far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.08,0)">For that reason, I am also sceptical when it comes to the idea of a loose national network of resolution funds within the framework of a single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In my view, this is another area where a clear division of responsibilities and a European solution are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I therefore welcome the European Commission’s proposal for a single resolution mechanism, as it envisages a single European system, a single authority and a single fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We now need to turn this proposal into a functioning resolution mechanism by the target date of the beginning of 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">For we in Europe urgently require a full banking union with both fundamental elements: harmonised supervision and harmonised resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As the fund is to be financed by the banks, which will take some time to arrange, the primary question concerns the issue of transitional solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.83,0)">These, in turn, raise questions relating to the division of responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">Mistakes of the past at national level should not, in principle, be paid for by a joint fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">However, if there is no willingness to establish a stopgap measure, the credibility of this new architecture strengthening the single currency will be questioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion I would now like to conclude by summing up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">European policies will only be successful if we strike the right balance between room for discretion and centralisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, the principle of subsidiarity needs to be respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We are taking account of both in establishing the single banking supervision system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And the same should be true of the design of the single bank resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A few details still need to be agreed in that regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">I believe that this can function well, if we again remember the fundamental concepts, for I am sure that we are all now in agreement on those.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I believe that we all want a functioning European financial market, as well as banks that are properly supervised and can be wound up if necessary, without threatening financial stability or imposing unnecessarily large costs on taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Those principles should guide all further work on the design of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The objective, then, is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Now we just have to ensure that we achieve it in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">To conclude with the words of a famous Frankfurt poet: “A good many men have an idea of the goal, only they would like to reach it by sauntering along the labyrinthine ways.”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Schich, Sebastian and Lindh, Sofia  , “Implicit Guarantees for Bank Debt: Where Do We
