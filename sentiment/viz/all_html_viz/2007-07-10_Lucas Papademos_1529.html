Bonello will become members of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The two governors, together with the other 19 members of the ECB’s Governing Council, will thus participate fully in the decision-making concerning the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We are looking forward to benefit from their experience and expertise in our deliberations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Together, we will continue to analyse carefully the economic situation and outlook in the euro area and to do what is necessary to fulfil our mandate: to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole, to the benefit of soon 15 countries and 319 million Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I am sure that the people of Cyprus and Malta are looking forward to the changeover to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">They rightly expect that it will take place smoothly and that they are informed about their new banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">A smooth changeover to the euro will enhance their trust in the safety and integrity of their new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">To this end, the ECB, in close co-operation with the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta, have embarked in comprehensive euro information campaigns on the euro banknotes and coins in the two countries and will take all measures necessary to ensure a successful transition from the Cyprus and Maltese pounds to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Thankfully, we have by now accumulated certain experience with such changeover processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The euro changeover that took place early this year in Slovenia was a great success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Within a short period of time, Slovenians had completely accepted the new currency and integrated it in their daily life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">I am confident that the Cypriots and the Maltese will also benefit from the undeniable economic advantages of belonging to the single European currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As part of our experiences with previous changeovers to the euro, we know that we have to monitor carefully that prices are converted properly, and that the changeover should not be used as an occasion to raise prices in an unfounded and inordinate manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">It is therefore encouraging to see the positive outcome of several “price watching” movements in Cyprus and Malta, be they grass-roots or institutionally organised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And I have no doubt that the Cypriots and Maltese will be vigilant consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Entering monetary union is a historic undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Both countries have taken an irreversible step towards deeper economic integration within the euro area; they are now part of what can be called a “community with a common destiny”, or – it is maybe better to use the German term – a “Schicksalsgemeinschaft”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The stability and dynamism of the economies of Cyprus and Malta, and the welfare of their people, will be of importance to all of us who share the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Similarly, the growth and prosperity of the euro area as a whole will be a matter of significant interest also for the people of Cyprus and Malta.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Just like the members of a family, all members of the euro area should discuss together and take the best course of action, for the benefit of each and of all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Let me conclude by congratulating, once again, Cyprus and Malta for this great achievement, to become part of the euro area and to adopt “The EURO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">OUR money.” Κύπρο, καλωσόρισες!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Merħba, Malta!</span>
