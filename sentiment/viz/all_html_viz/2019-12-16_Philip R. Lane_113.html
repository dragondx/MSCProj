    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Dublin, 16 December 2019 Households and the transmission of monetary policy Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Central Bank of Ireland/ECB Conference on Household Finance and Consumption Introduction It is a special pleasure to speak at the Sixth Conference on Household Finance and Consumption, which is jointly organised this year by the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The engine behind this conference series is the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Network, which coordinates the Household Finance and Consumption Survey  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The HFCS gives us an insight into the distributions of assets, liabilities and incomes across euro area households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">It is very promising that many of you, together with other researchers, are using this dataset to improve our understanding of key features of economic behaviour in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In my remarks today, I wish to discuss the relevance of differences across households for macroeconomic outcomes and the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">Households differ across many dimensions: age, geography, employment, income, wealth, assets, and debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.01,0)">It follows that the impact of a macroeconomic shock or a shift in monetary policy will naturally vary across households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In turn, understanding how shocks and policies affect different types of households has the potential to improve our modelling of aggregate dynamics compared with the restrictive approach of imposing that aggregate household behaviour can be adequately represented by a single, representative household.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Moreover, the examination of household-level data is also important in measuring the distributional impact of macroeconomic shocks and macro-financial policy decisions, which can help inform wider policy discussions about income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Before turning to the microeconomic evidence, a natural starting point is to review the standard macroeconomic analysis of aggregate consumption dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition, households do not only consume, but also contribute to investment in the form of residential property – both house purchases and renovations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.37,0)">Consumption and total disposable income are deflated with the consumption deflator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">Latest observation: Q3 2019 for real consumption and Q2 2019 for the rest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For monetary policy analysis, an important question is the extent to which easier financial conditions have contributed to these dynamics through a variety of direct and indirect channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A comprehensive analysis of this question requires a microeconomic approach, which takes into account relevant differences across households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Household-level data, such as those available from the HFCS, are essential for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These data highlight some quantitatively-important dimensions of heterogeneity in the euro area, which can be grouped into two broad categories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.69,0)">First, the level and volatility of income varies across households according to socio-economic characteristics such as education, age and occupation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.97,0)">Households with different income sources  , different skill levels, or different labour supply elasticities will respond differently to macroeconomic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.9,0)">In turn, wages vary strongly with characteristics such as age and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Such differences not only matter for understanding how different types of households react differently to economic shocks: evidence suggests that changes in the composition of the workforce can help explaining euro area wage growth at the aggregate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Estimates for the largest four euro area countries indicate that the increase in income after an expansionary monetary policy shock is particularly large for households in the lowest income quintile  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.66,0)">The explanation is that low-income households are substantially more likely to be unemployed at any point in time: it follows that this group is more likely to benefit from the employment creation triggered by a monetary expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Similarly, the elasticity of labour income in relation to changes in aggregate GDP growth is significantly higher for workers in lower-income households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.16,0)">Percentages in brackets indicate the share of net borrowers and net savers in the total household population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Analogously, only homeowners will benefit from any increase in house prices induced by a monetary policy easing and those with mortgages will benefit disproportionately due to the impact of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.89,0)">Conversely,   The decline was especially marked for homeowners with mortgages, for whom it amounted to as much as around 20 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Recent ECB research suggests that the most important dimension of heterogeneity is related to employment status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.47,0)">Following an easing of monetary policy conditions, there are disproportionate increases in income in the lower part of the income distribution, which results in a decline in measured income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">By contrast, since a majority of households are homeowners, an increase in house prices due to a looser monetary policy has a relatively even impact of house prices across the wealth distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At the same time, it is worth keeping in mind that the degree of home ownership can vary considerably across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The more concentrated ownership of equities and bonds among households means that this component of the wealth distribution varies with the monetary stance, even while recalling that many households have indirect financial holdings through pension funds and other types of investment vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From a broader perspective, we should also bear in mind that the contribution of monetary policy to changes in inequality is small, compared with the role of fiscal policy   and structural economic trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">Differences across households also matter for the relation between aggregate income and aggregate consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.04,0)">In particular, if an increase in aggregate income is not uniform across households, the overall consumption response will depend on the marginal propensity to consume that is, the fraction of an additional euro received that is spent on consumption – of the different household types.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">A rich empirical literature has uncovered considerable heterogeneity in marginal propensity to consume across household types.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.11,0)">In particular, this literature finds that the spending decisions of households owning few liquid assets are much more sensitive to shocks than the spending decisions of households that own sufficient liquid buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.27,0)">Similarly, highly-indebted households tend to have a higher propensity to consume than savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Quantifying the implications for the transmission of monetary policy of heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume requires detailed institutional and socio-economic information on households at higher frequency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This type of information is available in certain countries and it is encouraging that researchers are starting to make use of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The results indicate that this heterogeneity does play a role in shaping the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Beyond the intertemporal substitution channel, other channels have been highlighted by the expanding literature on heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian   models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">These include: a “cash-flow” channel, through which the decline in debt service for debtors means that they have more of their income available for spending; an “income” channel, whereby higher consumption expenditure results from the increase in employment and wages; and a “wealth” channel, such that the increase in asset valuations generates more spending through wealth effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Some initial estimates of the quantitative impact of all these channels are also available for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.19,0)">They are reported in     The standard intertemporal substitution effect  , the cash-flow effect, the income effect and the housing wealth effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.48,0)">The size of these effects varies depending on households’ wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.95,0)">Euro area in this chart refers to France, Germany, Italy and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.18,0)">This classification is relevant, since it has been argued that the two groups of households with limited financial assets are more constrained in their ability to smooth consumption over time and tend to respond more strongly to temporary changes in income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.35,0)">In addition, the composition of wealth of the different groups varies: while homeowners with limited financial assets tend to have a mortgage  , the homeowners with substantial financial assets often experience lower returns on interest-rate-bearing assets if the policy rate declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.94,0)">It makes up only about a third of the total impact on aggregate consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Second, the cash-flow channel is particularly strong for homeowners with limited financial assets, who tend to have large mortgages, often with adjustable rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Third, spending is substantially stimulated via the income channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This channel is heavily skewed towards lower-income households, who also tend to benefit disproportionately from a stronger labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Fourth, the strongest asset price effect occurs through the increases in house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This effect turns out to be quite large for highly leveraged homeowners, since their consumption is more sensitive to house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Overall, the spending of the lower-income cohort and the cohort of homeowners with only limited financial assets is much more strongly stimulated by monetary policy easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">A 100 basis point cut in interest rates increases consumption of these groups by almost 1.0 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, while consumption of the financially-unconstrained group increases only by 0.4 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">These estimates suggest that the standard intertemporal substitution channel substantially contributes to the spending decision of many households, but the other three channels, which have traditionally been neglected, are decisive for the consumption choice of the lower-income cohort and highly-leveraged homeowners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These three channels contribute about two thirds of the total response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy shift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It follows that household heterogeneity can help to explain how the effects of monetary policy can be relatively large, due to the larger consumption response of the hand-to-mouth group, even if the intertemporal substitution channel is weaker than in the representative agent framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">To summarise, it is important to account for heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy, but this is not a simple exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.49,0)">Comparisons between “winners and losers” based on a single channel, or a specific factor, are necessarily incomplete and likely to prove misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Attention to variation across households and its relation to monetary policy is welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It helps us to make progress in understanding the key features of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">It is also very promising that the economics profession is finding ways to incorporate relevant dimensions of household heterogeneity in our models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.94,0)">This flourishing field recognises that monetary transmission is more complicated and dependent on many institutional features than suggested by the traditional representative-agent model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Further advances will require more data and more analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">An essential source to estimate these effects in the euro area is the HFCS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">One avenue is to make use of the administrative data available in other datasets   to complement and improve the information collected via household surveys.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">I very much applaud this effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Another important element is to better understand how consumers form expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">To this end the ECB is working on establishing a Consumer Expectations Survey, which we hope will provide a useful basis to deepen our understanding of consumer behaviour at a granular level and the extent to which this matters for macroeconomic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">I am grateful to Maarten Dossche, Jirka
