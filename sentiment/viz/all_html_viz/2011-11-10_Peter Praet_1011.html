    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)"> The   role of central banks in financial stability policies Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th Annual Internal Banking Conference, organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the European Central Bank, Chicago, 10 November 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen,   More than four years have passed since the onset of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.2,0)">Over these years, central banking functions have been stretched to the limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.91,0)">Recent developments demonstrate how fragile our financial system remains, not only because of debt legacy but more worrisome because of its mere design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.08,0)">The public debt crisis in a number of advanced economies is also raising fundamental questions about the role of public debt instruments in our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.46,0)">Looking backwards, one can say that disciplining mechanisms in debt markets have clearly failed, often as a result of mutually reinforcing market and government failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.45,0)">Too much debt in the public sector is the symptom of both ineffective public governance and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.74,0)">Budget rules, such as the no-bail-out provision of the Maastricht Treaty, didn’t contain the accumulation of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.71,0)">In the banking sector, the disciplining role of sight-deposits has proven to be time-inconsistent in the presence of the negative externalities that the failure of a large institution would create.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Although the role of monetary policy in the build up of the crisis is still debated, it does influence in an important way the price of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.28,0)">Lack of attention and preparedness to tail-events has been particularly striking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.02,0)">While central banks have always paid attention to the possibility of extreme events in payments and post-trade infrastructures, too little efforts have been devoted to the prevention of the conditions under which emergency liquidity assistance would be provided to the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.37,0)">Other authorities were concerned, such as supervisors at the micro-level and ministries of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The necessity of constructive “ambiguity” was also invoked to keep a low profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Achieving and preserving financial stability has now become a key policy objective in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Building up separate macroprudential policy functions is considered one of the main elements of the wide ranging policy reforms in pursuit of this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The idea is to entrust the authority in charge of macroprudential policy with the task of monitoring, identifying and mitigating systemic risks as they emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Macroprudential policy, by taking a system-wide perspective, thereby complements microprudential policy which is mainly oriented towards ensuring the health of individual institutions or markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">But the way to organise the macroprudential function is still work in progress in particular on the role of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are different views on how to design such a framework and how they should relate to central banks, their governance structures and their monetary policy strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.58,0)">This is essentially related not only to the difficulty to define financial stability in an operational way  , but also to the number of authorities concerned   and to the variety of possible tools often assigned to several objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Central banks should undoubtedly assume important roles in macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Central banks bring in essential expertise in analysing financial systems from an aggregate perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">They also have proper incentives to mitigate systemic risk ex ante since central banks typically have to deal with the fallout from financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Last but not least, involving central banks in macroprudential policy should foster effective coordination between monetary policy and financial stability policies in a manner that preserves their autonomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Policy coordination is likely to become important in light of the strong mutual interdependencies between the financial and the real sectors and thereby between both policy functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will come back to policy coordination later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A wide range of different approaches exist to institutionalise central banks’ role in the new financial stability frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The different approaches taken largely respond to country-specific circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.64,0)">A “one size fits all” approach simply doesn’t exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is also in the European Union where individual countries have adopted different approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the level of the European Union as a whole, a new financial supervisory architecture became operational at the beginning of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It includes three new European supervisory authorities   for banking, insurance and securities markets – which aim to strengthen micro-prudential supervision – and the European Systemic Risk Board   responsible for macroprudential oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ECB ensures the Secretariat function for the ESRB - without prejudice to the principle of central bank independence -, and is also in charge of providing analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support to this new EU body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Moreover, central bankers hold the majority in the ESRB’s decision-making body, the General Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The main tasks of the ESRB are to monitor and assess systemic risk and to issue warnings and, where necessary, recommendations to the relevant policy-makers which are not legally binding but depend on the principle of “comply or explain”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, the ECB’s contribution to achieving and maintaining financial stability does not rely exclusively on its responsibilities for an effective functioning of the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.27,0)">Obviously, the way the ECB conducts monetary policy also impacts on financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some people call for vast changes in central banks’ institutional setup and their monetary policy strategies with a view to pursue price stability and financial stability as coequal objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my view, by contrast, major changes in the institutional and strategic framework of monetary policy are not necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.22,0)">But business as usual in central banking will not do it either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Business as usual would imply adhering to what has become known as the “Jackson Hole consensus”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">According to this pre-crisis consensus view, central banks should only respond to asset prices and financial imbalances to the extent that they affect the shorter term inflation forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">If financial imbalances still emerged, central banks should follow a “mop up” or “cleaning” strategy after the burst of the bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Maintaining price stability is simply the best central banks could do to contribute to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">This view implied a strict separation between monetary policy and financial stability policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Central banks had been well aware of the importance of financial stability for the smooth conduct of monetary policy and of their varied responsibilities in ensuring financial stability on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.95,0)">Yet, the importance of the possible implications of financial imbalances were underestimated and not systematically integrated in the analytical apparatus supporting monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.32,0)">This flaw in the intellectual underpinning misled central banks to downplay their financial stability functions and supported the general view that monetary and microprudential policy can be conducted separately, with monetary policy instruments geared towards achieving macroeconomic stability, and financial regulation and supervision aimed at preserving financial stability in the spirit of Tinbergen’s policy assignment rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.35,0)">However, it has become clear by now that this strictly dichotomous view is flawed since monetary policy and financial stability policy are intrinsically linked to each other, given the powerful interactions between financial and economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.52,0)">As the recent crisis forcefully demonstrated, the previous mainly microprudential orientation of financial regulation and supervision proved unable to curb the tendency of the ever more complex and opaque financial system to generate excessive amounts of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.99,0)">The unravelling of the associated financial imbalances brought about the biggest financial and economic disaster since WWII which, in turn, severely impacted on the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.52,0)">As the monetary policy transmission mechanisms were affected, central banks had to take unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.5,0)">The crisis also taught us that “cleaning” rather than “leaning” against financial imbalances can simply become too costly to be ignored ex ante.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In addition, we also learned not to underestimate the moral hazard associated with the asymmetry in the previous consensus view of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">In the light of the obvious breakdown of the Jackson Hole consensus, the view has become more popular that under certain circumstances, central banks may be well advised to actively lean against the emergence of financial imbalances in order to mitigate systemic risk and the associated longer term risks to price stability and economic welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">At the ECB, we have always emphasised one tool which helps us maintain a medium to long-run orientation: the “monetary analysis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The monetary analysis is one element of the ECB’s two-pillar framework – in addition to the economic analysis - for the regular assessment of risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But we have always foreseen that monitoring monetary and credit developments is also part of an overall framework for addressing asset price misalignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The analysis of low-frequency trends in money and credit developments has always been associated with the emergence of imbalances, because it allows us to assess risks to price stability well beyond the typical shorter term forecast horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This notwithstanding, for what concerns the monetary policy strategy, significant efforts are still to be undertaken in building up an appropriate analytical framework linking the various sources of systemic risk to economic outcomes over long policy horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This may robustify the ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy to better cope with risks of highly uncertain, low probability but very costly events such as financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A better understanding of the transmission channels that exist between the financial and the real sectors is therefore of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">While some headway has been made in studying non-conventional transmissions channels such as the risk-taking channel, other issues still remain work in progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.87,0)">For example what is the influence of interest rates on risk tolerance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.93,0)">What is the interrelation between funding and market liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">What are the determinants of the leverage cycle, and which role is played by financial innovation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.13,0)">Given the complexity of the issues involved one has to admit that the development of an operational framework linking monetary policy to the various forms of systemic risk is extremely complicated and poses severe intellectual challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.68,0)">Financial stability risks may also arise from excessive monetary policy activism geared toward buying insurance against adverse macroeconomic and/or financial stability conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.31,0)">For instance, central banks might threaten future economic and financial stability if they keep policy rates too low for too long in the aftermath of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.62,0)">In the context of the present crisis, the risk of missing the right time to exit from unconventional monetary policy measures offers a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the light of these insights, it should be clear that monetary policy cannot do it alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Financial stability should mainly be pursued by microprudential and macroprudential policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Also, in order to achieve price and financial stability a pairing of appropriate policies by all relevant authorities is indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">One avenue might be to give an agent the specific mandate to assess the financial stability impact of regulatory and tax changes when relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.97,0)">However, policy coordination is in general not easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.87,0)">Coordination might be impaired by problems of time inconsistency when the objective functions of the authorities involved may differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.94,0)">For instance, governments may succumb to the temptation to respond to electoral pressures or lobbying activities from the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.02,0)">A macroprudential authority might also be endowed with too much discretion in its instrument setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.87,0)">These potential policy failures may therefore favour a more rules-based approach towards the macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This applies both to policy tools addressing the time dimension of financial stability   and tools relating to the cross-section dimension  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.86,0)">As the financial system is highly adaptive one has to be aware that only controlling the time dimension of financial stability is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For example, similar rates of asset price inflation in the real estate markets may not imply similar risks to financial stability even when occurring at similar points in the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A proper assessment of systemic risk always requires a thorough analysis of borrower and lender fragilities as well as of the whole intermediation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.82,0)">Policy coordination is also particularly challenging in a currency union when credit cycles   are not synchronized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Moreover, monetary integration in the European Monetary Union has advanced at a much higher pace than the integration of financial stability and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">An important step forward was allowing the ESRB to make country-specific recommendations but a further strengthening of its powers might still be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">To conclude, challenges are immense both on the technical side as well as on the governance side to safeguard financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In essence, the task consists in reinforcing disciplining mechanisms in private and public debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">There is a need to act in a number of areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Central banks have an important role to play as coordinator/ facilitator/ initiator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They also have the proper incentives to do so in order not to overburden monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">I would like to thank Manfred Kremer and Oreste Tristani for their contributions to the preparation of
