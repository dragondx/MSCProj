    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)"> Building on the achievements of post-crisis reforms Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the second annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you to the second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.48,0)">The conference coincides with the tenth anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis in the summer of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.13,0)">The crisis shook the European Union to the core, and required substantial policy actions to stabilise the economy and the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">With a return to stability having been achieved, it is important that we take time to reflect on what we have learnt, what we have achieved over the past ten years, and where we need to do further work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The crisis taught us that individual banks and the banking system as a whole needed to be more resilient than they were pre-crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">As a result, many reforms have been put in place in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Our banking regulation and supervision have become stricter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Moreover, the European regulatory framework now places greater emphasis on identifying and addressing system-wide risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This includes the establishment of the ESRB and the creation of macroprudential instruments assigned to public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A more resilient post-crisis banking sector In the banking sector, significant efforts have been made in recent years to increase resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the euro area, for example, the average Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions rose from 7% in 2008 to 13.5% by end-2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">And banks are required to set up solid governance structures and prudent risk management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Moreover, resilience is now tested more rigorously in a forward-looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The EU-wide stress tests coordinated by the European Banking Authority   have become an important tool for quantifying banks’ capital needs, with a view to ensuring that they would be able to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers even during a severe recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">,   Post-crisis prudential rules have also provided public authorities with macroprudential tools to address systemic risks in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">And the understanding of how to calibrate and implement these tools has advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">For example, all Member States now have a countercyclical capital buffer framework that is fully operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Four Member States have announced a non-zero buffer rate for domestic exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Yet despite these steps forward, it is important to remain vigilant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One important aspect concerns the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.11,0)">Financial and business cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances can grow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.7,0)">This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">Indeed, the ESRB last year identified medium-term vulnerabilities in some countries’ residential real estate sectors – precisely the type of situation that macroprudential policies are designed to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It published country-specific warnings to eight Member States in November 2016, in accordance with its mandate to identify and flag significant systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">But beyond increasing the resilience of the banking sector, there is also a need to address the remaining legacies of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Two important aspects are the resolution of already impaired assets, and better accounting for impaired assets for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.84,0)">Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans   on European banks’ balance sheets remains high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.84,0)">At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around €1 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.41,0)">Banks’ profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.43,0)">The outstanding stock of NPLs is a consequence of cyclical and structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.03,0)">First, the severe recession resulting from the global financial crisis led to a deterioration of the quality of banks’ loan books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The current economic expansion should therefore help to improve the asset quality of European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.89,0)">At the same time, structural weaknesses still persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">These include inadequate internal governance structures in banks, ineffective and costly debt recovery procedures in some Member States and misaligned incentives that prevent a quick resolution of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To this end, the ESRB has proposed  a series of measures to complement those already being taken at EU and euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In the short term, the ESRB’s proposals focus on strengthening banks’ NPL management, including their prudent measurement and the valuation of the associated collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Policymakers could aid this process by developing blueprints for asset management companies, accompanied by harmonised data templates across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Measures should also concentrate on insolvency regimes, debt recovery and servicing capacities with a view to improving recovery rates from NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Over a longer horizon, secondary markets’ trading platforms should be further developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">And banks also need to be given adequate incentives, in particular in relation to accounting for impaired assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">From 1 January 2018 onwards, a new accounting standard for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, known as IFRS 9 , becomes mandatory in EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the request of the European Parliament, the ESRB has recently published a report on the financial stability implications of IFRS 9,  which concludes that it is a major improvement, particularly regarding accounting for NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The most important change introduced by IFRS 9 is the shift from an incurred loss approach to an expected credit loss approach for measuring impairment allowances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This means that banks will have to recognise impairments earlier, curtailing excessive forbearance towards NPLs and helping ensure that banking sector repair takes place in a timelier and more comprehensive manner in future downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A recent impact assessment, based on a sample of 54 banks across 20 Member States published by the European Banking Authority, suggests that the introduction of IFRS 9 would lead to an increase of provisions of about 13% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.35,0)">The expected credit loss approach also means that banks will have to react in their accounting to new and forward-looking information as it is received.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.78,0)">This means that impairment allowances may increase suddenly and significantly when economic conditions deteriorate, which could have certain pro-cyclical effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ESRB report considers a number of policies that could address such effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">For example, stress testing could be used as a means to gauge the variation in impairment allowances associated with adverse scenarios, in order to ensure that sufficient capital buffers are in place and to allow for remedial policy action if required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">If banks can withstand a hypothetical adverse scenario, they would likely be able to cope with the early recognition of expected credit losses under a real downturn, as required by IFRS Identifying and addressing risks beyond the banking sector Given the bank-based nature of the European economy, the state of the banking sector is central to our assessment of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the financial system is constantly evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Since 2008, the assets of the non-bank financial sector in the euro area have roughly doubled and are now slightly larger than those of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The path to growth set out in the European Commission’s Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union   means that the non-bank financial sector is likely to play an increasingly important role in financing the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This evolution offers many opportunities: it would provide new sources of funding for business, and it would help increase options for investors and savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Yet, as financial intermediation shifts from banks to non-banks, existing risks may migrate and new risks may emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">It is important, then, to identify such risks and to develop tools to mitigate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Take, for example, the issue of interconnectedness between different parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Interconnectedness – be that through direct exposures or indirectly via common or correlated asset holdings – is a natural feature of an integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.21,0)">But during times of financial stress, interconnectedness transmits and potentially amplifies shocks, and can lead to contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Full visibility is of the essence here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this regard, the second EU Shadow Banking Monitor, published by the ESRB earlier this year,  analyses a unique data set collected by the EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">The data show that exposures of EU banks to shadow banking entities amount to over €1 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Focusing on a more granular subset of these exposures, the analysis finds that 60% of EU banks’ exposures to shadow banking entities are to entities domiciled outside the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">These findings highlight the global and cross-border interconnectedness of the banking and shadow banking systems and the need for international cooperation in monitoring and addressing cross-sectoral risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.94,0)">Unilateral actions and isolated national attempts are predisposed to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">When moving from identifying to addressing risks in the financial system, a number of elements need to work in tandem: good regulation and supervision make individual firms safer; recovery and resolution regimes provide legal certainty when a firm gets into trouble and they ensure that failure is orderly; and macroprudential policy looks beyond individual institutions and deploys tools to target systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">A recovery and resolution regime is particularly important for central counterparties  , which have become critical hubs in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Legislation in this area is progressing, and the ESRB continues to identify areas of refinement to better address macroprudential considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">This includes the need for cooperation and coordination between resolution authorities for banks and CCPs, as distress of a CCP would typically be triggered by distress in one or more banks that are clearing members of the CCP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Creating a harmonised recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector across the EU is also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.54,0)">Ordinary insolvency procedures may not always be consistent with policy holder protection and financial stability objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.58,0)">This means that they may not suffice to manage the failure of a large insurer or the simultaneous failure of multiple insurers in an orderly fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">For example, Romania developed a comprehensive recovery and resolution framework of this kind following difficulties faced by two large insurers in 2014 and 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">And the Netherlands and France are in the process of developing such frameworks after experiencing the near-failure of some financial conglomerates during the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Addressing systemic risks requires macroprudential tools that public authorities can use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Reflecting this, the ESRB recently noted that there is a need to establish a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit beyond banking, which to date is lacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Of course, specific tools still need to be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ESRB has done preliminary work assessing what those tools might be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One example is the macroprudential use of margins and haircuts, on which I updated the European Parliament earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">,   Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">At the same time, work remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I hope that when you return to your institutions, this conference will have strengthened your resolve to address the challenges in banking and beyond that are discussed here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">On that note, I am pleased to open this second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For example, the most recent stress tests by the European Banking Authority in 2016 included 51 banks from 15 EU and EEA countries, covering around 70% of banking assets in each jurisdiction and across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The ESRB has contributed a macroprudential perspective to these stress tests and developed surveys to consider feedback loops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">, S.
