    <span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)"> Euro 2002 Information Campaign the EURO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">OUR money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank at the conference hosted by Suomen Pankki   on 17 September 2001 in Helsinki at the Marina Congress Centre Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Before I proceed with my speech, I would like to express my sincere condolences and those of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank to all those whose lives were touched by last week's terrorist attacks in the United States of America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.41,0)">The attacks were so horrific – and tragic – that we are talking about the world being a different place now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">That may be so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But life – and that includes business life – has to, and will, go on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">I would like to emphasise that the Eurosystem stands ready to support the normal functioning of markets and relevant operational systems if the need arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The Governing Council reaffirmed its support at its meeting last Thursday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this context, the Eurosystem conducted liquidity-providing fine tuning operations last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The ECB also agreed last week on a swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve System to facilitate the functioning of the financial markets and to provide liquidity in dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Eurosystem is co-ordinating its activity with the Federal Reserve of the United States and the world's other major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.85,0)">Furthermore, as a mark of respect, the European Union held a day of mourning last Friday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.51,0)">And as a gesture of solidarity, we withdrew all TV commercials and print advertisements by the Euro 2002 Information Campaign from the media on that day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me now turn to the subject of this conference, the Euro 2002 Information Campaign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.6,0)">The conference is being hosted by Suomen Pankki and it is one of the last ones in the campaign being conducted by the European Central Bank   and the twelve national central banks of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Tomorrow, the Banca d'Italia, and in one month's time, the Bank of Greece will conclude this series of conferences, which has brought together more than 5,000 key actors in the euro cash changeover process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">They have benefited from the exchange of views and information, for they have been able to enhance their own preparations for the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Moreover, the media attending these conferences have made the public more aware of the impending introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">My colleagues on the Executive Board and myself have been pleased to actively contribute to these conferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In just over 100 days, the EURO.OUR money, will be in our pockets, and will finally become an everyday reality for all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In just over 100 days, we will be able to travel from one euro area country to another, from Helsinki to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, without having to change our money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We will be able to compare prices for products and services much more easily; it's an enormous step that will give a major boost to competition and price transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In just over 100 days, companies and organisations will be able to expand their markets and pursue their activities without having the cost and inconvenience of dealing with several currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In just over 100 days, Europeans will feel at home in many parts of Europe because, for the very first time, they will share the same banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.81,0)">The general public sometimes does not realise that the euro has existed as a currency since 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro is already OUR money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Whenever we buy something with current national banknotes of the euro area, we are in fact already paying in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The introduction of the banknotes and coins represents an unprecedented logistical challenge for all parties involved; almost 15 billion banknotes and around 50 billion coins are being produced and the major part will be distributed, first to the banking sector and then to the retail sector before reaching the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">These two steps, known respectively as frontloading and sub-frontloading, started on 1 September and entail a gradual supply of euro banknotes and coins to different sectors of the economy in order to make the process as smooth as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Of course, there will be a considerable demand for euro banknotes from outside the euro area and therefore we have adopted general principles and a guideline for the frontloading of euro banknotes to non-euro area residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Mr. Antti Heinonen, Director Banknotes at the ECB, will review the production and distribution of the euro banknotes in more detail later this afternoon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">On 30 August, I unveiled the seven euro banknotes and their security features at a press conference in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The banknotes show windows, gateways and bridges – symbols of openness and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">They reflect Europe's artistic and architectural heritage and, at the same time, will help to promote a feeling of solidarity, to bring about new opportunities and to strengthen ties and transactions between the nations of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But transactions need to be trustworthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The new banknotes include state-of-the-art security features, which will make the euro one of the world's safest currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">These features will provide reassurance: they will enable both the public and professional cash handlers to check the banknotes quickly and easily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The needs of blind and partially sighted people have also been carefully considered: they will be able to identify the banknotes with confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.34,0)">The seven euro banknotes differ in size and colour, and the value of the banknote is printed in large, bold numbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This will make it easier for all of us to recognise the banknotes when they enter into circulation on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, this will be a watershed in Europe's history; it will be a unique event that requires our fullest support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">It is crucial that we, the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area, do our utmost to ensure that euro banknotes and coins are well received by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A rapid acceptance will very much depend on how well we communicate about OUR money with "our" public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The more effectively we communicate, the more we will convince Europeans that Europe is not some abstract and remote idea, but an immediate and dynamic reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The quality of the information we provide will determine how well the public copes with the cash changeover and gets used to denominations that may differ from national ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That's why the Governing Council of the ECB has launched an information campaign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">We have the support of Publicis, a communication agency which we selected for this historic task, and the national central banks of the euro area, which are implementing the information campaign and also supplementing it with their own euro-related communications at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Our campaign covers the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Moreover, it is aimed not only at people inside the euro area, but also at those outside it, such as tourists, travellers as well as the citizens of countries where the predecessor currencies to the euro are used widely as parallel currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In order to reach such a broad public, the information campaign uses various groups and institutions as partners or "multipliers".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They include banks, retailers, educational institutions, the tourism industry and the media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I would like to highlight the key role these partners have played and are still playing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Here in Finland and in the rest of Europe partners in the Euro 2002 Information Campaign from both the public and private sectors are contributing to this important communication effort by conveying information on euro banknotes and coins to their staff, customers and other target groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">We have over 2,600 organisations which have signed a partnership agreement with the ECB and the 12 national central banks of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">I would also like to stress that the media are receiving special attention in the campaign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">For them, we have produced a total of six media kits, each marking a specific milestone in the countdown to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">These have been, and will be, distributed to more than 3000 media companies in the euro area in the course of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The media kit marking today's milestone, is E -100  , or 100 days to go, and focuses on the final visual appearance of the euro banknotes and their security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Furthermore, we are paying particular attention in the campaign to vulnerable groups who need and will receive tailor-made information and training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">We have now reached the crucial period in terms of communication on the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Our mass media campaign, with TV and print adverts across the euro area and beyond, has just been launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.28,0)">The communication offensive will continue into the first weeks of 2002, when the changeover will be taking place and people will have the euro banknotes and coins in their hands and pockets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">They will then be more receptive to messages about the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In Finland, you can watch our TV commercials for the very first time today, and see our print adverts as from 3 October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The creative concept here focuses on the positive spirit which comes from being part of a broad community with a single currency, and is reflected in the slogan, the EURO.OUR money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Because we cannot afford to miss a single opportunity to inform three hundred million Europeans, two hundred million public information leaflets, in 11 languages, have been produced, enough for every household in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The leaflet is entitled Getting ready for the euro, and shows the euro banknotes, with details of the security features and of the changeover plan for each country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The leaflet is tailored to the needs and circumstances of each country and will be distributed by the national central banks through a variety of channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">I would also like to mention our initiative to help the children of the euro area learn about euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Seven million posters, each including a competition designed to raise awareness of the euro, will soon be sent to primary schools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The competition, which runs until mid-November, must be one of the largest ever held for children aged between 8 and 12 in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The lucky winners, our 24 "euro superstars", two from each euro area country, will receive their prizes at an event that will take place in Frankfurt on 31 December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Finally, let me turn to the ECB itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.8,0)">It is still a young central bank just 3 years old.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Its mandate is to guarantee price stability by conducting a single monetary policy for the 12 countries and 300 million people in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.65,0)">The public perception of an institution sometimes differs sharply from, and even oversimplifies, the complex reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.66,0)">This is also the fate of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.63,0)">Its tasks are indeed complex, involving monetary policy decisions and operations, statistics, payment systems, legal issues, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">However, its primary objective as laid down in the Treaty of the European Communities is very clear: price stability in the euro area, in other words, safeguarding the value of the euro banknotes and coins and keeping inflation under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Keeping control of inflation was and remains our main focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB has so far fulfilled its mandate successfully and aims to do so in the future for the benefit of Europe's citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of course, the impact of the cash changeover on price developments in the coming months needs to be carefully monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures stemming from the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Still, I would like to appeal to all economic operators, including governments, to strictly apply the rounding rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.17,0)">We cannot afford such a momentous event to be overshadowed by unjustified price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.1,0)">Any increases would undermine confidence in the euro and damage the credibility of those abusing the cash changeover in such a way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The ECB is also asking the public to keep a close eye on prices during the changeover period and is encouraging consumers and various organisations to follow up any – may I say – abuse of the occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">I am repeating myself, but it is important to be aware that on 1 January 2002 we are not introducing the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The euro has been OUR money since 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">What we are doing is introducing the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Then, for the very first time, twelve countries in Europe will be sharing one currency: the EURO.OUR money .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">Or, as you say in Finnish, EURO YHTEINEN RAHAMME</span>
