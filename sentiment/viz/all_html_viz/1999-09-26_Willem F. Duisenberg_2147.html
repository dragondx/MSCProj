    <span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)"> The past and future of European integration: a central banker's perspective The 1999 Per Jacobsson Lecture by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on 26 September in Washington D.C. Introduction I feel honoured to have been invited to give this year's prestigious Per Jacobsson lecture before such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The euro was launched successfully almost nine months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">This was a historic moment, with 11 countries voluntarily relinquishing sovereignty over monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Technically the changeover proceeded remarkably smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Former national money markets were rapidly integrated, in no small measure due to the smooth functioning of TARGET, the new European payment system which, generally speaking, worked well from the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The euro is traded on all international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Moreover, the euro has been introduced in a climate of prevailing price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This is the result of a process of convergence in which there has been a general decrease in European inflation rates over recent years, from - in the case of some countries - significantly higher levels in previous years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">The introduction of the euro is neither an isolated nor a purely economic event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">It is another, yet very important, step in the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">The process began more than half a century ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">The creation of the euro is not the end of that process either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.52,0)">Today, I should like to briefly look back, but mainly look ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">My perspective is that of a central banker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The nature of this perspective will become clear in the course of my lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Dealing with European integration and with the new European single currency is particularly appropriate in the context of this lecture series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Per Jacobsson has spent his professional career pursuing sound money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This is the very same challenge that faces us: making the euro a sound - that is to say stable - currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The history of European integration Let me first deal briefly with the history of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This process has been strongly driven by political motives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">The main underlying aim was to avoid a recurrence in the future of the wars which devastated 20th century Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">To that end, central Europe's largest country, Germany, should be firmly embedded in a European structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As Thomas Mann has aptly put it: "A European Germany, rather than a German Europe".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.21,0)">Without a common European framework, tensions could arise again between Germany and other countries, France in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">European integration should serve the objective of creating a peaceful, stable and prosperous Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The unification of Germany almost a decade ago, and the removal of the iron curtain have placed Germany even further, as it were, in the heart of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">These fundamental changes make clear that the motives for European integration are no less valid today than 50 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The main vehicle for European integration has been economic integration, via the coal and steel industry, from establishing a customs union, the European Monetary System, to the Single Market programme and the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.4,0)">"Trade, do not fight" or perhaps better "Trade and you will not fight" was the basic philosophy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">Given this background, it is striking that economists all too often assess the costs and benefits of European integration in purely economic terms and in a rather static context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.87,0)">This is clearly too narrow an approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Nonetheless, the economics of European integration are important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The political objectives can only be met if economic integration is successful and placed on a sound economic footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is also where the role of the central banker comes in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.5,0)">He or she should not and does not decide on the steps to be taken in the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That is in the realm of politics and is also market-driven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The central banker advises and points out the conditions which have to be met for certain steps to be taken safely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.29,0)">The reverse is also true: the central banker and central banks are for their part influenced by the integration process, and the greater the level of integration in the monetary field, the greater the impact upon them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.8,0)">The central bank and the central banker are operating in an environment, which is affected by the ongoing integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This has to be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, the question arises as to whether a single monetary policy ultimately calls for further integration in other areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In retrospect, it can be concluded that, thus far, the European integration process has, on balance, been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In our part of Europe we have experienced peace since the process was initiated and we have seen a continuous growth in earnings and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The further process of gradual integration has now culminated in the emergence of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There is no room, however, for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.05,0)">Looking back, let me also draw some more specific conclusions: The integration process has been marked by ups and downs, often in step with the course of the business cycle or in connection with major shocks, such as German unification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.39,0)">The road has been long and winding, sometimes bumpy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Long ago European integration reached the point of no return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There is no alternative but to continue down the path of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Economic integration has generated its own dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is no longer completely dependent on political initiatives to propel it forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Overall, however, the political component of the European integration process is still essential and should not be forgotten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Politicians should clarify the objectives of the European integration process, explaining them to European citizens and pointing out the steps envisaged in the years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The role of central bankers is to be critical, yet at the same time constructive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They should indicate the economic consequences and the risks of certain steps, stipulating under which conditions certain steps can safely be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.37,0)">It is better to take a step later, but successfully, than to take it prematurely and then fail and fall back further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Such a role will not always make the central banker popular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.68,0)">He or she will often be perceived as stepping firmly on the brakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Nonetheless, I am convinced that it is the best service he or she can provide in furthering the progress of the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It may sound paradoxical, but by continuously emphasising the importance of fulfilling the convergence criteria, central bankers have contributed to making possible the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.58,0)">It has perhaps already been forgotten by some, but this event was not considered very likely by many observers, even close to the date on which it actually happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">European integration is an ongoing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It will continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.34,0)">What does the future hold in store?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">Let me now turn to this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The future of European integration 3.1 Introduction European integration is a task of great magnitude, and will remain so in the next century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">It offers many opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It faces many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I would classify these challenges in three categories and look at them from the perspective of the central banker: How to make the euro and Economic and Monetary Union   a success; How to cope with the accession of new countries to the EU and the euro area; How to develop the role of Europe, the European Central Bank   and the Eurosystem   in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I shall now discuss these challenges in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">3.2 How to make the euro and EMU a success In the first category, I would make a distinction between what central bankers can do or what is within their control, or what they can influence on the one hand, and what the outside world should do or is likely to do with an impact on the central bank world, on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">3.2.1 The role of central bankers The most important task and challenge for the Eurosystem is to build up a track record of actual price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Action speaks louder than words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Showing in practice that we are capable of providing stable prices is what really counts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">We have to ensure that European citizens are confident that the euro is a currency, which can sustain its value over time, and that the ECB is an institution which they can trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB should be perceived as an institution that says what it does and does what it says.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem should develop into truly European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They should always take their decisions and conduct their analyses from a euro area-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Although some good progress has been made in this regard, there is still room for further improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Additional efforts will also be required in finalising the process of setting up and consolidating the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For instance, the ECB began life with a staff of around 400 persons, which in the meantime has grown to more than 700.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It is likely to grow further in the years ahead, but it has to be recognised that there are limits to the pace at which the organisation can be expanded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.48,0)">It is fair to say that at the moment the ECB is capable of fulfilling its tasks, but that the pressure of work in many areas is still simply too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As will become clear later in this lecture, some new tasks will have to be taken up in the years ahead, while others need to be enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">While expanding, it has to be ensured that the ECB remains an efficient organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What is more, the role of the ECB, as the central bank representing the second largest economic area of the world with a population of 300 million people, has to be shaped and elaborated further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Setting up the ECB is a fascinating process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is like the European integration process itself, but on a micro scale and under very great pressure of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In some respects, the process of establishing and consolidating the ECB and the Eurosystem could serve as an example for the European integration process in a wider sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.01,0)">The Eurosystem will have to explain time and again what monetary policy can and cannot do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Our mandate of maintaining price stability in the euro area in the medium term has to be emphasised continuously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our medium-term orientation should be underlined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">It is not in the power of a central bank to deliver price stability on a short-term basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.27,0)">We cannot and should not respond to every twist and turn in economic data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">The Eurosystem's stance is not an "activist" one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The more successful we are at maintaining price stability, the more important it may become to communicate the benefits of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.23,0)">The memories of periods of high inflation with its damaging consequences may fade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It cannot be taken for granted that the reason for the independence of the ECB is widely known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Having such knowledge widely distributed is crucial for the maintenance of price stability in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">No central bank, however independent on paper, can maintain price stability in the longer term in practice if not supported in the execution of its mandate and in its independence by a large part of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is certainly the case for a new and young central bank which has the task of conducting monetary policy for an area consisting of eleven different countries, with populations from different cultural, economic and historical backgrounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.12,0)">The euro is not and cannot be a cure for all European problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.22,0)">The introduction of the euro will not in itself solve the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.76,0)">Monetary policy is neither the cause nor the solution of the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.11,0)">Structural reforms are needed to attack it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Fortunately, this insight is gaining broader support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The challenge now is to translate it into sustained action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.07,0)">Carrying out structural reforms is politically difficult, since they may be painful in the short term and only bear fruit over a longer time scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">However, it is encouraging to note that those countries which have implemented structural reforms have indeed been more effective in coping with the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.85,0)">I shall continue to focus on the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.06,0)">Unemployment is a waste of resources, leaves human potential unused, is a source of frustration and ultimately undermines the stability of our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.16,0)">In a narrower vein, the existence of a high level of unemployment may also hamper the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.36,0)">It can all too easily lead to calls for an expansionary monetary policy as a solution to a problem which monetary policy cannot solve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.2,0)">The central bank could become the scapegoat for failure to take action in areas where action on the part of others is what is in fact required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Making markets more adaptable is also necessary for making EMU work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Only flexible markets will be able to cope with the asymmetric shocks which can sometimes affect any monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The policies needed to make EMU work are, at the same time, essential to reducing unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A single currency does not call for uniform wage developments or uniform economic or social policies in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">On the contrary - where national or regional economic developments are different, this should be reflected in different policy responses and wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Moreover, different reactions to similar problems make it possible to learn from each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The existence of a single currency and 11 fiscal authorities is a unique phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This can only work if the Member States strictly apply the Stability and Growth Pact, which calls for the reduction of government deficits to close to balance or to create a surplus in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In this way, room is created for letting the automatic stabilisers work in response to both asymmetric and symmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Such a fiscal policy is required not only for EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It has its own merits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.21,0)">The ageing of the population calls for such a policy line independently of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The need for fiscal consolidation is not just the result of creating the euro, but would be a key element in any sound fiscal policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It remains to be seen whether the Stability and Growth Pact goes far enough in compensating for the absence of one fiscal authority in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">We should be ready to learn from experience and adapt our institutional framework if and when the need arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This applies, of course, in a more general sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">EMU has been well prepared, but actually playing the game is always different from preparing the game plan, important as this may be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A good game plan is necessary, but not sufficient to win the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.99,0)">While it is as yet unknown whether the Stability and Growth Pact will be the last word on fiscal policies in the euro area, it is certain that a failure to adhere strictly to the Pact would be a recipe for all manner of problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The Eurosystem has adopted a monetary policy strategy which is tailored to the unique conditions of introducing a new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our two-pillar strategy, with its emphasis on monetary developments and a broadly based outlook for price stability, takes into account that economic behaviour may change as a result of the introduction of the euro itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">In other words, it takes into account that the start of EMU constitutes a structural break.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This already indicates that after some time our experience with conducting monetary policy within this framework will have to be carefully evaluated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Over time our strategy may evolve, perhaps in the direction of greater emphasis on one of the pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.23,0)">However, this has to be a cautious process, since one of the main functions of a monetary policy strategy is to provide a tool for clearly communicating monetary policy preparation and decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.34,0)">Thus, you cannot change your monetary policy strategy as you would change suits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">Continuity must be a feature of any monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">Although the primary task of the ECB and the Eurosystem is to conduct monetary policy, there are also other tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It is only natural that up to now we have very much focused on our primary task, and there is thus ample scope for further reflection upon and implementation of these other tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this context I am referring to the task and role of the ECB in maintaining financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">All modern central banks are active in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They are involved in legislative processes relating to the financial sector and play a role in designing the market structure, in surveying the financial markets and in monitoring key players in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB is already involved in the first two areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It has an advisory role in respect of legislation concerning the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With regard to the market structure, an active role is being played in the context of payment and securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The other two roles could be developed further in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">The European financial markets, especially those for longer-term instruments, are not yet fully integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.54,0)">There is not, as yet, a completely single market for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.49,0)">Pan-European banks are not yet a dominant feature of the European financial landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.81,0)">However, the situation is clearly dynamic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The introduction of the euro did not trigger this process, but is certainly giving it a boost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Mergers and restructuring are taking place, albeit on an as yet predominantly national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, this may, and probably will, change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The European Commission is taking many initiatives to further enhance the single market for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">These initiatives are highly welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Financial sector issues will tend, more and more, to become European issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is hard to predict the pace of this process, but its direction is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This conclusion underlines the importance of the ECB's further strengthening its ability to deal with matters relating to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Banking supervision is a national responsibility, although intensive international co-operation does exist, inter alia - though not exclusively - at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Given the current European financial landscape, the decentralised structure of banking supervision in Europe can be defended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">However, in the years to come the question of whether the adequacy of this framework is undermined by developments in the financial sector will have to be closely monitored and analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It is reassuring that the Treaty on European Union contains a provision which enables the Council of Ministers to further enhance the role of the ECB in the field of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In the relatively near future the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins will be on the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This is another important step in the process of introducing the euro, albeit not so much for economic reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The decisive step was of course taken this year through the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates, but it is the step to be taken in early 2002 which will make the euro visible and the significance thereof should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The introduction of the banknotes and coins will offer a further opportunity for informing European citizens about the euro and EMU in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Open communication with many parties - from the economics professor to the members of the European Parliament and ordinary European citizens - is high on the agenda of the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Our wish is to be open, transparent and, as far as possible, predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.59,0)">This is basically the case for three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">First, a central bank which is understood will be more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Second, in a democratic society the other side of the coin of central bank independence is that the central bank should be accountable for its actions in fulfilling its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Third, a clear framework for external communication will structure and discipline internal debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Our aim is to be predictable but let me make one thing quite clear: ultimately, it is achieving our objective of price stability which is of overriding importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In other words - although we will try to avoid such a situation - we shall not refrain from surprising the markets by taking an unexpected measure if we firmly believe that this is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.26,0)">It has to be kept in mind that monetary policy is different from mechanics: it always involves judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">If that were not the case, a good personal computer would be a better central banker than an ordinary human being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">An important starting-point for our communication policy is that the Governing Council of the ECB is a collegiate body where decisions are taken from a euro area-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">What we wish to communicate are the decisions of that body, not those of individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">This does not rule out also presenting the arguments for and against a certain decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">That is what we do in substance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.84,0)">Every month the Vice-President and I hold a press conference immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In an introductory statement I explain our decisions and on what basis we have taken them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is followed by a question and answer session with a large number of journalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Both the introductory statement and the questions and answers are published on our Web site, almost without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">I believe this arrangement is both a unique and - from our perspective - demanding one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In addition, we publish a Monthly Bulletin in all 11 official languages of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We publish an Annual Report and there are many speeches, interviews and publications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">At quarterly intervals I appear at a hearing before the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Nobody should doubt our intention to be open and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.78,0)">Unfortunately, the debate on this issue has often focused on our practice of not publishing the minutes of Governing Council meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">In substance my introductory statements are not so different from what other central banks would call minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.58,0)">And they are published immediately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">As to the substance of what we publish, two issues remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">First, we do not reveal voting records for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">As I said, the Governing Council is a collegiate body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">What is relevant are the final decisions of that body and the underlying arguments, not the individual positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.36,0)">Publishing individual positions can easily distract from what is really important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What is of paramount importance in the European context is that members of the Governing Council do not represent a particular country or their national central bank and that decisions should always be based on euro area-wide considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is a new principle and everything should be done to ensure that it is adhered to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.32,0)">Publishing voting records could easily lead to placing monetary policy debates in a national context and even to putting pressure on individual Council members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.92,0)">The second issue is that, for the time being, we do not publish our economic forecasts, including our inflation forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Again we have several reasons for not yet doing so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It is crucial that our monetary policy strategy be well understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">Publishing inflation forecasts could easily be interpreted as the ECB following a strategy of direct inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.57,0)">This is not the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.83,0)">Inflation forecasts have no exclusive role in our monetary policy discussions and decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They are among many other indicators which we analyse in the context of the second pillar of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.58,0)">Publishing inflation forecasts could make them become self-fulfilling prophecies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.79,0)">This may hamper monetary policy where forecast inflation is incompatible with maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">Finally, due to the structural break which the introduction of the euro constitutes, some time will be required to obtain estimates which are sufficiently reliable for publication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">At the same time, I would acknowledge that, if presented clearly within the context of our strategy, forecasts may also enhance our transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thus we should indeed consider publishing forecasts at some point in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In our external communications we aim to speak with one voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The collegiate character of the Governing Council underpins this principle and facilitates the process of ensuring that monetary policy decisions are transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is not always easy and here we are clearly in a learning phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is the case on a more general level too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">Communication is more an art than a science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">We will certainly try to learn from experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.15,0)">Verbal discipline and transparency are not contradictions: they should be two sides of the same coin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We aim to be predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This will be easier if we can predict how the media will interpret and publish our communications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.57,0)">This is not yet always the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.69,0)">Communication should not be a one-way street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The ECB must also take note of and be sensitive to its environment in order to be effective in its own policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me therefore now turn to the issue of our wider environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">3.2.2 The environment Monetary policy cannot be conducted in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.95,0)">The ECB cannot operate on an island.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">It needs a strong European foundation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">This is an issue which touches upon much more than just the framework for monetary policy or even for EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In the longer term having a single currency means that ultimately we are sitting in the same boat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.36,0)">It is inevitable that sometimes the single monetary policy will not be perfectly tailored to a certain region or even to a certain country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is the case in all monetary unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Optimal currency areas do exist in textbooks, but not in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Thus, for a monetary union to be viable, the absence of perfectly tailored policies will have to be accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This may sometimes require a feeling of belonging together - social cohesion if you like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.18,0)">I believe this may be even more fundamental than the discussion on the establishment of political union, which is often a poorly defined concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Increasing political integration and creating or changing joint political institutions may help to foster social cohesion but, like the ECB, these institutions cannot operate in a vacuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They also require a certain amount of social cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Moving solely on the political front may not be enough and it may not be the first or even most important thing to be accomplished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Fostering this process of enhancing social cohesion is not a simple task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is not something which can or should be imposed from above, but it can, to a certain extent, be guided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">It is a process which must be both evolutionary and spontaneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Its pace cannot be forced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.17,0)">This would be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In the end it is a matter of clarifying and further developing elements of a common European culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This implies articulating and emphasising the many things which Europeans already have in common, but also building up more common experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Such experiences can serve to cement intra-European relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Having a single currency will automatically contribute to this process, not only because of the common banknotes and coins, but also because it will mean dealing with identical issues in all European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are many other areas in addition to politics and economics where this can be done, such as the sciences, the arts, the press, television and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We should try to develop debate on European issues at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I attach great importance to explaining our monetary policies at the hearings in the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary policy is conducted from a European perspective and should therefore primarily be explained at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More attention should be paid to European issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The objectives of European integration should be explained more often and more clearly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.25,0)">The fear that Europe is something abstract, remote and threatening to local culture should be taken seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">However, I do not believe that there necessarily has to be a contradiction between preserving local culture and at the same time further developing a common European culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">On the contrary, they can complement and enrich one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is necessary and inevitable that an increasing number of issues be decided at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">Quite apart from issues relating to the euro, other issues such as those relating to the environment, crime, defence and migration can no longer be considered to be purely national issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In deciding on what should and should not be discussed on a European level, the principle of subsidiarity should continue to play a guiding role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.97,0)">What can be decided at a lower level should be decided at a lower level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I do not close my eyes to the existence of substantial obstacles to further integration in this broad sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Perhaps the fact that the European Union has 11 official languages is the most important one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.52,0)">In a sense it also poses a dilemma in our communications policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">On the one hand, it is very important to reach all European citizens in their own language; on the other, should we not encourage a situation in which as many Europeans as possible also speak one common language?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.19,0)">Could our education systems not make this happen?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This cannot, of course, be accomplished overnight, but should we not at least try to make the issue less sensitive than it still is?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">History is in some respects another barrier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">There is no alternative but to recognise this and work to overcome it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I believe this lies at the heart of the European integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">European integration has been, is and will continue to be, a step-by-step process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">It will certainly suffer setbacks at times, but on balance it is contributing to peace, stability and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.69,0)">What often strikes me is the negative, gloomy attitude of many Europeans towards European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This project deserves a different attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">We should see Europe as an opportunity, a positive challenge, rather than as a threat or a cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">European integration is a unique and fascinating process and I wish that this were more strongly reflected in the attitude of many towards it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We also need the energy which is born of such an attitude to deal with the challenge posed by the accession of new countries to the European Union and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">Let me now turn to that issue and deal with it from the perspective of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">3.3 Coping with the accession of new countries to the EU and the euro area Four countries of the European Union have not yet adopted the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">They may well join in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">A greater challenge is the potential accession of still more countries to the European Union and ultimately the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Negotiations are currently being conducted with six countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Negotiations with another six candidates may start soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The so-called Copenhagen criteria must be fulfilled for EU membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">They read as follows: stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities  ; the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the European Union  ; and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.45,0)">Accession is a political decision, but it is clear that the entry of new members into the EU will have consequences for the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The three steps of accession to the EU, becoming a member of the exchange rate system ERM II and adopting the euro should be seen as a continuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This autumn, EMU issues will be on the agenda for negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is only natural that the Eurosystem will become more involved in this process in the future both in its advisory role and because of the implications for its own tasks and objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Eurosystem should be involved in the accession process and in other forms of co-operation with the applicant countries on all issues falling within its exclusive or shared areas of competence: monetary policy, exchange rate policy, payment systems, financial stability and the impact of enlargement on the Eurosystem itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Currently we are in the process of defining our position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me briefly outline some preliminary observations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The Eurosystem needs to have an open and positive attitude towards the prospect of the accession of new EU Member States, as well as their subsequent participation in ERM II and adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The Eurosystem should be prepared to advise these countries in pursuing appropriate structural reforms and stability-oriented policies in line with accession and convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The Eurosystem should stand ready to provide technical assistance to accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The accession process implies a significant body of preparatory work on the part of the central banks of the applicant countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This work may be facilitated by external technical assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Equal treatment should be a key feature of the accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Objective and uniform criteria should apply both to accession, and to participation in ERM II and adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">These criteria, related to each step of the process, should be implemented in a strict and effective manner, in order to provide the countries concerned with the external constraints necessary to bring their economies in line with the respective standards and the final goal of EMU, while also avoiding any discrimination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Against the background of different starting-points and degrees of economic transition, and the difficulty of ascertaining the lead time for further headway towards real and nominal convergence, a plurality of approaches should be feasible without compromising equality of treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This may apply, in particular, to the timing of EU accession, ERM II membership, monetary policies   before EU accession and the development of sound financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Eurosystem will always focus on the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Hence, our involvement in the accession process, including technical assistance, and any arrangement or other forms of co-operation with accession countries must be without prejudice to the Eurosystem's independence and its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The process for ultimately adopting the euro is clearly stipulated in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The convergence criteria play an important role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Institutional adjustments of the Eurosystem required by enlargement should preserve the efficient functioning of the Eurosystem and its ability to maintain price stability in an enlarged euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.75,0)">In the case of previous enlargements, the entry of new Member States often brought about so-called "arithmetical adjustments" to the composition of the EU institutions, which entered into force with the ratification of the Accession Agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, an enlargement by as many as 12 new countries may require more substantial adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is one of the reasons why a new Intergovernmental Conference will be convened on enlargement-related issues by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this regard, as provided for in the Treaty on European Union, the Eurosystem would stand ready to take part in any initiative taken by the competent EU institutions on issues falling within its competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Such institutional adjustments should be without prejudice to the fundamental features of the Statute of the ESCB, namely the Eurosystem's mandate and its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me now turn to the role of Europe, the ECB and the Eurosystem in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">3.4 The role for Europe, the ECB and the Eurosystem in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The euro is the currency of an economic area with a population of nearly 300 million people and one-sixth of the world's gross domestic product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Both numbers will increase as new countries enter Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">After the US dollar, but ahead of the Japanese yen, the euro is the second most widely used currency on a world-wide scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Given these facts, it is stating the obvious to say that the euro and the Eurosystem are bound to play an important role in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">With regard to the international role of the euro, the Eurosystem has adopted a neutral stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We shall neither hinder nor actively promote this role, but leave its development to market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">To put it another way, there is and shall be no policy of challenging the position of the dollar, nor that of any other currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Of course, to the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in maintaining price stability it will almost at the same time automatically foster the euro's international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The euro already has an important international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">This role is likely to grow over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">The pace of this process cannot be precisely predicted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">If history is any guide, it may well be a rather gradual process, although I would not rule out that this time it may well evolve faster than history would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.35,0)">The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem clearly rules out any implicit or explicit targets or target zones against third currencies, such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen, without the consent of the Eurosystem itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.17,0)">The pursuit of an exchange rate target could easily compromise the achievement of price stability and thereby also have a negative impact on real economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.01,0)">The fact that we do not have an exchange rate target does not imply that we are indifferent to exchange rate developments or that we will neglect them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">On the contrary, the effective exchange rate of the euro is monitored as a potentially important indicator for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem stand ready to contribute to the international exchange of information and views on economic policy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In fact we already play our role in many international fora and meetings, such as the G 7, the G 10, the OECD, the BIS and the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB has obtained observer status at the IMF and is to become a shareholder of the BIS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The best contribution the Eurosystem can make to international stability is to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.88,0)">Attempts at international policy co-ordination beyond the scope that I have just indicated could easily become counterproductive, compromising both the Eurosystem's mandate and international financial stability itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Eurosystem's role on the international scene will tend to expand and develop over time, in step with its growing experience and the gradual evolution of the ECB's organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">In the context of international co-operation, the Eurosystem and the ECB will also play an increasing role in providing technical assistance in their fields of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Since the number of parties in the international arena should fall as a result of the establishment of EMU and the Eurosystem, co-operation at an international level should potentially become easier than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.54,0)">However, arriving at this situation may take some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">From a more general point of view, Europe should aim at becoming a stronger partner in international co-operation and, as far as possible, at speaking with one voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Such an ideal cannot be realised overnight, but every effort possible should be made to move in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">A stronger, more integrated and coherent Europe is in the interests of the world at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">To be able to play this role on the international scene, Europe should keep an eye on the rest of the world and, in spite of the many challenges it will face internally in the years and even decades ahead, should avoid adopting an exclusively introspective stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I come to a conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Conclusion I have discussed three areas in which Europe will have to be active in the immediate and longer-term future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.54,0)">They concern the euro area, the wider Europe and Europe in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Each of these areas already offers enough challenges in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The fact that progress has to be made in all three areas simultaneously makes Europe's agenda for the next century even more exciting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Europe has the potential to meet these challenges, if it is clear about its objectives and, as in the past, is flexible in its way to achieving of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">If Europe is successful, the lives of its citizens will be improved, and it will be a stable and stabilising factor in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Success will not come automatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It will require substantial efforts and the will of many persons and institutions in many areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, these efforts, if successful, will be amply rewarded.</span>
