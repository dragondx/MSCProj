    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Five Years of the Euro: Successes and New Challenges Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBConference organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the University of Texas at Austin on “Five Years of the Euro: Successes and New Challenges”, Dallas, 14 May 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me first express my pleasure to be here with you this evening, and let me also thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the University of Texas at Austin for their invitation to this very interesting conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, the theme of this conference is, of course, very close to my heart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">After five years with the euro, it is both interesting and useful to look back at the experiences we have made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">At the same time, there is always a need to look ahead towards the new challenges facing us on the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">As the historic expansion of the European Union only two weeks ago reminded us, the European project is a dynamic process, that from time to time brings about great changes to the framework in which we operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">As central bankers, responsible for the conduct of monetary policy in this changing environment, we need to be able to adapt not only to the normal fluctuations of the economy, but also to these more fundamental structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">EMU in a historical perspective I would like to start by briefly providing you with an overview of the development of the European Union during the last five decades or so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">While the foundation of today’s European Union was the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early 50’s, one could argue that the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 signalled the beginning of the modern EU of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">With this treaty, the European Economic Community was established with six member states – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands – as of 1958.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Over the next few decades, the number of member states grew successively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In 1992 the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union, was signed, and this treaty also laid down the blueprint for the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">By 1995, the EU had grown to 15 member states, and the number of participating countries remained unchanged until two weeks ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">During this period, we saw the introduction of the euro in 11 of the Member States in 1999, with Greece following as the 12th member in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The most recent major event in the history of the EU was of course the accession of ten new members to the union earlier this month, the largest ever expansion in the history of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">During the rest of my talk here today, I would like to focus mainly on the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">While the implementation of EMU certainly was a giant undertaking and a unique project, I think that one should remember that the concept of a currency union is not a new idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">In fact, one can go back all the way to the Roman Empire, or the Quin and Han dynasties of China around 200 B.C.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">to 200 A.D., to find early examples of universal currencies being introduced, although the institutional framework arguably was different from the one in today’s euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Focusing on somewhat more recent European experiences, let me mention three examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first is the German Zollverein of the early 19th century, which gradually unified the fragmented states of the German Confederation, by establishing a customs union and eventually also a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">The second is the Latin Monetary Union, formalised in 1865, in which the exchange rates of the Belgian, French, Swiss, Italian, Greek, and Bulgarian currencies were fixed against one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The third example I would like to mention is the Scandinavian Monetary Union  , in which Sweden, Denmark, and Norway set up a currency union similar to that of the Latin Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">While successful during a number of decades, both of these arrangements effectively broke down as a result of World War In modern times, we have a few examples of successful currency unions predating EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One obvious example is the currency union between Belgium and Luxembourg, which was established in the 1920’s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There are also two examples of successful multinational currency unions in recent times: the British Caribbean Currency Board   and the Communauté Financière Africaine  , established in the Caribbean and in a number of former French colonies in Africa in the 1950’s and 60’s, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">An interesting observation is perhaps that these two currency unions share the feature that several countries gave up control of monetary policy to supranational central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.71,0)">Conditions for successful currency unions Many of the early currency unions were the result of political considerations rather than economic arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.48,0)">Moreover, the necessary economic conditions for successful implementation of monetary unions were not very well understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In fact, not until the 1960’s did rigorous academic analysis of these issues begin to surface, starting with Mundell’s   seminal work on Optimum Currency Areas  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In a nutshell, Mundell argued that a common currency area should be defined by economic similarity, rather than by political borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">To be more specific, according to Mundell, a common currency is more suitable, the greater   the similarity of shocks or cycles,   the extent of trade,   the degree of labour mobility, and   the degree of risk-sharing among the countries participating in the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These theoretical criteria will, of course, never be perfectly satisfied in the real world, although they are useful guiding principles when planning for and implementing a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In addition, one should keep in mind that economic features related to Mundell’s criteria vary over time, and may in fact be significantly influenced by the introduction of a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the case of EMU, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 specified a number of convergence criteria, which Member States needed to meet before entering into the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">These criteria, which included convergence towards price stability, sound public finances, exchange rate stability and low and stable long-term interest rates, are still in place for future applicants to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Setting aside the specific case of EMU for a minute, what can we say in general about the conditions necessary for a successful implementation of a monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Apart from the economic conditions mentioned before, a key ingredient is that the political will to go through with the project exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, once implemented, a common currency area requires a single monetary policy and a common central bank, as demonstrated by historical examples of failed currency unions in the absence of these ingredients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">I have already mentioned a number of economic criteria, but let me stress again the need for flexibility in labour, product, and capital markets as important ingredients for a successful currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In addition, mechanisms for effectively dealing with asymmetric shocks should be present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.34,0)">Finally, let me mention one further condition, which to my mind, sometimes does not receive the attention it merits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This is the need for a sufficient degree of cohesion among the societies participating in the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.83,0)">Without common values and shared goals, the construction of a stable and successful monetary union will always be a difficult undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.44,0)">Early on during the build-up of EMU, a great deal of scepticism towards the idea of a common European currency surfaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.96,0)">This was often related to criticism that Europe did not satisfy the conditions for a successful currency union I just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.99,0)">Specifically, some argued that Europe could not be considered an optimum currency area, and that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy will lead to imbalances as a result of asymmetric shocks and a low degree of factor mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.3,0)">Critics also claimed that the EU did not have sufficient mechanisms in place to deal with asymmetric shocks through fiscal transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.05,0)">Some doubted the political determination to realise the entire project, while other sceptics argued that the nations in Europe did not share similar goals, and that a monetary union therefore inevitably would result in disagreement and conflict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.98,0)">Martin Feldstein even went so far as to predict that the tensions would become so great that they could lead to another war in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.21,0)">The experience of the past five years Looking back at the experience over the past five years with the euro, I am inclined to say that the sceptics were wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As we all know, the euro was successfully introduced in 11 countries on 1 January 1999  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">At the same time, a completely new monetary policy framework was introduced, with the European Central Bank in charge of a single, stability-oriented monetary policy for the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This, in combination with the convergence of general economic policies that took place during the run-up to the introduction of the euro, provided an environment supportive of greater macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Another important result of monetary unification was the improved resilience against crises in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Without a common currency, I am convinced that a number of countries – in particular some of the smaller ones – would have experienced more pronounced adverse effects in times of turbulent market conditions, than was the case in the last five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">One of the most profound economic changes in Europe over the past few years has been the deepening integration of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This has been the result both of the elimination of intra-area exchange rate risk, and of private and public initiatives to foster financial integration through harmonised regulations and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This has led to enhanced breadth and efficiency of European financial markets, which in turn is conducive to a more efficient allocation of capital, and ultimately supportive of greater potential growth in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Before turning to economic developments during the last five years in some more detail, let me point out a few other observations related to the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">One is the, perhaps obvious, observation that the euro has been established as a major international currency, alongside the U.S. dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The euro is the second-most widely used currency in the world, both as a reserve currency as well as an investment and transaction currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This can be seen as a sign of markets’ confidence in the euro as a stable and trusted currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Moreover, the euro area, which now comprises one of the two largest economies in the world, has become a major international economic partner of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The euro area as a whole, rather than its individual countries, is now considered by the rest of the world when international macroeconomic issues are discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">No account of developments in the euro area would be complete without mentioning the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The logistics of this cash changeover for over 300 million European citizens represented a tremendous challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Thanks to the careful preparations of the ECB, the national central banks, financial institutions, and individual firms, the changeover went remarkably smoothly, and the new physical currency was immediately accepted by the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I would now like to return to the experiences we have had with the euro during the last five years, from an economic viewpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Since it is the responsibility of the ECB to safeguard the value of the euro, I will begin by discussing developments primarily in the internal value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, I will also briefly touch upon the exchange rate developments in the first years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.35,0)">As you know, the ECB defines price stability as an annual inflation rate for the euro area below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In a clarification of the monetary policy strategy last year, the ECB announced that it would aim to maintain inflation rates close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.25,0)">Looking back at the period since the introduction of the euro, the average inflation rate in the euro area was exactly 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.81,0)">Occasionally, the inflation rate has moved above the 2% ceiling as a result of temporary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.16,0)">Despite this, it is interesting to note that long-term inflation expectations   have remained consistently below 2% since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.85,0)">Another aspect of euro area price developments concerns the dispersion of inflation rates across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.31,0)">As you may recall, one of the criticisms against EMU was that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy would lead to imbalances, such as highly disparate inflation rates, with a resulting loss of competitiveness and higher unemployment in some areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">A closer look at the dispersion of inflation rates among euro area member states reveals that the convergence programmes in place prior to the introduction of the euro significantly reduced inflation differences among individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.29,0)">Moreover, a comparison with inflation dispersion in the US   shows that since 1999, inflation dispersion in the euro area has been persistently close to the low levels seen in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Taken together, the evidence points to a relatively successful five-year period with respect to euro area price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.48,0)">One common criticism against the monetary union during the initial period after the introduction of the euro related to what was perceived as a deep and protracted slide in the value of the euro relative to other currencies, and in particular relative to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.1,0)">During the last two years, this trend has been fully reversed, leading instead to some concerns about the degree of volatility in foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While excessive volatility certainly is not beneficial, it may be useful to view developments in the euro’s exchange rate in a longer-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Looking at developments over the past 25 years, we see that the swings we have witnessed in the euro exchange rate during the past five years are not extraordinary compared to synthetic measures of the EUR/USD exchange rate, or the real effective exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Hence, while we can debate whether the volatility in foreign exchange markets reflects fundamentals in a reasonable way, I would at least contend that the fluctuations of the euro exchange rate during the past five years are not exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As I already mentioned, some of the most important economic changes in Europe in recent years have taken place in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The introduction of the euro promoted further financial market integration, although the integration process started earlier in many market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Linked to this, the depth and breadth of markets has increased, as the elimination of exchange rate risk and the removal of intra-area currency matching rules has allowed many more investors to access the various markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In addition, intra-area exchange rate risk premia have disappeared, which, in combination with reduced premia linked to the increased emphasis on stability-oriented economic policies, has significantly reduced financing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.42,0)">Ten-year euro area government bond yields, for example, have remained at historically low levels, on average below 5%, since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Another important development in euro area financial markets during the last five years has been the rapid growth of new market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The euro-denominated corporate bond market, for example, grew from less than 400 billion EUR of outstanding bonds in 1998 to over one trillion EUR late last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Moreover, apart from this impressive growth in the market as a whole, completely new market segments saw the light of day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In particular, the high-yield segment of the euro area corporate bond market grew from virtually non-existent to a significant portion of the market over the last five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">All in all, monetary unification seems to have been highly beneficial for euro area financial markets, although there is still some way to go before reaching the depth, liquidity and degree of integration of US markets, at least for some segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Questions and challenges for the future In the light of the generally positive experiences during the first five years with the euro, it would seem appropriate to ask if and how this may influence other parts of the world in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We could, for example, ask whether we will see more monetary unions forming in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">My guess is that the “euro experiment” will have shown convincingly that it is possible to successfully form currency unions, even with a large number of participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">More close to home, we can wonder whether the experiences of the last five years will persuade all EU Member States to adopt the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">One can argue that the EMU process has played a stabilising, or perhaps an educational role for many of the Member States that joined two weeks ago, in that it has clearly shown the value of macroeconomic stability and discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">I believe that it will continue to do so, both for countries that will seek to join the euro area, as well as for countries that will want to join the EU at some point in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">As such, the monetary union can be seen as providing a valuable contribution to economic stability, also outside the euro area itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The euro area also faces important questions for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">How can the dynamism of the European economy be improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">How can productivity be improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">What can we do to boost growth and employment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">How can trade be stimulated further?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The answers to these questions will prove important in determining the long-term success of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A look at the economic performance of the euro area during the past five years highlights some of the challenges facing Europe in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For example, while trade both within the euro area and with partners outside the area increased immediately after the introduction of the euro, some had hoped for an even more pronounced and persistent effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.92,0)">As for economic growth, real GDP growth in the euro area picked up markedly shortly after the introduction of the euro, but the performance thereafter has been relatively disappointing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.45,0)">Perhaps the greatest challenge facing European economic policymakers is the persistently high unemployment rates in Europe, despite an initial improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.7,0)">In addition, we are faced with challenges relating to the fiscal situation in a number of European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.45,0)">While government deficits decreased continuously in the run-up to the introduction of the euro, and for a while thereafter, more recently, deficits have tended to increase again, partly as a result of weak economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How do we address these problems?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">First, we must recognise that there is a clear need for structural reforms to ensure higher sustained growth and employment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">High on the list of needed reforms should be more flexible labour markets as well as fewer restrictions and lower taxes on labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Swift progress in the implementation of these and other necessary structural reforms will boost confidence among investors and consumers, thereby fostering economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, it is crucial that Member States adhere to the fiscal rules that are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This will this ensure sustainability of the public finances of all countries, and contribute to a sound macroeconomic environment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">So far, monetary policy has been successful in maintaining price stability in the euro area, and it has therefore provided the best possible contribution it can make to sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">However, looking ahead, we face the challenge of continuing to build confidence in monetary policy for the euro area, and of improving the degree of transparency and communication about the goals and the conduct of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.31,0)">We will also face challenges to economic policies related to the recent enlargement of EU, and in the future related to the enlargement of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">However, with the experiences we have gained during the last five years, I am convinced that these challenges will be overcome efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Finally, despite the acceleration of financial integration we have witnessed in recent years, I still believe that promoting further integration in euro area financial markets remains an important challenge for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This will involve continued efforts to harmonise legal frameworks, rules and regulations, and institutional structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Key ingredients in this work will be the harmonisation of clearing and settlement systems in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.51,0)">Conclusions So, what is the bottom line of all this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I would like to put it like this: Monetary unification has definitely been a success – despite all the critical views that were expressed before the project was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Monetary policy has achieved its goal to maintain price stability and is working well to provide full support to promote higher sustained growth rates and macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">EMU has already led to further integration of European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However much remains to be done in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The biggest challenges ahead will be to improve the economic dynamics of the euro area, to digest EU enlargement and to implement structural reforms in order to improve the long term growth potential and to cope with future challenges like population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I remain confident about the ability of Europe to meet these challenges in a successful way in the future and hope that you will join me in stating that a strong European economy is not only in the interest of Europe, but also important for the United States and the world economy as a whole.</span>
