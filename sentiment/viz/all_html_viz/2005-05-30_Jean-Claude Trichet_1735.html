    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> The European economy: current situation, prospects, challenges Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB,delivered at the “Forum économique international des Amériques” Conférence de Montréal,30 May 2005, Montreal Mr Prime Minister, Mr Mayor, Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with great pleasure that I have come to attend the debate and discussion at the international economic forum of the Americas/Montreal conference, and more especially to address you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The issue chosen for the forum this year, “Success at a time of turbulence”, is especially relevant in a world beset by constant economic, financial and technological change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So I would like today to share the European experience with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Allow me first of all to discuss the recent development of economic activity in the euro area, the better to underscore the prospects and to describe the challenges to be faced if Europe is to make its own contribution to the growth of a world undergoing in-depth transformation and thus tending to be turbulent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The economy of the euro area: a stable macroeconomic situation, but economic dynamism that requires further stimulation Since its establishment over six years ago, Economic and Monetary Union has helped to provide a stable macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Over the past few years, the annual inflation rate in the euro area has remained slightly higher than our own definition of price stability, that is a rise in prices of less than 2 % and close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.88,0)">Yet this situation is more a reflection of temporary shocks linked in particular to the trend in the price of crude oil, than to any underlying inflationary trend, which remains generally moderate today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Inflation expectations have remained anchored at under 2%, in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.03,0)">The fact that the run of oil price hikes has not jeopardised the stability of inflation expectations is no mere coincidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It is a mark of success, showing the high credibility level of the young European Central Bank, which has proven capable of convincingly providing businessmen in an economic area with a population of some 306 million, with a stable anchorage point for their price expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Thus, as long as inflation and inflation expectations remain solidly anchored to levels compatible with price stability, monetary policy will make a crucial contribution to economic growth by fostering an exceptionally low interest level on the short, medium and long-term markets, and by creating an economic environment that entails minimal distortion and that helps businessmen to make the best decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In the medium term, the euro area’s prospects rest on crucial factors that should not be overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Allow me to briefly run through them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">On the external level, worldwide activity is fated to remain healthy and it is expected to help sustain European exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">On the internal level, investment should continue to benefit from financial conditions that are, historically speaking, exceptionally favourable in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">It should benefit also from an improvement in businesses’ results and their increased productivity due to past restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Moreover, private consumption is likely to grow in keeping with the growth in real income that is expected to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.09,0)">Yet in the shorter term, since the second half of 2004, growth in the euro area has been modest, below the area’s potential growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">It is still positive, of course, but modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.57,0)">There can be no doubt that the increasing cost of raw materials   has led to increasing uncertainty over economic prospects and that it continues to loom as a risk of far from secondary importance, as indeed do imbalances at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.77,0)">Furthermore, consumers are taking their time to rediscover the path of confidence, doubtless on account of a still difficult situation in the labour market, of difficulties and delays in the implementation of basic reforms, and of a feeling of insecurity due to insufficient budget consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Sure enough, a good monetary strategy guaranteeing the solid anchoring of price stability is a necessary precondition for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">It is not a condition that is sufficient in itself, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">A budget strategy guaranteeing healthy public finances and structural reforms making it possible to raise the level of potential economic growth are also crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">An examination of the trend in labour productivity in Europe and in the United States is particularly enlightening in this connection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.2,0)">Over the past few years, despite tangible progress in terms of overall employment growth and activity rates, a slowdown in the rise in hourly productivity in the euro area has been the main cause of the gap in economic growth between the euro area and the other major economy in the industrially advanced world, namely the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This, especially because over the same period of time the United States has enjoyed a strong boost to its hourly productivity, thanks in particular to its efficient use of new information and communication technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Thus while growth in hourly productivity in the 1980s stood at 2.4% on average in the euro area and at 1.3% in the United States, that trend inverted between 1996 and 2004, with an annual average in the euro area and in the United States of 1.3% and of 2.5% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.52,0)">The lack of sufficient structural reform in Europe is, in my view, the main cause of the gap in economic growth between Europe and the United States that we have seen over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">If we are to impart a fresh thrust to Europe’s growth potential and to help boost consumer and business confidence, we need to work on the European economy’s most crucial underlying weaknesses and to implement basic reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Allowing the labour market to work better with a view to boosting growth in employment and productivity, completing the establishment of a large single market, and promoting investment and innovation will be the best way of allowing the European economy to adapt to international competition, to foster the development of businesses, and to accelerate economic growth and the creation of lasting employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Structural reforms I must say that – although uneven across European countries – significant progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been made, and such an effort should be recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, there is still a long way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In Lisbon in 2000, Heads of State and governments have committed to make the European Union “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The decision on the specific structural reform measures, their design and actual implementation should be left to the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">While getting closer to one another, EU countries still differ in many respects: in their structure, economic development and institutional setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.92,0)">Leaving it up to the national actors to decide on their reforms is just the natural consequence of such differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">However, these reforms should take the EU consensus on policy priorities and objectives as a clear and common reference point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Again, let me stress that implementing structural reforms is not an easy task; it needs a lot of courage and determination on the part of governments, parliaments and social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">However, these reforms are most definitely needed, along with stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policy, as an essential ingredient to ensure higher prosperity and job creation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Let me now focus on two areas where I think further progress is most urgently needed: labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In product markets, there are still considerable productivity gains to be reaped in Europe by removing the remaining barriers to competition that still remain at national and EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The creation of a common market based on the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is a cornerstone of the European Union since the Treaty of Rome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The completion of the single market, in particular in the sector of financial services, is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">An essential factor of technological progress and diffusion is human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Indeed, thanks to technological advancements, economic activity becomes increasingly knowledge-based and jobs shift from low to high-skilled workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.18,0)">However, investment in human capital development in Europe remains insufficient, and a strong focus should be put on improving education and training systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.34,0)">Europe also suffers from insufficient quantitative and qualitative efforts as regards investment in research and development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">As an example at present only two EU countries exceed the target for R&D spending of 3% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.61,0)">All the other EU countries lag behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">More efforts in this field are clearly needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Further reforms in labour markets are also crucial in order to improve the flexibility of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It is essential to provide incentives for more people to enter the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Increasing labour participation and utilisation is a core challenge for policy, particularly for females, the young and older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Some countries have started to implement reforms in order to reduce the disincentives to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Unemployment insurance schemes have been amended and early retirement incentives have been reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Take for instance Denmark and Sweden, where various reforms to improve work incentives and avoid labour supply constraints have been implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">In Denmark, measures aimed at reducing taxes on labour income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.01,0)">In Sweden, reforms mainly targeted older workers, immigrants and younger workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Well, both Denmark and Sweden have already exceeded all the EU employment targets, including those for women and for older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">These are two examples where the reform progress in this area has produced clear benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.68,0)">However, although unemployment insurance systems have been streamlined, in a number of cases, together with high marginal tax rates and social security contributions, they continue to provide a disincentive to take up work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">EU enlargement Meeting these challenges has become even more important with the historic enlargement of the European Union in May last year from 15 to 25 Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Let me first stress that I am convinced that the enlargement entails opportunities and benefits for the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.39,0)">The economic benefits of enlargement are sometimes neglected in discussions, often overshadowed by fears, such as the risk of mass migration after opening up borders with the new Member States, involving increased pressure on labour markets and welfare systems of the other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">I do believe that the EU enlargement will contribute positively to economic growth and welfare in the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It will provide new opportunities to trade and investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The enlargement of the Internal Market will strengthen the degree of competition as the accession of the new Member States has increased the number of suppliers within the Internal Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In addition, enlargement has enhanced the scope for economies of scale, as the extension of the Internal Market increased the size of the market available to suppliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This should translate in lower prices and increased productivity, thereby contributing to a higher potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, these benefits will not be realised automatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Again, in this respect too, there are substantial benefits associated with the implementation of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In particular, a forceful and prompt completion of the enlarged Internal Market in both the old and the new Member States is essential to fully exploit the benefits of the present enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me say a few words on the ERM II membership which has already been decided for six currencies out of the ten currencies of the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Having proceeded with the necessary structural adjustments, participation in ERM II can be an important means of anchoring exchange rate and inflation expectations, and of promoting discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">It can help orient macroeconomic policies to stability, while at the same time allowing for a degree of flexibility, if needed, through the wide standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In any case, there is not a uniform path to the adoption of the euro and each country will be judged on its own merits before adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">And, as required by the Treaty, the sustainable convergence of the economies concerned will be carefully checked both in the interest of the country concerned and in the interest of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.75,0)">Fiscal discipline Finally, I would like to discuss another major challenge that Europe is going to have to face over the next 50 years: an ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.95,0)">A few figures may help to illustrate the magnitude of this challenge: According to the forecasts of Eurostat, the European statistics institute, the population of working age   is going to drop from 67.2% of the overall population in 2004 to 56.7% in 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the same time, the proportion of retired people   is going to rise from 16.4% of the overall population in 2004 to 29.9% in 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">These figures are self-explanatory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.8,0)">We are on the eve of an unprecedented demographic upheaval which is going to put a major strain on public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.4,0)">Ageing is going to translate into significant additional budget costs, generally estimated for the next few decades   at between 3 and 5% of GDP in the majority of European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.81,0)">These forecasts show quite clearly that demographic change without appropriate reform is likely to weigh down very heavily on public finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I would like to draw your attention to the most important effects of these developments on the sustainability of public finance and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">The pressure that an ageing population will have on public spending could threaten the sustainability of public finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.64,0)">Without a change in policy, public spending due to ageing will lead to a growth in deficits and to an inevitable increase in the public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These developments will also reflect on businessmen's forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.54,0)">A drop in confidence in Government signatures due to forecasts of an increased risk of default on the public debt could multiply “risk premia” and foster a financial environment less conducive to investment and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.96,0)">With an ageing population, spending on share-out pension systems is going to increase at the same time as the social security contribution base decreases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the light of such a situation, adjustments in the parameters of these systems, such as for instance a rise in the real retirement age, seem to be essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">And more fundamental changes to the structure of pension funding seem to be essential too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.09,0)">Growing pressure on the funding of public health systems also calls for courageous reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Reform of social safety nets is one of the crucial factors, among many others, that will allow us to control the public debt, to guarantee the sustainability of public finance, and to boost growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The immediate adoption of a strategy of ambitious reforms along with a firm and credible budget consolidation policy would help to boost Europe’s growth potential without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In the case of the euro area economies, boosting businessmen’s confidence in budget sustainability and in long-term economic stability as well as in the maintenance of a suitable welfare policy and of reasonable compulsory contribution rates would more than make up for the negative effects that the reforms and budget consolidation might have on demand in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.08,0)">The larger the imbalances forecast, the more these “Ricardian”, non “Keynesian”, effects are likely to be seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.52,0)">And an ageing population means major budgetary imbalances in Europe’s future, naturally if the countries concerned fail to take appropriate action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In the face of a challenge of this nature, it is crucial to implement the new version of the Pact for Stability and Growth in a stringent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The Pact is essential from the standpoint of the Economic and Monetary Union’s cohesion, and in that connection it is one of the keystones of confidence in Europe’s economic stability, thus one of the keystones of investment and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">So it is necessary to work with determination on budget consolidation and on bringing down the public debt in order to take on the challenge of an ageing population and to safeguard the credibility of the European budgetary framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is facing today five major challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Three of them are major challenges that equally apply to all the long industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.84,0)">The last two others are specific to Europe and do not exist anywhere else in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The diagnosis is now clear as regards the first three challenges – the challenge of new technologies, the challenge of globalisation, the challenge of population ageing – which does not mean either that they are easy to solve… For the first challenge, facilitate the deepening and broadening in the whole economy of science and technology, in particular - but not only - of information technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">For the second, organise the new economic framework stemming from the generalisation of the market economy and the very fast economic development of Asian emerging countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">For the third, draw the consequences of population ageing in order to ensure the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The US, Canada and other industrialised countries must tackle the same issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But in addition – and this is a unique situation in the world, a privilege and at the same time a great historic responsibility – Europe must face two other challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">On one hand, Europe has engaged into a long-term process aimed at ensuring its unity on the basis of a voluntary Union between States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">These States share in common some elements of their sovereignty and have already decided to create a single market with a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This is a very ambitious historic transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">On the other hand, Europe must a the same time meet the challenge of a rapid geographic expansion of an immense historical magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We were still 12 countries when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We are now 25, and virtually already 27.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In Europe, are therefore intertwined a unique “vertical” economic and political transformation and a geographic “horizontal” expansion of an immense significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Five major challenges to face, two more that the other industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.96,0)">All these challenges are exciting, all stem from important successes – scientific progress, the economic take-off of big developing countries, progress in medicine, the deepening of the pacific unity of Europe, the fall of the iron curtain – but these challenges are also demanding and difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.33,0)">After the French referendum and before the Dutch referendum, we are facing today a difficult moment for Europe and for our 458 million European fellow citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.83,0)">It is not the first time, and probably not the last time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In his Memoirs Jean MONNET, whose ideas and action are at the roots of the European endeavour writes: “Those who do not want to start an endeavour because they are not fully sure that things will go as they have planned in advance, are condemning themselves to be immobile.” I am sure that Europeans will together find the way allowing them to overcome present difficulties as they did it in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The European Central Bank has a clear mandate given by the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">It preserves today and will preserve tomorrow, as it did in the past, price stability and confidence in the currency, which are necessary conditions to sustainable growth and job creations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Confidence is a key word in present circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Europeans can rely on the ECB and on the Eurosystem as a whole to preserve and consolidate this confidence.</span>
