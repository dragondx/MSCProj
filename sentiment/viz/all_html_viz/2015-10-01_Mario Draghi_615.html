    <span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)"> Atlantic Council Remarks Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the 2015 Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award,New York, 1 October 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for honouring me today with this Global Citizen Award.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">And thank you also for honouring, through me, all those who have worked – and continue to work – to maintain the cohesion of the European Union, and to bring its integration process closer to completion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">The fate of Europe is naturally of immediate interest to its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">But it is also indeed of direct relevance to the world at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The European Union and its monetary union are regional projects with global implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is firstly due to the size of Europe in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Though the euro area has not made a major contribution to world growth over the past seven or eight years, it nonetheless accounts for 17% of global GDP and 16% of global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.76,0)">When the integrity of the euro area was under threat, so too was global prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Christine Lagarde, who has chaired many IMF gatherings where the first topic under discussion was the euro area, can testify to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">By the same token, the return of the euro area economy to sustained growth, under the impulse of our monetary policy, is good news for everybody, everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">To my mind, however, there is another reason why the euro area is crucially relevant to the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">It comes from the fact that European integration is by far the most advanced experiment in managing issues that cut across borders, through a combination of international and supranational arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">65 years ago, the founders of the EU decided that we could only achieve results if we were united in facing common problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">At the time, the problem was war and the objective was peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And it worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But now, the nature of the many challenges we face shows how right this approach fundamentally was: think of migrants seeking refuge in our countries, the threat of terrorism, the consequences of climate change, the recent succession of financial and economic crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And these challenges are not specific to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They are global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I am certainly not suggesting that the path followed by Europe to manage them is replicable at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">But the experience we have gathered, the experimentation with supranationalism, the failures and the successes, all carry invaluable information for those involved in managing global issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It may seem at times that we in Europe are not able to cope with these challenges, but we do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Each and every time, we prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.76,0)">And why is that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Because when we work as a union, we can address problems that would overwhelm us if each country tried to address them alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.36,0)">And sometimes, what seems like a difficulty of working together is simply a reflection of the difficulty of overcoming the challenges thrown in our way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.44,0)">One should not mistake the one for the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.22,0)">Many argue that our societies are not homogenous enough to operate as a union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">But others would argue that further integration is necessary to extract all the economies of scale and scope that our union brings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I am firmly in this second camp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And I am firmly among those who believe that we can better protect the interest of citizens in every country by making our Union, to use a phrase from your constitutional tradition, “more perfect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The progress achieved over the past three years to stabilise and strengthen the euro area is real.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Growth is returning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The way forward is well identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And we will not rest until our monetary union is complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is in our interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is also in your interest and that of everybody, everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Thank you very much.</span>
