    <h1> Remarks on the European financial integration and on the management of inflation expectations by the European Central Bank </h1>
    <h2> by Jean-Claude Trichet President of the European Central Bank at the conference “The euro: one currency, one financial market” organised by the European Commission on 19 April 2005 in New York </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)"> Remarks on the European financial integration and on the management of inflation expectations by the European Central Bank by Jean-Claude TrichetPresident of the European Central Bankat the conference“The euro: one currency, one financial market”organised by the European Commission on 19 April 2005 in New York Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would like to share with you today some thoughts on two important topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">First, I would like to address the process of European financial integration, this important European endeavour to which the ECB contributes in many different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And then, I would like to address an issue of mutual relevance for the ECB and for market participants, i.e the monitoring and the management of inflation expectations by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The process of European financial integration Turning to the process of European financial integration, my remarks will focus on two main issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first relates to the reasons why financial integration should be pursued, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">what are the economic benefits of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">The second issue to which I would like to draw your attention concerns the state of play, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">where does the European financial system stand in the process of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">2.1 Why financial integration should be pursued As we all know, financial systems – composed of financial institutions, markets and the infrastructure – serve some basic purposes: among other things, to trade, hedge, diversify and pool risk, to allocate resources and to mobilise savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These functions determine the economic benefits that can be derived from financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Two widely accepted economic benefits of financial integration are: the better sharing and diversification of risk and the potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me explain this in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Financial integration increases the opportunities to share risk and smooth consumption over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The increase in the available set of financial instruments resulting from financial integration, as well as the increased cross-ownership of assets, offers additional possibilities to the agents to diversify portfolios and share idiosyncratic risk across regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As we know from theory, when risk is fully shared in an area, a co-movement in consumption results between agents belonging to different regions of that same area, while consumption does not co-move with region-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The evidence suggests that consumption growth rates in the euro area are less correlated than are GDP growth rates, which means that the opportunities to share risk could still be further exploited in the euro area, thereby creating opportunities for further economic benefits from enhanced financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Let me now turn to the second economic benefit of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Financial integration increases the potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To explain this, I need to introduce the concept of financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The link between financial integration and economic growth is typically derived by first establishing the link between financial development and economic growth, and then the link between financial integration and financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">If we were to describe it with the picture of a chain reaction, the sequence would be: financial integration positively impacts on financial development that in turn has a positive impact on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But let us look at each individual element separately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">There is strong evidence to suggest that financial development, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">the level at which the financial system fulfils its respective functions, which I mentioned earlier, is positively linked with economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This link is established via two main channels: financial development can lead to a more efficient allocation of capital and it can reduce the cost of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me give just one example for each of the two channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As regards the efficient allocation of capital, economic growth is spurred by the fact that in a more developed financial system, the intermediaries are more effective in dealing with problems of asymmetric information, so more funds will be allocated to more profitable projects and the productivity of the economy will increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">As regards the reduction in the cost of capital, more developed financial systems can raise the fraction of savings channelled to investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So I now turn to the link between financial integration and financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The economies of scale involved in financial intermediation can foster the expansion of the established intermediaries and markets of the financially developed regions, thereby leading to further financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Financial integration will increase the supply of funds for investment opportunities in less financially developed regions of the integrating area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The integration process will increase competitive pressure, and thereby increase the efficiency of the financial system of less developed regions; it will reduce the cost of financial services, and thus expand the size of the local financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In some cases, the additional supply of financial services may be provided by intermediaries entering the local market either by acquiring local banks or by merging with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Given that greater efficiency stimulates the demand for both funds and financial services, this should also result in financial markets increasing in size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Let me conclude this review of the benefits of financial integration with an empirical result regarding the link between financial integration and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">While acknowledging the difficulty of measuring empirically the effect of financial integration on financial development and growth, the overall conclusion of such studies is that the effects are significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Let me mention here a study that estimated additional growth – resulting from financial integration of the European bond and equity markets – of 1.1% over a period of ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Despite all caveats that apply to the model underlying the simulations, this result is impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Having laid down the general economic benefits of financial integration, I would now like to discuss the reasons for fostering financial integration which are specific to the ECB and which explain why we attach the highest importance to this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, financial integration has implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Since monetary policy is implemented through the financial system, this system should be as efficient as possible in order to guarantee the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The degree of financial integration is therefore important in determining how effectively this transmission will work in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In this regard, I also mention the ECB’s task of promoting the effective operation of payment systems, as well as its interest in the smooth running of securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As to the contribution to financial stability, the interconnection between financial integration and financial stability has to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I will not discuss in detail here the link between financial integration and financial stability: this fascinating issue deserves a speech of its own!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">Let me just highlight the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There is no simple, clear-cut answer to the question on the link between integration and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">There are complex interrelations, the net impact of which is difficult to gauge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Deeper financial integration, on the one hand, widens the possibilities for financial institutions to manage their relevant risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On the other hand, it can change the interplay of vulnerabilities and the way in which systemic risk stemming from contagion or moral hazard problems spreads in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Clearly, competition emerges as a relevant intermediary in the link between financial integration and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On one side, financial integration brings about the unleashing of competitive forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.93,0)">On the other side, too fierce competition can also lead to less prudent risk-taking behaviour by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As you may know, in 2004, the ECB started to publish its financial stability review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In this report, we summarise our monitoring and assessment of the stability of the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">So, to conclude on the process of financial integration, it is generally agreed that deepening financial integration is beneficial on the whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Given the overall economic benefits, as well as the additional reasons specific to the euro area, the ECB and the Eurosystem as a whole support and complement the private actors’ and public authorities’ actions in the process of financial integration, and I will give you a number of specific examples in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Given the economic benefits that result from financial integration, but also given its implications for and interaction with financial stability, it is of the utmost importance that we monitor the process of financial integration closely and understand what is happening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.98,0)">And this is what the ECB does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As one of our main contributions, we invest resources, on the theoretical side, in research on all aspects of European financial integration, and we invest resources, on the empirical side, in monitoring the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">2.2 Integration of the European financial system Let me turn now to the second issue, namely where do we stand in the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In addition to the research, monitoring and measuring I have already mentioned, there are three other kinds of possible actions on our side: first, we contribute to financial integration by providing specific central banking services; second, we give advice on shaping of the legislative and regulatory framework of the financial system and we act as a rule-maker by issuing regulations; and, third, we can act as a catalyst for private-sector activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These are the multi facets contribution of the ECB to European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would like to start by giving you my summary assessment of the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I would say that quite considerable progress has been made over the recent years although a lot of works remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this by reviewing the process of integration for the various components of the financial system: financial markets and related infrastructures on the one hand, and financial institutions and the regulatory framework on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">2.2.1 Financial markets and related infrastructures Assessing the state of integration is probably rather straightforward for the financial markets component of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Normally, a price exists for a financial instrument or financial service, so one can also use quantitative indicators, based on the law of one price, to measure the degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I should like to mention here that ECB staff is doing substantial research and statistical work in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Indeed, the euro has acted as a catalyst for financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The degree of integration distinctly differs between the market segments, with integration being more advanced the closer the market segment is to the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As we all know, the unsecured interbank deposit market was almost completely integrated right at the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A good example of the ECB acting as a catalyst for private sector action is its calculation and publication of the EONIA rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And I would also like to mention the related infrastructure, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">the TARGET system, which now represents around 90% of the total traffic in large-value payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">With EUR 1.7 trillion settled every day, TARGET is already one of the two largest wholesale payment systems in the world, alongside Fedwire in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">TARGET is a good example of where we have taken direct action by providing central banking services that foster European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We are currently building TARGET2, which is due to go live in 2007 and which will replace the current decentralised system with a single technical platform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">With the functionalities that will be introduced in TARGET2, we also expect it to be one of the most sophisticated payment systems in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">TARGET2 will also further improve financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It will increase cost effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It will allow for the provision of a harmonised level of services across Europe, supported by the implementation of a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">And finally, it will offer new functionalities enabling banks to better integrate their euro liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Moreover, to also mention a retail aspect, the ECB, and the Eurosystem as a whole, fully support the establishment of a Single Euro Payments Area   from 1 January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This means that citizens and enterprises will be able to make payments throughout the euro area from a single bank account using a single set of payment instruments, as easily and safely as today in the national systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In addition, national infrastructures should progressively migrate towards a pan-European payments infrastructure with a view to achieving it by the end of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Consequently, decisions related to the next generation of national systems should be made from a pan-European perspective to ensure compliance with the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The ECB is in a regular contact with the banking industry to seek market participants’ support for these objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">So, this is another example of where we are acting as a catalyst for private sector action to foster financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">Let us now review the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The growing repo market is still somewhat less integrated than the unsecured segment which is fully integrated, but integration progresses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The creation of the EUREPO index – the benchmark for secured money market transactions in the euro area – three years ago was an important market initiative for promoting the repo market’s integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Anecdotal evidence collected via market survey from counterparties active in the repo market suggests that the share of euro area cross-border transactions increased further to around 30% in December 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.23,0)">The least integrated segment of the money market is the short-term paper market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Indeed, this market is not only much smaller than its counterpart in the United States, but it is also segmented along national borders in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In the United States, there is a single and very well developed market for commercial paper, with an outstanding volume of almost USD 1.5 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the EU, the market for comparable instruments is amounting to around EUR 750 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.8,0)">Fragmentation of short-term paper market reduces its depth and liquidity as well as the diversification opportunities for issuers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But I can also give you an example of the ECB’s approach to fostering financial integration by acting as a catalyst for private sector initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The Short-Term European Paper – the so-called STEP – initiative was set up by the ACI Financial Markets Association.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">It aims to promote the convergence of the practices through market players’ voluntary compliance with the standards set out in the STEP Market Convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to support in principle the activities pertaining to the introduction of a STEP label for the first two years after its launch and to produce and publish related statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">After the money market, the market segment closer to the implementation of monetary policy is the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">As regards government securities, a high degree of integration has also been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Yields are driven by common news – euro area-wide shocks – and only a very small fraction can still be explained by local risk factors, although this also varies between the maturity segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Local shocks play the smallest role in the highly liquid ten-year maturity segment, but there is scope for further integration, particularly in shorter maturity segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">As regards the euro corporate bond market, despite the exceptional growth it has witnessed since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In terms of new issuing, the gap with the United States as regards the outstanding volume is still large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">For example, the outstanding volume of bonds issued by non-financial corporations, for example, is now around USD 2.9 trillion in the United States, compared with EUR 600 billion in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The degree of integration of the corporate bond market is, however, fairly high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">The yield differential between corporate bonds is explained predominantly by the rating and by common, maturity and coupon effects, whereby the yield variance explained by the country of issuance is close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">One measure for the integration of equity markets is the cross-sectional dispersion of the country and sector returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">For the euro area, the dispersion of country-specific returns remains non-negligible, but it has become relatively less important in recent years, suggesting a higher degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This development is also supported by the increasing share of investment funds applying a euro area-wide investment strategy – or, in other words, we are observing a decreasing “home bias” in their investment strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This share stayed at the still moderate level of 29% at the end of 2003 and there is still considerable room for it to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I mentioned earlier the money market and its payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Full integration of financial markets will call for appropriate integration of securities trading, clearing and settlement infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">A significant process of consolidation has taken place since the introduction of the euro, although the European securities infrastructure remains fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The ECB has a particular interest in an integrated securities infrastructure because it uses it for collateralisation in the context of its monetary policy implementation and for intraday credit operations for payment system purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.91,0)">In addition, a major disruption in a securities settlement system could undermine the stability of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Let me give you an example of the contribution of the ECB, and the ESCB as a whole, to financial integration in the field of securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This time, I will refer to our responsibility of giving advice to the shaping of the legislative and regulatory framework of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ESCB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators   have jointly drawn up the “Standards for Securities Clearing and Settlement in the European Union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Should a framework directive on clearing and settlement be adopted, which we support in principle, this directive would stipulate high-level principles to be further developed by implementing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">We agree with the European Commission that the ESCB/CESR standards might form the basis of such implementing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In this respect, we also invite the Commission to explicitly recognise the overall responsibilities and tasks of the ECB, together with the national central banks, and in particular their role in the oversight of the securities clearing and settlement infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me now address financial integration from the stand point of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">2.2.2 Financial institutions and the regulatory and supervisory framework Given its pivotal role in channelling funds into the EU economy, a well-integrated banking sector is a prerequisite for achieving a truly single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I would like to describe the degree of integration in the euro area banking sector along three dimensions: first, cross-border consolidation or ownership; second, magnitude of cross-border activities; and, third, cross-border competition  , where I would like to look at aspects of retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">As regards the integration in ownership of euro area banks, banking consolidation has mainly taken place at the domestic level, and it witnessed peaks in the late 1990s when around 80% of all M&As in the EU banking sector involved domestic banks only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">However, between 1999 and 2001 in particular, cross-border banking consolidation increased in both absolute and relative terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As regards cross-border activity of banks in the euro area, cross-border holdings of securities and inter-bank loans have experienced substantial growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, at the end of 2003, around 45% of the securities issued by non-banks were held cross-border, twice as many as five years earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Around 25% of all interbank loans were granted cross-border, also up from around 20% in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.91,0)">In contrast, cross-border loans to non-banks remained unchanged and low at less than 5% of all loans to non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This brings me to a third indicator of banking integration, cross-border competition and, in particular, the pricing of retail bank products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.32,0)">Of course, I fully acknowledge that the process of integrating retail markets is bound by some persistent home biases in lending to and borrowing from non-financial corporations and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I also see some similarities to the observed lack of full cross-state penetration in the United States, after restrictions on cross-state banking were removed in the 1970s and 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The research findings are widely known: in the euro area, retail banking markets remain predominantly local.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Apart from geographical barriers, there are many other reasons for cross-country interest rate differentials, such as economic, structural and institutional factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These factors relate, for example, to differences in regulation, competition, bank-customer relationships and the overall development of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me give a specific example of a retail banking market: the mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">There is some evidence that mortgage rates are less correlated in the euro area than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">Taking into account the size of the mortgage credit market, which in the EU represents an outstanding volume of around EUR 4 trillion, the costs incurred, through incomplete integration, cannot be ignored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In this regard, the ECB supports initiatives from both the private sector and the European Commission to encourage further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">So what we need to do is to remove the remaining obstacles to effective cross-border banking in order to foster cross-border competition and further banking integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me mention a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">In the area of financial regulation and supervision, a key objective is to achieve a high degree of regulatory and supervisory convergence across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This will help to reduce the compliance burden on financial institutions, thus addressing one of the largest remaining obstacles to enhanced cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The extension of the Lamfalussy approach to the banking sector and the establishment of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors   are milestones in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The work of the CEBS is crucial to develop common benchmarks and best practices for the consistent implementation of EU Banking Directives as well as principles for cooperation between home and host supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In addition, the forthcoming revision of the Codified Banking Directive will enhance cross-border co-ordination between supervisors and, in particular, it will provide an enhanced role for the authority responsible for consolidated supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Such an enhanced role will encompass co-ordination in the information exchange and a decision-making process for approving advanced approaches at group level under the Basel II framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">More generally, the ECB welcomed the extension of the Lamfalussy approach to regulation and supervision to all financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB Governing Council also provided its view on the European Commission’s recent review of the Lamfalussy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">These are further important examples of where we have contributed to financial integration by giving advice to the shaping of the legislative and regulatory framework of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And here I come to the preparation of the “post-FSAP strategy” that will soon be formally initiated when the European Commission issues its Green Paper for public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">A promising framework has been established through the completed FSAP measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">And I clearly see the post-FSAP period as a “window of opportunity” for further enhancing financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The ECB will certainly make its contribution in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me already now mention three important elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">First, the focus of the post-FSAP strategy should be on the effective and consistent implementation of the FSAP measures at the national level, with new legislation being kept to the strictly necessary minimum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In this respect, the implementation of the Lamfalussy framework represents a unique opportunity to achieve a consistent regulatory and supervisory framework for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Second, the policies relating to the regulatory and supervisory framework should be complemented by and closely coordinated with other relevant policies for financial services, for instance competition policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">And, third, incentives should be provided for the private sector to play its role in exploiting the opportunities offered by the public action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The role of inflation expectations in the ECB monetary policy strategy Let me now turn to the second topic I would like to address today, namely the role of inflation expectations in the ECB monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.11,0)">3.1 Why do central banks care about inflation expectations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">The notion lying at the core of modern economics is that the expectations held by private agents or market participants about the future economic developments may have an immediate and eventually significant impact on actual economic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.43,0)">For example, focussing on inflation, which is the primary concern of a modern central banker, in many standard models used for quantitative policy analysis there is a direct impact of inflation expectations on the dynamics of actual inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is easy to rationalise this mechanism by thinking about the effect of, say, higher expected inflation on workers’ wage claims, which will be increased today in order to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">More generally, one may also think of the effect of higher expected inflation on firms’ current pricing decisions: these will tend to push up the price of their output in order to compensate for the expected increase in marginal costs of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.71,0)">In both examples, the outcome is that when inflation is expected to increase in the future, it may immediately put upward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Hence, a modern central bank with a public mandate of maintaining price stability must take into account, among other indicators, those related to inflation expectations in order to evaluate at any point in time the overall risks surrounding the attainment of its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">This implies assessing the possible effect of inflation expectations on actual inflation and measuring the degree to which the public regards the central bank’s commitment to attain price stability credible and worthy of trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.54,0)">Unstable inflation expectations dynamics might emerge because market participants do not believe that the central bank is truly committed to maintain price stability or that its assessment of the current, and most likely, development of the economy is not consistent with that objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.57,0)">In such a situation, the task of monetary policy becomes very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.72,0)">Reigning in inflation expectations will demand a tighter monetary policy stance than it would have been deemed necessary in case of full central bank credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.88,0)">In the end, in those circumstances, social welfare will suffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">3.2 Monitoring a wide range of expectation indicators The ECB does not rely on a single indicator when monitoring expectations but rather takes a comprehensive and pragmatic approach that balances off the information provided by various sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.11,0)">By their very nature, inflation expectations are not directly observable or measurable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Furthermore, the way private agents form and update their view on the likely developments of an economic variable, including inflation, is likely to be different in important dimensions across different types of agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.08,0)">From this perspective, relying on a single measure of expected inflation in the context of its assessment of the monetary policy stance may mislead the central bank, even if that measure is constructed on the basis of the central bank’s own internal analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is for those reasons that the ECB makes constant use of several measures of inflation expectations that are either based on surveys, thus providing a direct measure of agents’ expectations, or are based on the analysis of information contained in asset prices, which provide an indirect gauge of the inflation path expected by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.54,0)">To be sure, both measures only represent an imperfect gauge of inflation expectations thus requiring careful analysis and full awareness of the limitations inherent in the information they convey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.41,0)">The survey measures that are typically analysed by the ECB, like the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Consensus Economics forecast or the European Commission’s monthly Business and Consumer Survey, suffer, like all survey measures from the inherent limitation that they are constructed on a restricted and heterogeneous sample of respondents and from the uncertainties linked to the design and the implementation of the survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">Furthermore, also those indirect measures of inflation expectations extracted from asset prices, like the “break-even” inflation rates that are calculated from the yields offered by nominal and inflation-protected bonds with the same maturity present some limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In particular, several premia, like an “inflation risk premium” but also a “liquidity premium,” are potentially embodied in their calculation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.7,0)">Changes in break-even inflation rates over time could therefore reflect changes in the level of expected inflation, but also changes in the perceived degree of uncertainty about future inflation, changes in the perception of the liquidity risk, or a combination of the three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The information that we gather from these diverse sources at present is consistent with a picture of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">For what concerns the survey evidence, it has been extremely stable at the level consistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.96,0)">In the most recent survey, conducted in the 1st quarter of 2005 the mean point estimate for HICP inflation indicated by the respondents to the ECB survey remained close to and below 2%, in line with the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability and with the Survey results for the previous quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This holds true for the expectations relating to the years 2005 and 2006, but also for the five-year period up to 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.4,0)">The comparison with the results of the Survey for the last quarter of 2004 confirms that the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts remains contained, and for the longer horizon has even slightly decreased recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Inflation expectations as embodied in asset prices have also been quite stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The “ten-year” break-even inflation rate calculated from the index-linked both with maturity 2012 and issued by the French Treasury in 2001 has averaged approximately 1.9% since its issuing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This reflects a fairly sound anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area around levels consistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.36,0)">We nevertheless observed an episode of transient instability occurring during the Spring and the Summer 2004, when the dynamics in oil prices caused global inflation expectations to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.16,0)">As a consequence, in the euro area, the break-even inflation rate peaked at 2.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Those movements proved to be short-lived and the break-even inflation rate has since returned to levels that are closer to our definition of price stability, albeit marginally above 2%, possibly owing to the recent renewed upward pressures on oil price, which have increased beyond the 50 US Dollar threshold since February 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The slight discrepancy between break-even inflation rates and survey expectations does not suggest at the moment, that long-term inflation expectations are not correctly anchored in line with the definition of price stability: We must take into account, in particular, the “inflation risk premium” embedded in the break-even inflation – given the uncertainties prevailing in oil markets -- and the tendency of that discrepancy to diminish over the last months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, these evolutions of break-even inflations rates command continuous monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">3.3 Concluding remarks: The role of the ECB monetary policy strategy in anchoring inflation expectations Let me conclude my intervention with some remarks on the link between the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and inflation expectations over the few years since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It remains absolutely remarkable that the real progress made in reducing inflation expectations in the core currency area in the few months leading up to the final decision over EMU participation in May 1998 was fully preserved at the moment of the transition and afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">It is my opinion that much of this success is owed to the monetary policy strategy adopted by the ECB in October 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.18,0)">This is not to deny that since the mid-1990s inflation and its volatility have declined significantly worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">However, it would be very hard to overlook the fact that our strategy allowed us to materialise what few observers at the time had considered possible: that the new currency could inherit, from day one of its existence, the best anchoring properties that were available in Europe’s most revered monetary tradition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">And that the solid anchoring of expectations which had been brought about by the completion of the transition to monetary union could be fully preserved all along the past six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The founding principles which I view as the distinctive necessary conditions to such a remarkable achievement can be summarised in some decisive factors of the institutional framework of EMU on the one hand and of the ECB’s monetary strategy on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First of all, the Treaty clearly establishes that monetary policy in the euro area is conducted by an independent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The Treaty itself guarantees for the independence of the ECB thereby ensuring that the ECB will have no impediment in pursuing its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Market participants in the euro area as well as social partners and the public at large know with certainty that the maintenance of price stability over time will not depend on short-term considerations of any nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This is certainly a necessary pre-condition for the anchoring of long term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Turning to the elements of the strategy that are more directly instrumental in helping long term inflation expectations to be firmly anchored to the ECB’s definition of price stability, I shall list first the clarity of the ECB’s objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council aims at maintaining the euro area inflation rate at “below and close to 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The wording is precise enough to provide a reference point for those individuals, social partners and market participants who need to take decisions based on the price outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">At the same time, the definition of the inflation objective takes into account both the uncertainty that monetary policy has to face and the limits to its own actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">It is my opinion that inflation expectations in the euro area have proved to be consistently anchored in the medium term because everybody has appreciated the ECB’s honesty and transparency as well as its firm commitment to ensure price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Furthermore, people have recognised in the quantitative definition of price stability complete continuity with the definition existing before in the national currency areas that had crystallized the highest level of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The second element of the strategy that, I think, provides a solid conceptual anchoring to inflation expectations is the comprehensiveness that characterises the macroeconomic analysis leading up to the Governing Council’s policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB has always explained that its approach to organising, evaluating and crosschecking the information relevant for assessing the risks to price stability is based on two analytical perspectives, referred to as the “two pillars”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The two-pillar approach is a way of conveying to the public the notion of a diversified analysis and of ensuring robust decision-making based on different analytical perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In particular, by taking into account the two different, real and monetary, perspectives, the ECB is best equipped to assess the risk to price stability over the short-to-medium term and the long term, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">It is my belief that our careful monitoring of monetary phenomena and our continuous vigilance upon to the developments in monetary aggregates is reflected in the stability of long term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Finally, let me stress the importance of the medium term orientation of the strategy in anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.81,0)">The ECB has always refused to give any specific definition of what it intends as "medium term".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.95,0)">This reflects the awareness that monetary policy affects price developments with variable and uncertain time lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And it rests on the notion that the optimal monetary policy response to shocks with a view to ensuring price stability always depends on the specific nature and size of the shocks affecting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Hence, the medium-term orientation gives the ECB the flexibility required to respond in an appropriate manner to avoid that unnecessary volatility may, over the medium term, be detrimental to its own objective of price stability and, ultimately, to social welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The two pillar framework, in conjunction with the medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy conduct has become a distinguishing feature of the strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The public’s understanding of this approach has significantly improved over time and has contributed to preserve the high level of credibility that the ECB has been enjoying since its inception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span
