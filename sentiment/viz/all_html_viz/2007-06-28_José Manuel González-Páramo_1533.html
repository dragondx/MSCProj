    <span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)"> Progress towards a Framework for Financial Stability Assessment Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBOECD World Forum on “Statistics, Knowledge and Policy”Istanbul, 28 June 2007 Introduction I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me to participate in this conference covering such a wide breadth of fascinating and important issues, particularly those related to financial stability that we are focussing on in this session  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">After enduring significant financial turmoil at the start of the decade, it is probably fair to say that Turkey is one of the places in the world where the safeguarding of financial stability is more treasured by policy makers and by the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It goes without saying that, while it is crucial for public authorities responsible for financial stability   to develop mechanisms that contribute to the resolution of crises once they materialise, the primary objective of financial stability policies should be to prevent crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.31,0)">This is obvious if we consider the potential costs of financial crises for the society in terms of foregone output and disruptions to the orderly functioning of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">At the same time, it should be noted that establishing an effective policy framework for crisis prevention by no means guarantees that financial crises will be eliminated forever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For that, systemic risk would need to be eliminated altogether, which is of course not possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Indeed, financial systems cannot be expected to be effective shock-absorbers under all conditions and at all times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.77,0)">In fact, history shows that vulnerabilities in financial systems and the accumulation of imbalances in other sectors of the economy can create sources of risk for macroeconomic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And there have been occasions when, following some form of pro-cyclical financial behaviour or the accumulation of “excesses” during a boom, financial systems have amplified rather than mitigated the effects of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">However, through their commitment to the objective of preserving financial stability, I believe that public authorities can reduce the likelihood of crises and contain the potentially disruptive impact of the latter, should they emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The maintenance of financial stability depends in the first instance on adequate financial regulation   as well as effective prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In my remarks today, I would like to focus on another important tool for crisis prevention: the systematic monitoring and assessment of financial stability conditions aiming at detecting key sources of risk and vulnerability for financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This tool is at the core of the financial stability tasks pursued by central banks, including those which do not have supervisory responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">It focuses on the financial system as a whole as well as on its main components and is normally reflected in the Financial Stability Reviews regularly published by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As you know, since December 2004 the ECB has published a semi-annual Financial Stability Review for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">My main objective today is to briefly present the framework which underpins the analysis presented in this review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, I will explain why central banks, including the ECB, have developed a financial stability assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Then I would like to focus on one important conceptual issue, notably the definition of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I will briefly sketch how we tackle the non-trivial task of measuring the degree of stability in the financial system at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will finally point to some of the challenges that central banks around the world are facing in their financial stability assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The need for financial stability assessment Over the past decade a growing number of central banks around the world have begun to monitor and assess financial stability and many of them now periodically publish their findings in Financial Stability Reviews.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">An important reason behind this development has been the increased frequency of financial crises in the 1990s, both in emerging and mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.43,0)">These crises have shown that risks and vulnerabilities for the financial sector stem not only from developments within the sector itself but also - and to a rather large extent - from changes in the external macro-economic and financial environment in which the sector operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">One of the main lessons drawn from these crises is that it is important to complement the supervisory monitoring of individual institutions with a regular monitoring of conditions in the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In virtue of the expertise acquired in analysing macro-economic and financial developments for monetary policy purposes, central banks are the natural candidates to perform this task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Central banks have a special interest in maintaining financial stability, since a stable financial system is an important pre-condition for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of monetary policy, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the price stability goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the euro area, the Eurosystem has undertaken financial stability monitoring and assessment activities for the area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In doing so, the Eurosystem aims to fulfil its statutory role of contributing to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As regards the internal labour division within the Eurosystem, the ECB Financial Stability Review complements the reviews produced by the national central banks by providing a financial stability analysis from an area-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.12,0)">In general, the financial stability assessment of central banks is confronted with two main difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.93,0)">The first difficulty relates to the increasing complexity and interdependencies of financial systems due to rapid pace of innovation and the ongoing globalisation and integration of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.06,0)">These phenomena may complicate the interpretation of the existing indicators, thereby putting a premium on the need of improving and expanding the statistical framework in order to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.26,0)">The second difficulty refers to the lack of an analytical framework for financial stability assessment as developed as the one available for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This reflects the fact that analytical efforts in the domain of financial stability are still in their infancy, though they have made marked progress in recent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.53,0)">But it also mirrors the undeniable conceptual difficulties inherent in this field, starting with the definition itself of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It is encouraging that many academic institutions, international organizations and central banks, including the ECB, are currently investing resources in developing a sound analytical framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The definition of financial stability Perhaps the most important building block for an analytical framework designed to measure, monitor and safeguard financial stability is to formulate a working definition of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">For policy objectives such as maintaining price stability or fiscal stability, this is a more straightforward task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.06,0)">For financial stability it is less, since there is not even a precise and universally recognised definition of “financial stability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We have worked hard on this at the ECB and the definition we have adopted reads as follows: “ Financial stability can be defined as a condition in which the financial system – comprising of financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructure – is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities.”   This definition encompasses three key elements: financial system, financial stability and a notion of what we mean by financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">All of these are necessary to set the boundaries of the analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Going through each of them in detail, the financial system comprises of three distinct but closely-linked components: the financial intermediaries, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">the institutions that pool funds and risks and allocate them to competing uses, including banks, insurance companies and pension funds, but also other institutions  ; the financial markets which enable the matching of savers and investors and/or risk sellers and risk buyers, thereby serving as an alternative source of finance to financial institutions and allowing risks to be re-distributed among financial intermediaries; the financial infrastructure, including clearance, payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">As both the individual components and the linkages among them constitute the financial system, the maintenance of financial stability requires their collective stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.87,0)">Vulnerabilities in one component may affect the smooth functioning of others, thereby posing a threat to the smooth functioning of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ECB’s understanding of financial stability originates from the notion that there are three distinct aspects of a stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">First, the function of inter-temporal allocation of resources from savers to investors should be facilitated efficiently and smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Second, financial risks should be assessed and priced with a reasonable degree of accuracy and also efficiently managed using a forward-looking approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Third, the financial system should be in a position to comfortably absorb both financial and real economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.54,0)">Should any of these conditions not be satisfied, the financial system would most likely become unstable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The consequences of defining financial stability in this particular way are very interesting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.98,0)">Among them, the inter-temporal and forward-looking aspects of the definition imply that threats to financial stability can arise not only from shocks but also from disorderly adjustments of imbalances built up in the past, perhaps as a result of over-optimistic expectations about future returns or the mis-pricing of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Assessment of financial stability Let me now turn to the issue of the rigorous and accurate assessment of the degree of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.44,0)">The main objective of this assessment is the early identification of risks and vulnerabilities that could threaten the smooth functioning of the financial system, interrupting financial intermediation and imposing real economic costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.45,0)">A list of the potential sources of risks to financial stability could be quite long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">This list would include some risks that are endogenous to the financial system, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.62,0)">related to one of its components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.36,0)">When talking about endogenous risks, we should consider those related to:   financial institutions, including credit, liquidity or reputation risks;   financial markets, such as counterparty risk, contagion or asset price misalignments; and   infrastructures, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.54,0)">legal or regulatory risk, domino effect or systemic risk in payment, clearance or settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Sources of risks which are exogenous to the financial system, particularly those related to macroeconomic disturbances as well as policy actions or disaster events, are of course also very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.3,0)">In practice, the process of assessing financial stability can be divided into three steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In the first step, the overall robustness of the financial system is assessed, taking into account the endogenous sources of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In the second step, the main sources of exogenous risks and vulnerabilities to financial stability should be identified and their probabilities should be evaluated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The third and most challenging step, based on the outcome of the assessment undertaken under the first two steps, is to evaluate the ability of the financial system to absorb shocks, should the identified risks materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Indicators for each of these three steps can be identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, the choice of the appropriate indicators may depend on the composition of the financial system, especially the relative importance of markets and institutions, as well as the institutional set-up of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">Indeed, these are significant differences in financial system structures across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For instance, in a bank-based financial system, the banks solvency ratios would be of much greater importance than in a market-dominated financial system, in which market stability indicators would seem to be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">Because of this multidimensional and multifaceted nature of financial stability, there is as yet no widely accepted set of measurable indicators of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For the same reason, an absolute “single number” for the assessment of financial stability, comparable to the rate of increase of a consumer price index for the assessment of price stability, appears to be elusive for the time being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For example, if measures of the stability of the banking sector indicated underlying strength, but at the same time there were signs of strain in financial markets, the overall assessment of the stability of financial system would be ex-ante ambiguous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Although relatively simple indicators for assessing the soundness of banks have been developed and are widely used, great care is needed in interpreting them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.59,0)">Many financial stability indicators are designed to detect sectoral imbalances and are often calculated as ratios between different balance sheet items.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.21,0)">Because movements in such indicators often have different interpretations, they can be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">For instance, increasing bank solvency may indicate improved shock absorption capacity, but it may also reflect risk aversion and the foregoing of profitable lending opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.04,0)">Hence, rather than indicating stability, high solvency could be a signal of weaknesses developing in a bank in a competitive environment, that may potentially entail loss of market share and profit erosion in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A similar duality of interpretation applies to indicators of the robustness of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.86,0)">Low asset price volatility may be indicative of stable conditions and effective market functioning, but it might also be a signal of failure in the price discovery process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.13,0)">Narrow credit default swap   spreads, for instance, could reflect a perception of low credit risk but may also result from the under-pricing of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">The solution to this identification problem is to cross-check different indicators of the same phenomenon or to combine various measures in composite indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.68,0)">However, this may still not be enough to assess financial stability unambiguously, without looking beneath the surface.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me give one recent concrete example to explain the issue a bit further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In order to identify the drivers behind recent asset price movements, ECB staff has recently constructed a composite indicator of financial market liquidity in the euro area, based on a methodology developed by the Bank of England.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This indicator combines several measures covering four different markets and three different dimensions of market liquidity   as well as liquidity premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Although the indicator has confirmed earlier market intelligence information that financial market liquidity rose substantially in 2003 and has remained high since then, it does not address the question of what are the implications of abundant liquidity for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.72,0)">One cannot assess the influence and potential implications of current market liquidity conditions without looking into the sources of the current abundant liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.97,0)">If liquidity in financial markets is largely a reflection of greater risk appetite as opposed to potentially more lasting factors, such as structural changes in financial markets – and here I am thinking about the development of new investment products, mostly credit derivatives, or the entry by hedge funds into traditionally illiquid markets – then it could suddenly fade away in the event of unexpected market stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.61,0)">All in all, excessive reliance on any single indicator without taking into account the need for a broader assessment of economic and financial conditions on the basis of a comprehensive set of measures may lead to a potentially unsound assessment of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.82,0)">However, it would be unwise to conclude from these observations that financial stability may not be a measurable concept after all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Indeed, even if financial stability is unobservable, we still have statistical techniques at our disposal which can provide quantitative assessments of unobservable phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Although we are far from agreeing on one single measure of financial stability, for the reasons I have just listed, we have made recently progress in quantifying some unobservable variables, which could be included in the information set available to policy-makers for assessing financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For instance, in the most recent issue of the ECB Financial Stability Review, which was published earlier this month, we have introduced a single indicator of investors’ risk appetite derived from a set of market-based and model-based measures of risk aversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An important part of any financial stability assessment is to gauge the shock absorption capacity of the financial system, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">its ability to withstand shocks, should they materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Following the introduction of the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program  , stress-testing has become a standard part of the financial stability assessment tool-kit among central banks, supervisors and financial institutions themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Although important advances have been made in this field, it is important to be aware of the limitations of stress-testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.79,0)">For instance, the approaches commonly applied usually do not include the second round effects of shocks to the financial system resulting, for instance, from the probable tightening of lending terms and conditions by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.4,0)">Moreover, the models are usually based on log-linear relationships, whereas situations of financial stress are usually created by so-called tail events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.88,0)">In such situations, the relationship between variables may be non-linear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Notwithstanding these caveats, stress-testing is an important tool in the process of risk management at a micro-level, particularly in banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">By encouraging financial institutions to carry out stress-testing exercises - also by publishing potential risk scenarios in their Financial Stability Review - central banks promote the ability of the institutions to withstand shocks and thus prevent financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The approach followed at the ECB I would like to briefly sketch how we go about assessing financial stability at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is very broad in scope and encompasses a broad set of indicators, covering the external environment, the euro area economic outlook, the balance sheet conditions of non-financial corporation and households, financial markets, banking sector and other financial institutions as well as financial system infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In particular, a first set of indicators assesses financial sector conditions focusing on banking sector’s balance sheets, profitability, asset quality and capital adequacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These indicators are largely derived from publicly available financial statements and from   supervisory sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A second set of indicators aims to identify the major sources of risk to the financial sector and covers the competitive conditions in the banking sector, credit growth and banking exposure concentrations and more generally, asset price developments, business cycle and monetary conditions as well as indicators of financial fragility in the counterpart sectors to banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">This set of indicators should benefit in the future from the release for the first time in June 2007 of quarterly euro area accounts that will help to shed light on the financial soundness of the main institutional sectors, particularly households and non-financial corporations, by allowing to compute a large variety of indicators, including measures of household indebtedness and corporate leverage as well as income-based measures of sectoral fragility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">These accounts will be released according to a timeline   that will ensure that they are of much greater use for financial stability analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A third set of indicators aims to assess the resilience of the financial sector based on its risk-absorption capacity given its financial condition as well as the appreciation by market participants of banks’ risks and the main sources of risk outlined in the first two sets of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For this purpose, a number of these indicators have been developed based mostly on market based information sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">These indicators are assessed together with additional qualitative information in order to develop an overall assessment of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Nevertheless, because the euro area financial system remains on average more bank-based than market-based in terms of risk-taking activity, we devote quite a bit of attention to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.17,0)">For this, we have developed a methodology for identifying large and complex banking groups   whose size and nature of business is such that their failure or inability to operate would most likely influence adversely the smooth functioning of financial markets or other financial institutions operating within the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Having identified these LCBGs, we periodically monitor their main profitability, solvency and capital-adequacy ratios in order to assess the ability of these institutions to generate profits and withstand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">Other indicators such as returns on risk-weighted assets, trading income relative to Tier 1 capital, loan impairment charges or value at risk   are calculated on the basis of individual institutions’ financial reports and usually presented in the form of frequency distributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is because we are particularly interested in how the financially weakest institutions - the potentially most vulnerable links in the system - are performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">As the balance sheet and profit and loss account based indicators are backward looking in nature, we support our assessment of the banking sector with forward-looking indicators derived from securities prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Among these are option-implied risk-neutral distributions of the Dow Jones Euro STOXX bank index, which provide a quantification of the distribution of expected banks’ equity price outcomes, thereby providing a market assessment of downside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We also monitor some direct indicators of default risk of LCBGs, including Moody’s KMV expected default frequencies or credit default swaps spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.88,0)">Financial markets are the source of large sets of high frequency data which can provide indications of market strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will briefly list only few among the many indicators we use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For instance, bid-ask spreads for EONIA swaps serve as an indicator of liquidity conditions in the euro area money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The evolution of historical market prices as well as of both historical and implied volatilities can provide information on the overall conditions of different markets, particularly equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As regards government bond markets, in addition to the shape of the yield curve, we monitor the term premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We also use typically forward looking indicators, such as the options-implied skewness coefficient for German ten-year bonds in order to assess the likelihood of large future movements in long term bonds yield as perceived by the market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.93,0)">Challenges for financial stability assessment The ongoing process of financial development and integration and a wave of financial innovation, especially in credit markets, are posing challenges for the assessment of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The development of new financial products based on credit derivatives enables financial institutions to transfer risk to more lightly-supervised agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.48,0)">There are some concerns that this may, under certain conditions, effectively lead to new threats to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.6,0)">We should also be aware of the potential problems that credit derivatives can create.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">These include the possibility that banks might tend to soften their risk and pricing standards more structurally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">At the same time, the increasing degree of development and integration of financial markets is reinforcing the linkages among financial institutions, possibly exposing the financial system to new systemic risks due to rising correlation among asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">On the one hand, these developments are enabling financial institutions to achieve a better redistribution of risks, thereby improving their shock absorption capacities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">On the other hand, it is possible that this could create the potential for an amplification of shocks at times of market stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Overall these elements make the financial stability assessment of domestic financial systems more complex and more dependent on external factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">Concluding remarks Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">As I hope I have shown, the ECB has in place a robust approach to financial stability analysis based on an assessment of the condition of the financial system, the sources of risk that could arise and the ability of the system to handle these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The framework to undertake this assessment has at its centre a set of indicators which, in turn, draw on a variety of different data sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.75,0)">Nevertheless, the analytical foundations of financial stability are relatively new, as evidenced by the absence of a universally accepted definition of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.9,0)">Reflecting its novelty, work to develop an appropriate conceptual and statistical framework for financial stability analysis remains in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">While much progress has been made in recent years, we must continue making efforts to improve the theoretical framework and the information dataset underpinning our financial stability assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In doing so, we must remain responsive to the impact of a number of factors related to globalisation, market development and integration as well as innovation on the financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">Ladies and gentleman,</span>
