    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)"> Outlook for the European Economy Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, The Institute of International Finance, Washington DC, 3 October 2004 I am very honoured to have been invited here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I would like to thank the Institute of International Finance, and Charles Dallara   for this invitation, and for giving me this opportunity to share my views on the “Outlook for the European Economy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To do so, I will start by taking a broad definition of Europe and highlight some of its recent historical developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Then, I will focus more narrowly on the euro area, and give my assessment of the current economic and financial situation, and the prospects for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.24,0)">What is Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.5,0)">Giving a speech on the Outlook for the European Economy is always a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">To begin with, you may ask yourself: “What is Europe?” From a geographical perspective, one would certainly include Norway, Switzerland, and ask oneself how far one would go, including Russia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">But from a political and economic perspective, the focus is often different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Less than two decades ago, the focus used to be on “East” versus “West”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But, now the focus is increasingly on the EU member states versus countries on their way to becoming members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And, within the EU, we also talk of the euro area – the economic entity consisting of the 12 EU countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I hope that you will allow me to focus on the part of Europe, I know most about: namely, the EU and the euro area in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Having narrowed my focus somewhat, let me start by reminding you that the 1st of May this year was a historic day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In terms of population, this day marked the largest enlargement of the EU since the creation in 1957— as it was then called - of the European Economic Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">With its 25 member countries, the EU now has a population of 455 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This means that the EU as a whole has the third largest population in the world – after only China and India – and making it larger than the US and Japan combined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">In economic terms, total GDP in the EU was more than twice the GDP of Japan, and close to that of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With some regret I note that, in Europe, there is a habit of focusing mostly on our problems, and the enlargement has been no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Obviously, enlarging the EU with 10 new member countries with a combined population of 75 million is no easy task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.89,0)">And it would be naïve to claim otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">However, the enlargement signifies something much more positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It signifies the progress that has been made since the same countries that are now members of the EU were the same ones that in the 20th century were engaged with one another in bloody conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Indeed, the enlargement is a testimony to the fact that, we have realised that we share fundamental values which we, collectively, want to promote: peace, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In terms of the economic prospects, there are also reasons to be optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Before entering the EU, both the current and new member states prepared themselves intensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">For example, the new members had to demonstrate that they had functioning and competitive market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">While most of the new members have a long way to go to reach average income levels in the EU, the foundations for them to further catch up have been laid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">It is also important to mention that with capital, goods and labour allowed to move freely within the EU, the new members will put pressure on all of us to become more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">And, I think this is good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For the remainder of my speech, I will focus on the euro area, and its economic prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The euro area Before addressing the current state of the euro area economy and its outlook, let me briefly highlight the large strides we have made towards closer integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In less than six years, the euro has been firmly and credibly established as a stable currency, also internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.83,0)">The euro area has witnessed a period of low rates of inflation and low levels of long term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">Most participating countries have had their lowest market interest rates for decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The introduction of the euro in January 1999, and, finally, in the form of banknotes and coins in January 2002 went very smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">The euro has become part of people’s daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Equally important, the ECB's monetary policy has been successful in keeping inflation and inflation expectations under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">All of this was achieved even in the face of substantial adverse shocks, and exceptional economic, financial and geopolitical uncertainty, and with no real precedent to learn from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Although history provided no examples of monetary unions of the magnitude we were about to create, we benefited from a large academic literature on monetary unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">One of the main points emphasised in this literature is the importance of having rules that ensure fiscal discipline amongst the participating member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This was clearly understood and was reflected in the Maastricht Treaty by a set of fiscal rules referred to as the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">As you know, the fiscal rules have given rise to a lively debate in Europe in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.81,0)">Taking a step back, I see this discussion as a reflection of the fact that Europe is still struggling for a political identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">On the monetary policy front, a clear responsibility and competence have been given to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">By contrast, fiscal policy is decided in 12 different countries, each with their own agendas and priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">With only 5 ½ years of experience, it is perhaps not surprising that Europe is still in the process of fully adjusting to a new situation - with one currency, and one central bank with a clear mandate for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Naturally, this monetary policy mandate has implicit consquences for fiscal policies and wage setting behaviour, and this is what Europe still needs to fully adjust to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Adjusting to new circumstances is never easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.18,0)">Especially during periods of slow growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As you know, the euro area has only recently come out of a 2 year period of slow growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Now, though, we see increasing signs of an ongoing recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The current economic situation in the euro area Indeed, the latest data show that, in annualised terms, real GDP grew by 1.2% in the first half of 2004, compared to 0.5% for 2003 as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Moreover, the latest indicators of output and demand remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity Looking ahead, the conditions for a continuation and broadening of the recovery remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Economic growth outside the euro area remains robust, and should continue to support euro area export growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Moreover, private consumption should continue its gradual recovery, broadly in line with growth in real disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Against this background, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to persist and to become more broadly based over the coming quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">This is also reflected in our latest ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">They envisage euro area real GDP growth of between 1.6% and 2.2% on average in 2004, rising to between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">These growth rates are close to most estimates for long-run potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Available forecasts from international organisations and other sources convey a broadly similar picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">I should note that this scenario of an ongoing and further progressing economic recovery is, as always, subject to some risks – in both directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the upside, the ongoing momentum of the recovery may again imply more positive developments for economic growth in the coming quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.39,0)">On the downside, there are still concerns about continuing economic imbalances in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.37,0)">These imbalances could affect the sustainability of the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.29,0)">Another downside risk to the growth projections relates to oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.46,0)">In particular, the oil price increase observed over the last year and particularly the fact that oil prices have remained at a higher than expected level for quite some time could imply risks to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.73,0)">However, when assessing its impact, it should be taken into account that the recent rise in oil prices has been significantly smaller than in previous episodes when oil price increases had a major impact on the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.52,0)">This is not only true when looking at developments in oil prices in USD terms, but particularly when expressed in euro terms, as the past appreciation of the euro had a dampening effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.77,0)">In addition, in real terms, oil prices are significantly below the peaks they have reached in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.4,0)">Moreover, when compared with the 1970s and 1980s, the oil intensity of production in the euro area and elsewhere has fallen significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">In 2001, the oil intensity of the euro area, measured as oil consumption in relation to real GDP, decreased by almost 49%, compared with its peak in 1973.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Finally, while previous oil price increases have mainly been driven by supply factors, the recent increase is also partly due to higher demand for oil, on the back of the strong global expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.52,0)">All these factors put the downside risks to economic activity coming from oil prices, which I do not neglect, into perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.71,0)">Nevertheless, persistently high and even further increasing oil prices would be a reason for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.28,0)">However, recent oil price developments have had a visible direct impact on price developments in the euro area with annual HICP inflation in August at 2.3%, unchanged from July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.51,0)">On the basis of current market expectations for oil prices, it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2% in the remainder of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Looking ahead, however, there are no indications at present of stronger underlying inflationary pressures building up domestically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Recent wage developments have been moderate, and this trend is expected to continue for some time to come in view of the still high level of unemployment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.66,0)">If this is the case, and provided that one-off shocks to prices from other sources such as those seen in 2004 are not repeated, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in 2005, in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.09,0)">Against this background the latest ECB staff projections put average annual HICP inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% for 2004 and between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Structural reforms Let me summarise the assessment of the euro area economy by repeating that there is ongoing evidence that the economic recovery is well underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This is good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">However, to foster confidence in the short to medium-term, to ensure that economic growth is sustainable over a longer horizon, and to raise potential growth, we need to address more fundamental weaknesses in our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This means pursuing structural reforms that are designed to increase the flexibility of markets, increasing employment, promoting innovation and securing the sustainability of social security systems in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">There is a lot to do on this front but fundamental changes are already underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Unlike a few years ago, it is now widely recognised that the accelerated implementation of structural reform, framed within the Lisbon agenda, is the key to making the EU economies more competitive and dynamic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the new member states to the EU are putting pressure on all of us to increase our competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me briefly conclude by summing up what all of this means for the outlook for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">First, integration in Europe is ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">No one expects this to be an easy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">But, and this is my second point, on the economic front, available data point to an ongoing economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Along with the progress I see happening on the structural reforms agenda, the economic upswing provides a tailwind which should make the integration process somewhat easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Let me also underline that we, at the ECB, are doing all what we can for Europe to cope with these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Our best contribution, in conformity with our mandate, is to preserve one of the cornerstones of successful integration: namely, price stability and to be credible in so doing not only on a short to medium term basis but also on a medium to long term basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In fulfilling efficiently this role, the ECB brings about today a major contribution to European prosperity, growth and job creation: in consolidating a low level of medium and long term market rates for the 306 million citizens of the euro area; in preserving the purchasing power of the household which is a necessary condition for consumption growth; and in augmenting the level of confidence of economic agents which is so important in the present juncture in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.</span>
