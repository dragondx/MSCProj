    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.9,0)"> Banking supervision – is variety really the spice of life?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017 Variety is the spice of life, they say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.08,0)">But with regard to regulation and supervision, too much spice spoils the dish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.14,0)">Europe has thus opted for less variety and more harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There is a single European rulebook for banks, there is a single European supervisor and there is a single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">All this helps to make banks safe and sound, and it prepares the ground for a truly European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.81,0)">But below the surface, things are less harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.4,0)">I will just mention three things in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.45,0)">The first thing is the legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.12,0)">The single rulebook is less single than the name implies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Parts of it are have been implemented through EU Directives which provide huge incentives to add as much national spice as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The rulebook also contains a number of options and discretions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">These offer some leeway in applying the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">As European banking supervisors, we have agreed to exercise many of these options and discretions in a harmonised manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Still, there are some which lie in the hands of governments – these too need to be harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The second thing is the scope of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There are very good reasons for supervising specific types of entity at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, these entities are still subject to national supervision and national regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.19,0)">The most obvious examples are large investment firms with cross-border, bank-like activities and third-country branches of non-EU banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.28,0)">In the wake of Brexit, many banks will decide to relocate from the United Kingdom to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And they might choose to set up third-country branches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.89,0)">At the same time, investment firms might also relocate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So I think it would make sense to regulate and supervise them at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">The third thing is the supervisors’ toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There are tools which are available in some countries but not in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.06,0)">The moratorium tool is one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It is crucial for handling bank failures in a safe way; so it should become part of a harmonised European toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.76,0)">To sum up, in my view, there is still too much variety.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.79,0)">To put it another way, there are too many differences when it comes to regulation and supervision in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Such diversity can only be justified when it reflects country-specific risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.4,0)">And that is not always the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">So if we are serious about the banking union, we must strive for more harmonisation.</span>
