    <span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)"> SEPA for cards: more than a symbol of SEPA’s success Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Monnet Symposium organised by The Monnet Project, Madrid, 5 May 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction 5 May is a historic date for European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">61 years ago today, the Treaty of London on the establishment of the Council of Europe was signed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Council of Europe in Strasbourg is one of the oldest international organisations dedicated to facilitating European integration, with the focus on democracy and the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Council of Europe created two symbols which were adopted by the European Economic Community in 1985 and are today used by the European Union: the flag of Europe and the European anthem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The flag of Europe has become the principal symbol of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.82,0)">The circle and the number twelve – which is the number of stars positioned in a circle on the flag – has numerous associations with unity, such as the 12 hours on a clock, 12 months in a year, 12 signs of the zodiac and 12 semitones in an octave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Unity is also a crucial factor in the success of one of the biggest economic projects the European Union has ever seen: the establishment of one single euro payments area – SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">With the united efforts of the European banking community, the legislators and the central banking community, SEPA made a successful start with the introduction of the SEPA credit transfer more than two years ago and the SEPA direct debit last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.07,0)">Of course, SEPA is far from complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The migration to SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits will take some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">I am confident, however, that with the setting of a realistic but ambitious end date, the pace of the migration will increase considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For this reason, I have no concerns regarding the success of a SEPA for credit transfers or direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, SEPA is built on a third column too: SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Cards are the most commonly used payment instrument in the European Union, accounting for almost four out of ten transactions in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Without the success of SEPA for cards, the project will not be complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Very often SEPA for cards is associated with the establishment of an additional European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But SEPA for cards is about much more than that: it is about business rules and technical standards too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">SEPA for cards – business rules The business rules are set out in the SEPA Cards Framework   by the European Payments Council  , as well as the ECB’s “SEPA for Cards” report of November 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Of course, every agreement is to some extent a compromise which tries to accommodate as many views as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.03,0)">That is not to say that there is anything wrong with a compromise per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Without the ability to reach compromises we would, for example never have been able to agree on the design of the euro banknotes since, of course, every country believed its legacy banknotes to be the most beautiful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">However, a compromise should not be too general leaving too much room for interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.59,0)">I have already said on several occasions before that for me the SCF document is perhaps too general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">I think the SCF requires further development, increased clarity and more detailed rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me also recall that in the sixth SEPA progress report we proposed the creation of a card transaction processing framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This would set out the business rules for card schemes and processors with regard to the processing of SEPA card transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">But European projects and initiatives do not relieve individual stakeholders of the responsibility to contribute to European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Major efforts by individual card scheme providers are needed too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Although work has already started in some areas, it is far from finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A number of tasks that I have highlighted on other occasions before are still outstanding: the effective separation of scheme management from processing entities in order to overcome barriers to entry and to contribute to fairer and greater competition between card schemes, as well as between processors; the charges or reporting requirements that some schemes impose on issuers and acquirers for transactions carried out with cards bearing their brand, even if it was not used in the transactions; the setting of the brand that will be used at terminals, without giving the retailer and/or cardholder any choice; and the rule that in cross-border transactions, it is always the interchange fee of the country of the merchant that applies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Europe is not the only region to recognise the importance of clear business rules for the proper functioning of the cards market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Less than a month ago the Canadian government released a code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in Canada, which promotes fair business practices and ensures that merchants and consumers understand the costs and benefits associated with credit and debit cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This follows similar regulatory initiatives in the United States and significant efforts made in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In Europe, strong public intervention is not envisaged for the time being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is up to the EPC and individual card schemes to create the business rules which are needed for a smooth functioning of SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">SEPA for cards – technical standards Business rules are only half the battle for a SEPA for cards, as technical standards are needed too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Last December the EPC published an updated version of the SEPA Cards Standardisation   Card scheme providers have made significant progress over the past year, and are cooperating in the Common Approval Scheme   initiative, and I am looking forward to seeing a clear EPC position, especially on governance aspects, in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Governance is in fact one of the key components in the SEPA for cards project: setting requirements and promoting standards is important, without a doubt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">But, from a European perspective, it is strategically necessary for Europe to take a more coordinated approach towards global standard-setting bodies, such as ISO or EMVCo, and that Europe starts to speak with one voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Giving the EPC, acting on behalf of the European payments industry, a say in these bodies would be a very good way to achieve this aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">European card scheme Since 2006 the Eurosystem has had a great deal to say on the subject of the governance of card payments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In our sixth SEPA progress report we clearly stated that the “Eurosystem expects at least one additional European card scheme to emerge that meets the requirements of cardholders, banks, merchants, competition authorities and the Eurosystem”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Of course, there are Visa and MasterCard, and I would like to emphasise how essential they are to Europe, since they are currently the only schemes that offer a pan-European card payment solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">But we also need a sufficient degree of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The reasons for this call for an additional European scheme are well known and are economically well-founded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The main economic rationale is the possible lack of competition should national card schemes be wound up in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.7,0)">Some small national schemes, such as the Dutch and the Finnish schemes, are being replaced by international ones and they are unlikely to be the last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.95,0)">Moreover, card payments are increasingly substituting for cash payments in the day-to-day lives of a growing number of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.71,0)">With this increasing importance, any mispricing of card payment services would have a major impact on each and every European and on the European economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Therefore, sufficient competition for such an important means of payment is absolutely crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Sometimes it is worth looking beyond the borders and seeing how other regions have addressed challenges like those we currently face in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">China, for example, launched an independent bankcard brand and established an international payment brand: China UnionPay  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">CUP is today accepted in 29 countries and regions in Europe, as well as approximately 60 countries in America, Africa, Oceania and Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Two of the world’s largest economies are expected to follow with the creation of an additional card scheme: namely Russia and India.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">So why not follow these examples and establish an additional card scheme?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me reiterate the importance of the international schemes currently present in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Even with the establishment of an additional European card scheme they are likely to play an important role: for example, in co-branding to promote the global acceptance of an additional European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Currently there are three additional card scheme initiatives, one of which is Monnet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.98,0)">Each of these initiatives has its own strengths and weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Of course, there are still many issues to be resolved – finding a proper financing model being probably the most important one from the point of view of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">We should not overlook the fact that competition authorities have already provided some guidance in this context, although I am aware that it does not satisfy many banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Nevertheless, the agreement between Visa Europe and the European Commission, which was announced last week, has brought some further clarity to the area of card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Naturally, the most obvious component of a financing model are revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, a financing model is not necessarily restricted to the costs and revenues linked to card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It may be worth analysing possible effects on other areas of business too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The reduction in cash handling costs could, for example, form an integral part of the business case when banks evaluate their involvement in one of the initiatives for a European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">I admit that this is far from being an easy task, however, no one ever said that it would be easy to achieve a goal as challenging as the creation of an additional European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Now all parties involved in the various initiatives need to prove their commitment and determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Therefore, I appreciate the fact that Monnet seems to be making great strides and I am looking forward to learning about the next concrete steps and milestones of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Conclusion I started with the Council of Europe and its important contribution to the European identity with the flag of Europe and the European anthem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As you know, the anthem is based on Ludwig van Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” from his Symphony No This is the final symphony that he completed and it is generally considered to be his masterpiece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">When it was first performed on 7 May 1824 in Vienna it received five standing ovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Even though the completion of SEPA is extremely unlikely to receive such enthusiastic applause from the European public, it would be a great achievement with real benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">But without an additional European card scheme, SEPA will remain an unfinished symphony.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">Processing relates to the authorisation of card transactions, as well as their subsequent clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.55,0)">Visa Europe has proposed to reduce to 0.20% the maximum weighted average MIF for all cross-border transactions and for national transactions in a number of Member States using debit cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">It also proposes to maintain and further develop measures which will increase transparency and competition in the payment cards market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This was welcomed by European Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia  .</span>
