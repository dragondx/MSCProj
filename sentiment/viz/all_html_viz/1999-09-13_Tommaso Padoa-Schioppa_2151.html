    <span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)"> Payments and the Eurosystem Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Sibos, Munich, 13 September 1999 Summary Introduction A glance at two centuries The role of the Eurosystem The first fifteen months The main policy issues today Conclusion I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Introduction Payment systems and securities settlement systems   represent one of the basic infrastructures needed for the proper functioning of market economies, as vital as the legal or the transport system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They are an essential component of the transmission mechanism for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The soundness and the smooth operation of PSSS are therefore indispensable for the stability of the currency, the financial system and the economy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In the very same years in which the Treaty of Maastricht was being negociated, a technological revolution was taking place that highlighted the relevant public interest at stake in PSSS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This led the Treaty to give explicit and considerable responsibilities to the Eurosystem in the field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And since the central bank of the euro only came into existence fifteen months ago, both its reflections and its actions about the appropriate fulfilment of such responsibilities must be carefully weighted, knowing the importance of the age of foundation for the long future awaiting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.88,0)">The relevance of PSSS issues is only matched by the persistent lack of familiarity with it of most central bank observers, whether in academia, in the media, or in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">An effort will therefore be made in this paper to explain the issues in a way that requires little prior knowledge from the reader.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The next Section will recall why central banks have always been concerned with the efficiency and safety of payment arrangements and how, in practice, their responsibilities have evolved over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Section III will analyse the statutory tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem in the field of PSSS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.79,0)">Section IV summarises the activities of the Eurosystem in the first fifteen months of its existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, and more importantly, Section V tries to review the main policy issues in which the Eurosystem is likely to be involved over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A glance at two centuries The origin of central banks is closely linked to a revolutionary change experienced by monetary systems in the course of the 19th century: the replacement of commodity currencies with paper currency as means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">While a commodity currency was supported by its intrinsic value, the value of paper money depended on the confidence in the issuer's ability to redeem paper money in commodity money at par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">The "act of faith" on which paper-based systems rely is still reflected in the vocabulary: banknotes are called monnaie fiduciaire in French, moneta fiduciaria in Italian and fiat money in the English literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.41,0)">Freely issued banknotes entailed uncertainties and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.77,0)">They were difficult to recognise because there were so many of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.4,0)">Their value could diminish or even disappear whenever doubts arose about the creditworthiness of the issuer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To ensure the efficiency and the safety of paper currency systems, public authorities gradually entrusted one single commercial bank with the task of issuing banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In Europe, this bank became known as bank of issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A second revolutionary change occurred during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century with the development of bank money, made material by means of entries in the books of the banks: monnaie scripturale in French, moneta scritturale in Italian.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Here again, the value of this form of money depends on the creditworthiness of the issuer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Yet, unlike the issuance of banknotes, the issuance of bank money has remained decentralised within the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Today, the public generally consider banknotes and commercial bank money as perfectly interchangeable and equally safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.37,0)">Banks, however, have always made the difference and have insisted on interbank claims being settled in fiat money:originally banknotes, and, progressively, the dematerialised form of book entries at the banks of issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">Banks of issue became to be known as central banks and their sight liabilities   became for banks and other market participants the ultimate way to settle obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Central bank money also became legal tender, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">the settlement means which market participants must accept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.73,0)">In the following, I shall use the terms "final money" or "central bank money" interchangeably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This historical development shows how much the raison d'Ãªtre of central banks lies in the promotion of the efficiency and the safety of the payment arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, the two other key central banking functions, supervision of commercial banks and monetary policy, stem from the fact that central banks are the issuers of final money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Banking supervision developed because central banks needed to evaluate the soundness of the claims on banks which they accepted as a counterpart for the issuance of final money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Monetary policy, whichdeveloped only subsequently in this century, was made possible by the gradual loosening   of the link between central bank money and gold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Nowadays, the largest proportion of the stock of money are liabilities of commercial   banks, and confidence in the currency ultimately rests on two pillars: first, the possibility of converting commercial bank money into central bank money at par at any moment and, second, the ability of the central bank to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.23,0)">After these revolutionary changes, payment technology settled down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.43,0)">Many decades without changes made central banks' functions in the payment field gradually less prominent than banking supervision and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.67,0)">The efficiency of the payment system came to be considered a merely technical matter, what Gerry Corrigan called the "plumbing" of the monetary system, an area generally dealt with by a sub-unit of the IT department in most central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Although payment systems progressively moved from paper-based into electronic systems, their organisational model remained the 19th century-style clearing house, with multilateral netting of payments and settlement of net balances in central bank money at the end of each day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.98,0)">Exceptions could be found only in countries, such as Germany or the United States, where a decentralised organisation of the central bank could hardly be reconciled with the central clearing house model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In these countries, interbank obligations were settled partly on a gross basis to facilitate the transfer of funds from one central bank entity to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In the middle of the 1970s a new revolution started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.44,0)">It was due to two developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">First, the exponential increase in the value of the payments produced by the phenomenal expansion of financial transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Second, the advent of new money transfer procedures combining electronic data processing and telecommunication technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.36,0)">Central banks quickly understood that settlement risks in the traditional clearing house model had become unmanageable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Payment system issues moved from the back offices to the board rooms again, in both central banks and market participants Central banks reacted to the new developments in two ways: first, they required substantial improvements in the safety features of netting systems and, second, they promoted real-time gross settlement   systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Both reactions were largely organised through international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The first was developed in 1990 at the G10 level, through the "Report on Interbank Netting Schemes",also known as the Lamfalussy Report The report set out minimum standards to ensure that netting systems would be able to complete the settlement phase even in the event of the failure of the participant with the highest debit position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Following the Lamfalussy Report, most netting systems in the world have revised and improved their operational rules and procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The second reaction, the promotion of RTGS systems, was started by the pioneering precedent of the Federal Reserve System in the United States and developed at the EU level within the framework of the European Monetary Institute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">RTGS systems allow the intraday balances between banks to be eliminated and therefore radically reduce systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Today, technological progress has allowed commercial banks to use central bank money as a means of payment on a continuous basis throughout the day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The velocity of circulation of central bank money has risen so much that efficiency no longer requires netting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The evolution was particularly remarkable in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In 1993 the "market share" of RTGS systems was about 5% in value terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In 1998 it reached 50%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In "Euroland", after the successful introduction of TARGET, the share is now close to 70%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Payment systems oversight isthe expression used to describe the function of central banks aiming at ensuring the efficiency and the soundness of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It shares with prudential supervision the objective of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Both functions aim to reduce the risk of instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.21,0)">However, while prudential supervision looks at institutions, payment systems oversight looks at systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.9,0)">Another significant difference is that, while central banks have progressively abandoned commercial lending and deposit collection to avoid conflicts of interest, in the field of payment systems they are not only overseers, but also service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.55,0)">This is unavoidable because central bank money has no substitute as it is the sole means that provides finality to payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A more recent evolution is the extension of payment systems oversight to securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.46,0)">In the settlement of securities transactions central banks used to be involved only as agents for the management of government debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Nowadays, they are concerned about the smooth functioning of overall systems, because of their link to payment circuits and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Since this evolution is not always understood, and sometimes even challenged, it is useful to devote a few words to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For safety reasons, securities transactions have come to be more and more settled, over recent years, on a delivery-versus-payment basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As a result, banks include the payment flows stemming from securities settlement in their intraday liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.88,0)">If these funds are not delivered, or not delivered on time, payment settlement systems could become gridlocked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.31,0)">Moreover, since the liquidity in RTGS systems depends on intraday credit that central banks only grant against collateral, RTGS systems would be blocked if securities were not delivered to the central bank on time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">This would in turn seriously hamper the implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The role of the Eurosystem This glance at two centuries helps to understand that ensuring not only a sound, but also an efficient payment mechanism has been a core function of central banks from their very beginnings and throughout their historical development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It also gives an idea of the richness of the legacy inherited by the central bank of the euro area when it was established last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I now turn tothe heir, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.19,0)">the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The name "Eurosystem" has been coined to designate the European Central Bank   and the National Central Banks   of the Member States which have adopted the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is the central bank of the euro and of Euroland, in the same way as the Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the dollar and of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Member States which do not participate in the euro have retained their separate currencies and continue to conduct independent monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.41,0)">Their central banks are not part of the central bank of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Although a federal and decentralised central bank is not a novelty, the Eurosystem is a special case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The economy and the financial system of the euro area have a much deeper   segmentation than any other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The NCBs that are part of the Eurosystem have for many generations performed the full range of central banking functions on their own responsibility and in a national context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.2,0)">They have been accountable to, and sometimes dependent on, national institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Public opinion has perceived, and still perceives, them as national entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.55,0)">The notion of the public interest they were referring to was the notion of a national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.84,0)">Significant differences existed, and partly remain, in their tasks, organisation, statutes and cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this situation, the Eurosystem has to make an appropriate distinction between being national in the organisational sense and being euro area-wide in the definition of the public interest pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This distinction also needs to be drawn in the field of PSSS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From the very beginning of the debate on Monetary Union, it was agreed that the future central bank of Europe would have responsibilities in the field of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I remember the then President of de Nederlandsche Bank, Wim Duisenberg, proposing to the Delors Committee   that the future European central bank should be "responsible for the maintenance of a properly functioning payment system."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.46,0)">This was in the autumn of 1988; the Delors Report was published in April 1989.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The Treaty followed the recommendations of the Delors Report, which in turn took stock of the revolution experienced by central banks in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As holds true of all central bank legislation and statutes adopted at the beginning of the 1990s, the Treaty explicitly recognises both the oversight and the operational functions of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Its Article 105   states that one of the basic tasks of the Eurosystem is to " promote the smooth operation of payment systems".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The annexed Statute goes further, granting regulatory powers to the ECB under Article 22: "The ECB and national central banks may provide facilities, and the ECB may make regulations, to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Community and with other countries".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">It should be noted that the Treaty makes no distinction between retail and large-value payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.33,0)">In this respect, it does not follow the doctrine according to which central banks should concentrate only on systemic risk issues, which have limited relevance for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On the contrary, the doctrine implicit in the Treaty is that fostering the efficiency and safety of retail payment systems is an integral part of the central bank's responsibility for the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.26,0)">I think this is the right approach, because the public's confidence in the currency would be undermined by financially unsound providers of retail payment services, as well as by an inefficient functioning of retail payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This explains why the Eurosystem is concerned with retail payment systems and, in particular, with their ability to handle the circulation of money in a reliable way and at a low cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I shall come back to this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">Another observation concerns securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The Treaty   does not explicitly mention this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The reason is that, contrary to the oversight of payment systems, central banks' involvement in securities settlement systems has only developed after the adoption of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Yet, as we saw earlier, central banks need to be increasingly concerned about the smooth functioning of securities settlement systems as a consequence of their statutory duties in the field of payment systems and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Eurosystem will not be an exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Within this framework, the Eurosystem will exert its statutory tasks in accordance with two general principles stipulated by the Treaty itself: the market principle and the decentralisation principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let's briefly examine each of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The market principle, laid down in Article 105   of the Treaty, states that: "the   shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources  ".This requires the Eurosystem to take a neutral position in competition between   systems,   financial centres and   categories of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The important implications of the principle of neutrality can be seen in the light of the profound structural and functional changes undergone by national securities and settlement systems in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">These changes were largely driven by market forces, as a result of innovative developments in payment technologies, and by the greater integration of the European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">As a result, PSSS have progressively moved towards increased, although uneven, concentration and specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This in turn has prompted a radical restructuring and reorganisation of the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.28,0)">Figures speak eloquently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">In 1997 the euro area   had 18 large-value payment systems, 23 securities settlement systems and 13 retail payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The United States has 2 large-value systems, 3 securities settlement systems and 3 retail payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This striking difference indicates unmistakably the type of evolution one can expect in Europe for purposes of reaping the full benefits of economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">A vast reorganisation is under way and already well advanced in large-value payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">By contrast, securities settlement systems have only just started to move, and the restructuring of retail payment systems has yet to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As long as market forces do not lead towards unsound or inefficient solutions, the Eurosystem will remain neutral in the current and prospective restructuring of the financial infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.85,0)">Indeed, in a market economy public authorities should intervene only when there is a strong public interest, which the market fails to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">12.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The decentralisation principle stems from Article 12.1 of the ECB Statute, which states that "to the extent deemed possible and appropriate,   the ECB shall have recourse to the national central banks to carry out the operations which form part of the tasks of the  ".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Following this principle, national central banks will continue to be involved in payment system operations in different ways, in line with their national traditions but in accordance with the jointly defined policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Also the actual implementation of oversight, including the discussions with banks and system operators, will take place at the local level whenever a system is strongly rooted in one individual country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It should be noted that the implementation of the decentralisation principle does not mean that the responsibility for operational tasks will fall exclusively onto the NCBs and that oversight responsibilities will fall only onto the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A clear distinction will have to be made between what can be handled at the national level and what must be handled at the Eurosystem's level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, the ECB is operationally involved in the end-of-day procedures of TARGET and many operational features of TARGET have been decided collectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As for oversight, the Eurosystem will in many instances define only the general principles that need to be followed throughout the euro area in order to ensure a level playing-field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Electronic money is a good example of a subject to be discussed at the Eurosystem's level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The elaboration of a single policy line is also required for cross-border systems, such as the Euro 1 system of the Euro Banking Association  , the oversight of which is performed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Action at the Eurosystem level could also be undertaken in the field of cross-border retail payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.13,0)">The first fifteen months 13.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">When the ECB was established, in June 1998, technical preparations were well advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Yet, many important decisions could only be taken after the establishment of the ECB and of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.59,0)">Let me briefly review them, under the three headings of large value payments, securities settlement and retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">14.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In the field of large value payments, the Eurosystem had to achieve two objectives before the start of EMU: the creation of TARGET and the evaluation of the soundness of the other systems which would continue to process large-value payments in parallel with TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">TARGET is an acronym standing for Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It is the RTGS system which the euro needed to achieve between the national central banks of the euro area the same easy transferability of central bank money that existed within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.94,0)">Without such a system, supply and demand for central bank funds would have had to be met on the books of each of the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.76,0)">As a result, money market interest rates would have differed among financial centres, making the implementation of a single monetary policy very difficult, if not impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this respect, the creation of TARGET by the Eurosystem mirrors the creation of Fedwire by the Federal Reserve System in 1918, shortly after its establishment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The establishment of TARGET was, however, also a consequence of the central banks' willingness, in the course of the 1990s, to develop RTGS systems as a safe way to process payments and to minimise systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">TARGET had indeed two objectives: to serve the needs of the single monetary policy and to achieve high security in the payment system infrastructure in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">TARGET consists of the fifteen national RTGS systems of the EU countries and the ECB payment mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">These are interlinked so as to provide a uniform platform for the processing of domestic and cross-border payments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Although technical and organisational features continue to differ across NCBs, the TARGET concept has been built in such a way that the use of the system in the domestic and in the cross-border mode is very similar for commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In accordance with the market principle, the use of TARGET is not mandatory, except for the few payments that are directly connected with monetary policy operations or with the settlement of large-value netting systems in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the first weeks of its existence, the ECB Governing Council took a series of key decisions which could not be taken earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It adopted a legal guideline addressing the relationship between the ECB and all participating NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It decided on the price structure for cross-border TARGET payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Finally, it set the conditions under which banks and national central banks of the EU countries, which had not adopted the euro, could connect to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.26,0)">This last point requires a short explanation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Although the Treaty does not grant "out" NCBs any special right to be a part of TARGET, in 1995 the EMI Council decided that all EU NCBs would be allowed to connect to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The decision was based on the consideration that the technical preparations had to start long before the selection of EU Member States participating in EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">The EMI indicated, however, that the connection of non-participating central banks would be subject to conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Against this background, the ECB Governing Council decided in July 1998 on the conditions under which these central banks could also provide intra-day liquidity in euro to their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The ensuing arrangement was a very innovative one, because it was the first time that a central bank allowed other central banks to provide settlement facilities in its currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A "Policy statement" issued by the ECB in November 1998 clarified that central bank money in euro can only be provided by the central banks belonging to the Eurosystem and indicated that the possibility offered to "out" central banks was a specific exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, the policy statement invited any central bank located outside the euro area to inform the ECB whenever they became aware of a planned settlement arrangement in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">TARGET started its operations on 4 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The statistical data show that the system now settles two-thirds of the value of all payments processed in euro and that both the volumes and values are stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In July 1999, a daily average of nearly 170,000 payments was recorded, for a value of more than EUR 920 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">During that month, domestic TARGET payments represented an average value of EUR 550 billion per day, whereas cross-border TARGET payments reached EUR 370 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The high proportion of cross-border payments is an indication of the successful integration of the euro area money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The importance of payment flows processed also shows that TARGET has met a market need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The figures can be compared with those of Fedwire in the United States which on average processed about 390,000 payments daily in 1998, for a value of about USD1,300 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.27,0)">17.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The second objective of the Eurosystem in the field of large-value payments concerns the safety features of systems which continue to operate in parallel to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are six such systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">Three - in Luxembourg, Finland and Spain - are very small  ; the three remaining ones are the Euro 1 system, Euro Access Frankfurt   and Paris Net Settlement  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The ECB Governing Council assessed the soundness of these systems prior to authorising them to settle in the books of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The payment systems infrastructure of the euro area is very sound since two-thirds of the value of the payments exchanged within the area are made in the RTGS mode, while the rest is settled in systems which meet, as a minimum, the standards set out in the Lamfalussy Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">18.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I now turn to the activities of the Eurosystem in the field of securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The preparatory work conducted in this field aimed at establishing an appropriate infrastructure for the custody and settlement of assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Two main actions related to the management of collateral were carried out in this respect: the establishment of the "Correspondent Central Bank Model"   and the definition of standards for the use of securities settlement systems in Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The existence of a single pool of collateral for monetary policy operations, as well as for Eurosystem intraday credit operations, was a pre-condition for the emergence of a unified money market for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This required a common definition of the assets eligible as collateral, safe and efficient domestic procedures, and the existence of an efficient mechanism to ensure the cross-border transfer of eligible assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In 1996, when it became clear that the market would not be able to create such a mechanism, the EMI decided to create CCBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">CCBM is based on links between central banks for the exchange of information and messages on the securities used as collateral for their credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The concept of CCBM is simple: a market participant can receive credit from its home NCB using collateral located in other Member States; the NCB of the country where the collateral is deposited acts as correspondent for the NCB that grants the credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">CCBM has made the integration of European securities markets possible, allowing cross-border use of collateral in operations involving central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the end of August central banks held an amount of EUR 74 billion on behalf of each other as a result of cross-border use of securities through CCBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This figure stands for about 12% of the collateral used in Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">19.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.23,0)">The second activity in the securities settlement field, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">the definition of standards for the use of settlement systems in Eurosystem credit operations, was also a prerequisite for the smooth start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The objective that all systems would apply the same high standards of safety and efficiency stemmed both from the necessity to ensure a level playing field among the counterparts of the Eurosystem and from the need to protect the Eurosystem against undue settlement or custody risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Eurosystem standards have been published in January 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">They reflect a strong preference for clear legal arrangements, the use of central bank money for settlement, strict limitations on custody risk, and intraday finality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">It is worth noting that the standards, which were defined as standards required by the Eurosystem as a user, have de facto become supervisory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It is so because many systems have committed themselves to implementing the standards not only for operations related to central bank credit, but also for all kinds of operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This evolution is similar to the one experienced long before in the field of banking supervision, when the counterparty assessment made by central banks to protect themselves against the possible failure of their creditor banks became the starting point of prudential rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In December 1998, after an assessment of domestic procedures, the Eurosystem started evaluating the quality of links between securities settlement systems, with the view of ensuring that such links offer the same reliability as the systems themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A first series of 26 links was authorised in June 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">Finally, retail payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.07,0)">The Eurosystem devoted limited attention to this area during its first year of activity, because concentration on large-value payment systems was critical for the smooth transition to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A report on electronic money, however, was adopted in August 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In that report, the Governing Council confirmed its position that only credit institutions should issue electronic money, in order to maintain a level playing field in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That view is not shared by all central banks worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Compared to those of other countries, European banking laws are very liberal in allowing licensed banks to conduct a wide range of activities, but tend to be strict on requiring a license.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As a result, reserving the right to issue electronic money to credit institutions is equivalent to inviting issuers of electronic money to adopt a certain corporate structure; it is not a way of creating a privilege for an existing group of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.63,0)">The Eurosystem has also insisted on the need for electronic money to be redeemable in bank money or in central bank money at par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As monetary history shows, public confidence in the currency is linked to this requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">V. The main policy issues today 21.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I now turn to the policy issues ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.27,0)">Those in which the Eurosystem and the ECB are likely to be involved in the coming months and beyond fall again under the three main headings of large-value payments, securities settlement systems, and retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.51,0)">22.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">On the large-value payments front, future work will primarily concern TARGET and is likely to concentrate on three issues:   technical improvements;   the establishment of closer relations with the users; and   the area of jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.25,0)">Technical improvements are necessary because in its first months of existence TARGET encountered some difficulties, mainly in the software, which interrupted the flow of cross-country payments on several occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.31,0)">Although these difficulties did not seem to damage the confidence of banks and became less frequent and less serious after the first two months of operations, their causes need to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The technical infrastructure of TARGET is composed of fifteen RTGS systems and fifteen Interlinking components, which have been developed under the responsibility of the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.99,0)">This heterogeneous nature of TARGET raises problems of both efficiency and cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.38,0)">Efficiency problems are due to the fact that any system with many interfaces is likely to encounter more frequent difficulties than a centralised system or a decentralised one with identical local components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.8,0)">Cost problems are primarily due to the fact that each time a modification has to be made to the TARGET software, it has to be made fifteen times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When TARGET was designed it was decided that harmonisation should be "minimal"   essentially because it would have taken too long to seek agreement on the design of a single TARGET component that could have been used by all NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.3,0)">Moreover, for many of them, this would have implied substantial losses, because their RTGS investments were recent   and far from being recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.14,0)">Finally the selection of countries participating in EMU was not done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As a matter of fact, when the Working Group I chaired agreed on the minimum approach in 1993 and 1994, the main reasons given were more practical than conceptual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Today, the same arguments relating to costs and efficiency which advised against substantial harmonisation in the preparatory phase of TARGET speak -in the operational phase of the system -in favour of this idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.98,0)">The minimalism of harmonisation may not be there for eternity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It will have to be reconsidered in the future and, over time, the various components of TARGET may converge towards a single model or, perhaps, even towards a unified infrastructure, as holds true of Fedwire and ELS, the German RTGS system, today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There has been as yet no special debate within the Eurosystem in this respect, but there is no doubt that the subject needs careful analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In any case, decisions about a unification in TARGET would, and should, not run counter to the principle of decentralisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In the TARGET environment decentralisation consists primarily in the exclusive account relationship that NCBs maintain with commercial banks in their respective countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">That principle is, and will remain, one of the building blocks of the Eurosystem's architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.9,0)">23.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Eurosystem-users relations will also need to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">During the preparatory phase of TARGET, NCBs were intermediaries between the banks and the working parties in charge of designing the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Although banks sometimes complained that they were not associated closely enough with the preparatory work for the system, this method proved efficient in allowing the key discussions to take place within the short time available for the design phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.69,0)">TARGET would probably not have been ready on time if banks had been involved more directly in the discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.93,0)">Today, the situation is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Banks need to re-discuss some of the existing TARGET rules in the light of experience, either to change them or to complement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The Eurosystem will be able to accommodate such requests over time, while firmly preserving its key objectives in terms of safety and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Fruitful discussions between banks and central banks can now start at the euro level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.16,0)">24.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Finally, the area of jurisdiction of TARGET is an issue for the following practical considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Twelve countries in central and Eastern Europe have applied to join the European Union and, later, to adopt the euro, and others may follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is not certain whether TARGET could cope in its present shape with the need to operate perhaps as many as 25 connections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">What is clear is that, once applicant countries join the euro, their banks will need to have equal access to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.2,0)">The enlargement of the European Union will therefore exacerbate the efficiency and cost problems already mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.95,0)">Moreover, most of the applicant countries are likely to process a low volume of payments and, if they have to build their connections to TARGET the way this has been done so far, they would probably never recover their costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">My conclusion is that the geographical extension of TARGET will require innovative solutions for the system as a whole or, at least, for the applicant countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">25.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.57,0)">I would now like to briefly consider three other issues closely related to, but not coincident with, large value payment problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first concerns the six other payment systems that continue to process large-value payments in the euro area in parallel with TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The multiplicity of large value payment systems is exceptional compared with that of other monetary areas where both market forces and policy makers led to a single system   or two systems  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It is possible that the present infrastructure in the euro area, which requires banks to divide their liquidity between several systems, will consolidate further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">However, the large-volume systems, which operate in parallel with TARGET, are very sound and, so far, have not caused segmentation of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For these reasons, the Eurosystem has no reservation against the fact that banks find the use of systems other than TARGET more convenient for some categories of payments, commercial payments in particular, for which immediate finality is not a compelling necessity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The only aspect on which the Eurosystem will continue to express reservations relates to the use of systems other than TARGET for the processing of very high value payments, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">more than EUR 500 million or even 1 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.35,0)">Processing such payments in systems other than TARGET gives rise to concerns about efficiency   and safety  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.54,0)">26.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second issue is the inauguration of the CLS Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For those who are not familiar with this development, let me give a little background.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">CLS stands for Continuous Linked Settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The CLS Bank will manage a settlement arrangement in which foreign exchange contracts are settled on a gross, "payment-versus-payment", basis in order to eliminate the so called "Herstatt risk", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.8,0)">the risk of a loss arising from the non delivery of one of the two legs of a two-currency transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.72,0)">For several years now, central banks had been pressing banks to find a solution to eliminate that risk, which has obvious systemic implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In response, a group of major international banks has developed CLS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">If successful  , this project will represent a major achievement for the banking sector and an example of good co-operation between banks and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The Eurosystem strongly supports the launch of CLS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">It is also happy to see that the euro is expected to be among the first group of eligible currencies to be settled in the CLS Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.97,0)">27.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The third issue concerns developments in the field of correspondent banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In principle, correspondent banking, like CLS, is also a mechanism that settles in commercial bank money because it is based on reciprocal services provided between banks operating in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.48,0)">It has hitherto been limited in scope and based on bilateral credit assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">Few systemic implications were involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Now, however, correspondent banking is evolving and becoming a special type of service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Major banks may now have hundreds of customers, and fund transfers can be settled directly on their books, by transfers from one account to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In the end, this development could lead to new kinds of fund transfer systems, with settlement taking place in commercial banks' money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is easily understandable that central banks, including the Eurosystem, will wish to evaluate the safety features of this evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.4,0)">28.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me now turn to securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.02,0)">In preparing for the start of Monetary Union, the Eurosystem had adopted a minimum approach for reasons of simplicity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This approach was based on the selection of those eligible securities settlement systems, which met the minimum standards mentioned above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">NCBs have maintained securities accounts with their local systems   for the delivery of local securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">For the delivery of foreign collateral  , they have developed CCBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">While it was sufficient to launch Monetary Union, such model may not remain the most efficient mechanism in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Alternative solutions such as the use of direct links between securities settlement systems have been envisaged and in some cases are already being used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Moreover, the possibility for NBCs to use accounts with central securities depositories located in other countries of the euro area, so-called remote access, is being considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me briefly discuss these two alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.65,0)">29.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The possibility of using direct links between securities settlement systems, whereby one securities settlement system becomes a participant in another, has already been approved by the Eurosystem, at the condition its minimum standards are met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">To date, as mentioned earlier, 26 such links have been approved and can be used for the collateralisation of the central bank's credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">About 20 more direct links are likely to be approved in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The next step will be to investigate under which conditions the Eurosystem could accept collateral delivered through the so-called indirect links, whereby two securities settlement systems use one or more custodian bank  or another securities settlement system as intermediary .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.78,0)">At the same time, the Eurosystem is investigating whether securities held in the books of custodian banks could also be used as collateral in its credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.53,0)">Answers to all these questions will no doubt have an impact on the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is, therefore, essential that the Eurosystem takes positions that are exclusively based on risk and efficiency considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.25,0)">30.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Remote access is also being studied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the present context, remote access refers to the possibility for NCBs of using accounts with securities settlement systems located in countries other than their own for settlement of their monetary policy or intraday credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">If such facility has not been used so far, it is because it was not deemed necessary within the framework of the minimum harmonisation approach, not because of safety or efficiency considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These aspects need now to be analysed in greater depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The results of this analysis are expected to become available by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">31.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The consolidation of securities settlement systems has yet to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Interbank cross-border transfers of securities in the euro area still rely extensively on the use of custodian banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">Custodian banks are to securities what correspondent banks are to payments: intermediaries that provide access facilities to a foreign settlement system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">But, contrary to what has happened on the payments side with the creation of TARGET, it has been difficult for banks to reduce the costs linked to the use of custodian banks in the euro area because the securities settlement system industry is still very fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Moreover, whereas the introduction of the single currency has eliminated the multiplicity of currencies within the Euroland, thereby reducing the need for traditional correspondent banking services, differences between national issuers still remain thereby increasing the fragmentation of the securities industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.25,0)">A consequence is that, even today, it is not easier for a euro area bank to settle trades in "bunds" than it is to settle trades in "gilts", although the first are denominated in euro and the second are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.45,0)">It is likely that the process of integration of the securities industry will affect also the activities of bank custodians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These activities tend to concentrate more and more in a very small number of big operators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">32.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Correspondent Central Banking Model, the use of links between securities settlement systems and remote access will not be sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Market participants want a further consolidation of the securities settlement system industry of the euro area in order to save costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">They have already made it clear that they want to be able to settle all their securities transactions in euro from a single gateway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is not very surprising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Securities settlement systems clearly represent what economic theory would call a natural monopoly and the euro area will see the same trend towards consolidation that has already been seen in individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Several projects have been developed so far to further consolidate the securities settlement industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It is not yet clear which single solution will emerge and how long it will take for it to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The segmentation in different systems has existed for so many years that a great deal of resistance can be expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem will not oppose the trend towards the consolidation of central securities depositories in Europe that the market requires.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It will remain neutral with respect to the competing formulas for consolidation and will leave it to market forces to decide the lines along which the restructuring should take place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Neutrality of the Eurosystem does not consist in giving "a bit to everyone".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It means, instead, defining clearly and openly the standards the central bank of the euro deems necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Neutrality of course requires that these standards are not modified to accommodate individual requests of some market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Once the market decides which model   prevails, the Eurosystem will be willing to discuss with the operators how best to deal with the risk issues involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.12,0)">33.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.19,0)">The third category of policy issues in which the Eurosystem is involved concerns the area of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">I have already indicated that, until recently and with the exception of electronic money, the Eurosystem had not paid much attention to this area, notwithstanding the responsibilities defined by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This attitude had to change because substantial improvements can no longer be delayed in the field of retail cross-border payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In a recently published report, the ECB Governing Council has set a number of objectives to be pursued by the banking community in order to improve the speed and cost conditions of retail cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.39,0)">The report also explains why the current low level of efficiency of retail cross-border payments in the euro area is indeed a source of concern for the ECB, identifies some causes of the problem and defines the Eurosystem's strategy and objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me elaborate a little bit more on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.39,0)">The current situation in the field of retail cross-border payments is not satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Although exchange rate risks have disappeared within the euro area, charges for such payments have not, as had been expected by consumers, decreased substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Whereas the fees charged to customers for domestic credit transfers rarely exceed between EUR 0.10 and EUR 0.20, the fees for most cross-border credit transfers come to between EUR 3.50 and EUR 26, with even higher peaks in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.36,0)">The speed of execution for domestic transfers is sometimes less than a day, whereas transfers on a cross-border basis typically take several days, occasionally even more than a week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The full benefits of Monetary Union will not be reaped by individuals and small enterprises until a payment between Milan and Munich is as efficient, secure and quick as a payment between Munich and Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">The euro area still has to become a single payment area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">34.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Several initiatives, including legislation, were taken with a view to abolishing the barriers to integrated payment systems within the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In particular, studies conducted by the EU Commission in 1993 and 1994 led to the adoption, in 1997, of the EU Parliament and Council Directive on cross-border credit transfers, which lays down common rules in the area of transparency and performance to the benefit of both end-customers and financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">EU Member States were due to implement this Directive by August 1999 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Important improvements in banks' practices should result from the implementation of the Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, since it applies to the whole of the European Union and is inspired by considerations related to the Single Market, that Directive could only address aspects that are specific to a multi-currency environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Customers within the euro area expect that greater benefits from the cross-border payment services become available to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">This expectation is a concern of the central bank of the euro, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.19,0)">the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.07,0)">The Eurosystem has identified several reasons, which explain why the gap between consumers' expectations and what the market is offering is still so wide in the area of cross-border retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.79,0)">They include the predominant use of correspondent banking and the lack of standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The gap, however, needs to shrink quickly to a more reasonable level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.63,0)">If it does not, confidence of citizens and businesses in Monetary Union will suffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem has come to the conclusion that, at least for the moment, it should work as a catalyst for change rather than increasing its operational involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This explains the publication of a series of objectives that the banking community is invited to meet by 2002 at the latest, when all the day-to-day transactions of the citizens of the euro area will be denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">VI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.68,0)">Conclusion 35.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I have looked at the process of restructuring of payment and securities settlements systems in Europe from a central banker's perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This process has not only been driven by technology and market forces, it has also been a response to the establishment of the Single Market and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">These two events have set in motion a fundamental transformation, that is far from complete, of the monetary and financial sector of Euroland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.03,0)">In the new environment, old national infrastructures could not remain; they need restructuring and consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The Eurosystem welcomes a process that will help reach all benefits that can be expected from financial and monetary integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Looking at the PSSS industry, the greatest advances have been made in the field of large-value payment systems, where many reforms have been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">National central banks and, since it was established, the Eurosystem have made their contribution to these reforms, in particular, through the creation of TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The trend towards consolidation in the securities settlement industry is a more recent phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In this area, market forces still need to find and develop those arrangements that meet the requirements of concentration and specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As long as market forces do not lead to unsound or inefficient solutions, the Eurosystem will not influence the trend towards consolidation of the central securities depositories in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In the field of retail payments, substantial efforts are required to make cross-border payments as efficient, secure and quick as domestic payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">For the European citizens and businesses, the euro area still has to become a single payment area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The Eurosystem has recently set targets for the banking industry that may help it reach that objective within a reasonable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The responsibility of the Eurosystem is to ensure that the vast restructuring process of the industry takes place in a way that preserves the safety and the smooth functioning of payment and securities settlement systems and increases their efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The future accession of central and eastern countries to the EU and, later, Monetary Union will make the current process even more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Within its field of responsibility, the Eurosystem stands ready to address this challenge.</span>
