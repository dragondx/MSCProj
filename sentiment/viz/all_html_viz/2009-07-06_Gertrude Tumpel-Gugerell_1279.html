    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)"> Implementing SEPA: our expedition to a fully integrated euro retail payment market Keynote speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell,Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the IEA & Marketforce’s 2nd Annual Conference “The Future of Cards and Payments”London, 6 July 2009 Ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure today to update you on where we stand in our expedition to a fully integrated euro retail payment market – the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">A successful expedition calls for a good combination of exploratory spirit, a sense of orientation and determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">Sometimes just one single person can possess this combination of qualities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Take Captain James Cook, for example: not far from our venue, in front of Admiralty Arch, you will find a statue in memory of this famous British explorer, navigator and cartographer, who died 230 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Captain Cook undertook three major journeys; likewise, the SEPA challenge comprises three stages: the SEPA Credit Transfer   scheme, the SEPA Direct Debit   scheme and SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The players in the European banking industry have joined forces to establish SEPA and successfully reached the first stage of this demanding but very promising journey – the introduction of the SEPA Credit Transfer scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">We cannot, of course, hide the fact that a lot of stakeholders – including the Eurosystem – would have appreciated a faster adoption of SEPA by both providers and customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.98,0)">The adoption of the SCT scheme has started, but progress remained slow throughout 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">However, recent figures give reason to hope that the dead calm is coming to an end and that a fresh breeze is ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The latest figures give a clear indication that SEPA has reached the tipping point: it is now being used for more than just cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Therefore, there is a confident hope that the adoption rate might accelerate further in the near future, especially when we take into consideration the plans of the respective public authorities to adhere to the SCT scheme later this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This momentum will be further accelerated by the introduction of the SDD scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Forward-looking and European-thinking banks and infrastructures will already be offering SDD by November 2009 while others have up to a year in which to sign up to the scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Thanks to the reviewed regulation on cross-border payments, banks offering legacy direct debits in euro will definitely be introducing SDD by November 2010 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This will motivate a lot of companies to finally set sail and start implementing SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.01,0)">The outcome of the third stage of the SEPA journey, SEPA for cards, is perhaps the most uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The Eurosystem continues to encourage market participants to introduce a European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Joint research by the European Central Bank   and De Nederlandsche Bank shows that the launch of a new European card scheme could provide the impetus for solving the problem of interoperability and overcoming the costly fragmentation of the European card market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Consumers and merchants are likely to benefit most from SEPA when sufficient competition in the card payment market alleviates any potential monopolistic tendencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The ECB appreciates, therefore, the different initiatives that have a European card scheme as their destination and welcomes the travel preparations made by them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.01,0)">That said, we should not lose sight of our objective by starting even more initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Instead, the projects that have already taken off are invited to get down to business and perhaps combine forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Now is the time to come up with concrete travel plans, including defining and committing to milestones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Perhaps it is not by chance that the British Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit is located in Admiralty Arch, with the statue of Captain Cook in front of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With everything that we hope to achieve for SEPA in the short and medium term, we must not lose sight of the broad SEPA strategy and our long-term objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The objectives of greater harmonisation and increased innovation In the past, the main reasons for exploration at sea were political as well as commercial, such as the discovery of new trade routes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.64,0)">However, Captain Cook’s voyages in particular had an explicitly scientific purpose, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The aim of his first journey, for example, was to observe and record the transit of Venus across the Sun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">SEPA is a project driven by business as well as politics and is also gaining more and more academic attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">A research conference held recently at the ECB found that a fundamental relationship exists between the retail payment business and overall banking performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">There is academic evidence that, in countries with more developed retail payment markets, the banks perform better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This relationship is stronger in countries which have adopted a relatively high number of technologies for retail payment transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Starting in the 15th century, the Age of Discovery was characterised by increased competition among explorers in order to be the first to discover the last remaining uncharted waters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">A by-product of this was that innovations in sailing ship technologies, the creation of new maps and advances in astronomy were achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the same way, competition is an important contributor to innovation and efficiency in the field of retail payments, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">According to academic research, consumers in a very competitive retail payment market benefit from more choice, quicker execution of payments and greater efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Competition among retail payment instruments fosters innovation and may also encourage retail payment providers to improve their services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a result, banks also perform better in such a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Furthermore, greater use of electronic retail payment instruments seems to stimulate banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At a time when banks are having to reconsider their business models in light of the current financial market developments, these are promising results and should even motivate us to strengthen our joint efforts to achieve a real Single Euro Payments Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Retail payments could well prove to be the banks’ trade route out of the rough sea that they are currently having to navigate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Therefore, the SEPA objective of harmonisation is of sustained importance and the European Payments Council   is encouraged to proceed with its efforts in realising this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So far the EPC has been focusing mainly on core and basic payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This approach was necessary in order to establish a SEPA-wide framework within a reasonable amount of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The final service offered should, of course, go beyond these basic products, since customers will set the benchmark at the level of service of the legacy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.3,0)">However, this should not prevent providers and users from making a thorough analysis of their business processes and adapting them to suit their new SEPA environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In addition, the EPC should also pay increased attention to the standardisation of the customer-bank interface.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The basic SEPA instruments that the European banking industry has delivered so far should provide the foundations on which to build a more innovative retail payment market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I expect more innovative products based on the core SEPA instruments, such as e-payments or m-payments, to emerge onto the market sooner rather than later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Flexible and innovative service providers are the most likely to succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Banks and infrastructures have to be open to new payment instruments in the electronic and mobile environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Otherwise, as we can already see happening, third parties will step in and fill the gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The EPC is encouraged, therefore, to intensify its work on mobile and electronic payments, and banks are encouraged to adopt the solutions developed by the EPC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We must start preparing now for the future and think beyond the borders of our current payment behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">All these efforts to foster harmonisation and innovation will contribute to reducing the persistent fragmentation of the European payment market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">History has indicated that a tendency towards national retrenchment may increase in times of uncertainty and the recent crisis has indeed confirmed this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Currently the state of our financial integration shows some signs of segmentation along national borders, particularly with regard to the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Thus, it is important not to forget that integrated financial markets can help financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">They offer their participants a more efficient environment than a market divided by national borders ever could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Integrated markets are more liquid and offer better opportunities for risk diversification, thereby reinforcing the system’s capacity to absorb shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Therefore, financial integration is directly linked to our objective of improving market resilience and also contributes to financial stability in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">As cross-border financial risks are becoming more and more important in Europe, we need to remain firmly committed to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">For this, the further integration of the retail payment market is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.5,0)">However, a persistent debate surrounds this integration process: who is the navigator on our SEPA journey?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.97,0)">Barriers to self-regulation – regulatory needs Retail payments have traditionally been off the radar screen of most of the central banks, except from the perspective of pure oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Now, however, not only in Europe, but also in other regions, the crucial role of retail banking and payments in an efficient overall economy has been recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Therefore, central banks have decided to strengthen their role as a catalyst for change and the fostering of integration and innovation in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">I have persistently emphasised that SEPA continues to be a mainly self-regulated project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.73,0)">However, we must not underestimate the limitations of self-regulation and the thin line between cooperative and competitive space.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.42,0)">There are elements which the market will not be able to accomplish on its own and which need more regulatory involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">That is why the ECB has been increasingly involved as a moderator for the past few months in order to keep SEPA successfully on course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Take, for example, the discussion on the multilateral interchange fee for direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">After intensive discussions with market participants, the European Commission, together with the ECB, has provided clarity on this controversial issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The transitional provisions published by the ECB and the European Commission in September 2008 have been integrated into the amended regulation on cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Beyond these transitional provisions, banks requested additional guidance regarding the long-term business model for SDD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Consequently, in March 2009 the European Commission and the ECB published a joint statement providing further clarification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, it has been made clear that, for reasons of efficiency, a general per transaction multilateral interchange fee for national and SEPA direct debit transactions does not seem justified, nor would it be compatible with EU antitrust rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.29,0)">Another example of where self-regulation might not be the best solution is the question of the migration end-date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Although we have successfully started out on our journey to SEPA, we have not yet determined our date of arrival.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The Eurosystem has emphasised that an ambitious and yet realistic end-date for migration to SCT and SDD is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Recent experiences with cash support the need to set a migration end-date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.56,0)">Despite several attempts to make dollar coins popular, customer acceptance has been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One of the major reasons given is that the 1 dollar bill was not simultaneously phased out with the introduction of the 1 dollar coin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The UK has been successful in introducing the 1 £ coin several years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">When the first 12 European countries introduced euro cash each country defined a transitional period for the parallel use of the euro and the national currency, based on the maximum time frame set by the EU legislator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A common migration end-date across Europe should, however, give national communities the possibility of setting earlier dates at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Setting an end-date for SEPA migration would facilitate communication and provide more certainty for all stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The most viable option for determining a migration end-date is through regulation by public authorities, for instance by way of an EU regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The Eurosystem appreciates the fact that the European Commission has launched a public consultation on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some people are of the opinion that, with the guidance given by the European Commission and the ECB on multilateral interchange fees for direct debits and the possible regulation of an end-date for SEPA migration, there is no room for self-regulation any more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.14,0)">Or, in other words, that there is no reason for the EPC to exist any more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I could not disagree more!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The guidance provided on the multilateral interchange fees for direct debits and the possible setting of a migration end-date are necessary in order to allow the EPC’s self-regulation to function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.06,0)">In other words, without this well-targeted public intervention, the SEPA project could have come to a halt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Therefore, for the Eurosystem, it is not a case of either self-regulation or outside regulation; rather, both should exist in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The question of governance Amid all our ambitions to foster a more integrated and innovative market, we must focus on the customer even more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Both policy-makers and the financial services industry should be focusing on the customers’ needs and benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">After all, the financial industry has a legitimate interest in its products being used and accepted by its customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">In its Sixth Progress Report on SEPA in November 2008, the Eurosystem emphasised that the success of SEPA depends greatly on adequate governance of the project and stressed that such good governance arrangements should aim to involve different stakeholders and provide transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">In more concrete terms, there is a difference between the governance of the EPC and the governance of the overall European retail payment market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Although the EPC plays an important – even crucial – role in the emergence of SEPA, it cannot be held accountable for the European retail payment market in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let us first discuss the governance of the EPC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">So far the EPC has done a good job, by publishing its rulebooks and recently also providing summaries of its industry discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, more information could be provided on the EPC’s planning and how it deals with changes requested by stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">Let me be clear: without a credible and decisive EPC, an integrated European retail payment market is hardly imaginable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Therefore, in my view, the EPC should continue to play a central role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As an executive body of payment service providers, it should define the common rules and standards for the European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In such a way, and in line with our statements in our progress reports, the EPC should continue to work on improving its own governance arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The EPC has the power to involve stakeholders and consult them on its deliverables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The recently launched Cards Stakeholder Forum is a step in the right direction, even if the exact structure of the group warrants further discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There are lessons to be learned from what happens at the national level when attention is paid to the needs of the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The governance of payment systems requires transparent processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Major changes to payment schemes should be subject to transparent evaluation, weighing up the costs and benefits to the banking industry and to society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This leads me directly from the governance of the EPC to the governance of the overall European retail payment market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To put it in the context of Captain Cook: we need a captain; and we need to make the tasks of this captain clear before the end of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We can learn from the experience of the Payments Council in the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The governance of the European retail payment market also entails a more social, strategic and political dimension to retail payments, which, by definition, cannot be handled by a self-regulating body of banks or payment service providers alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In some countries, best practices have emerged in the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In addition to the coordination on the “supply side”, which is the role that the EPC plays at the European level, national fora have emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These fora deal with the more social and political elements of the retail payment market, and we need to represent this to a certain extent at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">A new European forum could promote the goals of SEPA in the context of the evolving landscape of the European retail payment market by: firstly, ensuring appropriate coordination and dialogue with national structures during the migration process; secondly, promoting innovative solutions in line with the objectives of the Lisbon agenda; and finally, being transparent as regards end-users and all relevant stakeholders and involving them as market partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The creation of a European forum does not, however, dilute the continued importance of the EPC, now or in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The European retail payment market will benefit considerably from a strong EPC and an additional European forum dealing with the social, strategic and political aspects of the retail payment market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Conclusion In conclusion, allow me to re-emphasise that the SEPA ship has left the harbour destined for a fully integrated market for euro retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The compass is set for a full Single Euro Payments Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The Eurosystem appreciates the efforts of those banks that are committed to launching SDD in November 2009 and we encourage all the others to follow suit as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The projects for the introduction of an additional European card scheme are invited to increase their efforts and publish their concrete itineraries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Payment services have stood solid as a rock throughout the turbulence of the recent months and it has been widely acknowledged that retail payments will be a cornerstone of banks’ business in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Therefore, it is even more important that our journey to SEPA will succeed – despite the periods of nearly stand still and turbulences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Competition, standardisation, innovation and the right level of regulation are the key factors contributing to a favourable outcome.</span>
