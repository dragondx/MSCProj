    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Presentation of the ECB’s Annual Report 2008 to the European Parliament Introductory statement by Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the ECBto the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary AffairsStrasbourg, 21 April 2009 Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a privilege for me to present to you the Annual Report of the European Central Bank   for 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This presentation is an essential element of the ECB’s democratic accountability and is therefore of the greatest value for us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my introductory remarks, I will first briefly review the economic and monetary developments over the past year, present our current assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and explain our monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will then focus on a number of topical policy issues, in particular those pertaining to financial stability and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But before doing so, I would like to highlight some important events that have taken place over the previous 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Last year the ECB, and at the beginning of this year the euro, celebrated their tenth anniversaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We can look back at the past ten years with pride, and we can justifiably say that the euro has been a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We have delivered a stable and credible currency that enjoys the confidence of now 329 million fellow citizens in 16 EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the citizens of Slovakia on having joined the euro area at the beginning of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The continuing enlargement of the euro area shows that Monetary Union is not a “closed shop”; it remains open to newcomers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">However, even if the reasons for celebration are manifold, there is no room for complacency, as the challenging economic situation and outlook amply demonstrate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Economic developments and monetary policy For the euro area, 2008 was an exceptional year characterised by severe and increasing financial market tensions as well as by significant and abrupt changes in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">Following strong economic growth in the first quarter, economic conditions worsened progressively, especially after the extraordinary intensification of the financial turmoil in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">For the year as a whole, real GDP in the euro area grew modestly, by 0.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.46,0)">The latest available information suggests that in the first quarter of 2009 aggregate output recorded a further sizeable decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.63,0)">We expect economic activity in the euro area to remain weak for the remainder of 2009 and to gradually recover in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Taking into account the effects of the substantial macroeconomic stimulus in progress and the measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system, the risks to this outlook are assessed to be broadly balanced over the medium term, but uncertainty remains unusually high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">As regards price developments, annual HICP inflation averaged 3.3% in 2008, which is much higher than in the previous two years and significantly above the ECB’s definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.47,0)">However, headline inflation rates fluctuated sharply in the course of the year, peaking at 4.0% in June and July, mainly as a result of developments in international commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.35,0)">During the second half of 2008, annual inflation declined steadily and rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.56,0)">In March 2009, it stood at 0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.1,0)">By contrast, HICP inflation excluding energy and food posted a much smaller decline in 2008 and early 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.87,0)">Looking ahead, HICP inflation is likely to remain well below 2% in 2009 and may reach negative levels around mid-year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.99,0)">Such a phenomenon is expected to be temporary, driven mainly by base effects from past energy price developments, and would not constitute an episode of deflation, that is, a protracted period of decline in the price level that can adversely affect inflation expectations and aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.73,0)">Looking at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, HICP inflation is in 2010 expected to rise again but remain below 2%, reflecting mainly ongoing sluggish economic activity in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Monetary policy has been conducted in an extraordinary and rapidly changing economic and financial environment over the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the first half of 2008, strong increases in commodity prices accompanied by signs of rising wage pressures and an upward drift of inflation expectations implied that risks to price stability over the medium term were increasingly on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">To counteract these upside risks and ensure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, the Governing Council of the ECB raised its key interest rates by 25 basis points in July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.9,0)">With the intensification of the financial turmoil from mid-September last year, the macroeconomic situation and outlook changed fundamentally and suddenly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.64,0)">As the financial crisis deepened and broadened, global demand and economic activity weakened substantially, commodity prices declined markedly and, as a result, inflationary pressures and risks in the euro area diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.8,0)">Monetary growth and the expansion of credit to the private sector decelerated, confirming that upside risks to price stability were abating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.16,0)">In response, the Governing Council lowered the key ECB interest rates decisively, by an unprecedented 300 basis points between October 2008 and April 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The Governing Council will continue to do what is necessary to preserve price stability and ensure the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over medium to longer-term horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and also contributes to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Let me also stress that, from the onset of the financial market tensions, the ECB has taken forceful action in its liquidity management, also through non-conventional measures, to make sure that banks are able to refinance themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Our policy-making has been in a “non-standard mode” for a considerable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In October last year, we adopted a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment for all main refinancing operations and longer-term refinancing operations with maturities of up to six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In addition, the ECB expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a result, the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet has increased substantially during the financial turmoil, by around €600 billion between June 2007 and March 2009, mainly reflecting the expansion of liquidity provision to the banking system since last autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This is of particular significance for the euro area because the banking system plays a more important role in the financing of the private sector than in other major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.22,0)">At the same time, owing to the ECB’s liquidity management, overnight money market rates have fallen even more steeply than the key ECB interest rates since last October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.1,0)">Money market rates in the euro area are now very low, also in an international comparison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Overall, the provision and management of liquidity by the ECB have played a crucial role in the implementation of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">They have ensured that banks have adequate access to central bank funding so as to continue financing the economy and that liquidity constraints and perceived risks have not triggered a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The ECB will continue to foster the orderly functioning of money markets and the intermediation of funds by the banking system by taking appropriate measures, be they standard or non-standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">At the same time, the medium-term orientation of our monetary policy provides a clear and unambiguous signpost that will allow us to pursue a credible exit strategy from the current conditions of very low interest rates and extraordinary short-term liquidity support as the economic situation normalises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.35,0)">Fiscal policies The economic downturn, discretionary fiscal measures to stimulate economic activity and government intervention to support the financial sector have had a substantial impact on public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">According to the European Commission’s January 2009 interim forecast, which is cited in the ECB’s Annual Report, the euro area general government deficit was expected to increase from 1.7% of GDP in 2008 to 4.0% in 2009 and 4.4% in 2010, with ten euro area countries forecast to be above the 3% of GDP reference value in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.45,0)">More recent information indicates an even stronger fiscal deterioration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.32,0)">The current focus of fiscal policy on economic recovery is certainly warranted; but this should not undermine the integrity of the EU fiscal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Especially in challenging times such as these, it is crucial to preserve the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This requires that governments are credibly committed to achieving sound fiscal positions as soon as possible and to fully applying the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, which provides sufficient flexibility to deal with adverse economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Financial stability and supervision Let me now focus on the financial sector and issues related to its regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.65,0)">The synchronised deceleration in activity in all economies has added to the stresses on the financial system in Europe and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.83,0)">The weakening of economic activity has impaired the quality of bank loans, which has adversely affected banks’ capital positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.69,0)">As financial institutions continue to deleverage their balance sheets, they reduce their securities holdings and tighten the credit standards applied to new loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.88,0)">This feeds back to the real economy and in turn constrains the ability of the private sector to service its debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.94,0)">Therefore, there are emerging signs of a negative feedback loop between the real economy and the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Initially, the banking system in Europe faced the financial turmoil with solvency positions generally well above regulatory minimum requirements, following several years of strong profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.58,0)">However, as the financial market tensions intensified in the autumn of 2008, banks’ balance sheets came under significant pressure, as the values of structured finance products declined further, securitisation activity came to a virtual standstill, credit losses started to rise and income from fees and commissions as well as trading dropped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.49,0)">As a result, the banking sector has been facing significant challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.05,0)">For example, the declared cumulated write-downs and credit-market losses of European banks so far   amount to almost USD 358 billion – of which euro area institutions account for less than USD 173 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">At the same time, a total of USD 382 billion of fresh capital has been raised by European banks, while capital newly injected into euro area banks has reached USD 190 billion, thus exceeding the declared losses and write-downs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.15,0)">Unfortunately, more write-downs can be expected in the coming quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.94,0)">The total write-downs of banks globally since the eruption of the turmoil are estimated by the International Monetary Fund to reach USD 2.8 trillion, of which USD 737 billion would be borne by European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These estimates depend on the underlying projection of the path of economic activity and assumptions about future asset market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.49,0)">Coping with this stress will pose a particular challenge for financial institutions – and this at a time when their shock-absorbing capacity has already been severely tested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.53,0)">A number of risks lie ahead, stemming from the external environment, notably a deeper and more prolonged recession in advanced economies, as well from the subdued economic activity in the euro area and its effect on banks’ balance sheets, notably on the quality of loans to non-financial corporations, as well as to the commercial and residential property sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.42,0)">Moreover, financial markets – despite recent positive developments in equity markets worldwide – remain vulnerable to swings in investor confidence and risk aversion, which could adversely affect liquidity and asset prices in some markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Against the background of these very difficult conditions, significant policy measures have been taken by central banks and governments in Europe to improve market liquidity and replenish capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Governments created schemes for guaranteeing new bank debt, injected capital and, more recently, provided asset relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These measures were successful in preventing a meltdown of financial systems and they helped to bolster confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The Eurosystem provided important input into the design of these measures, in the form of recommendations aimed at ensuring that such measures would help to safeguard financial stability and restore the provision of credit to the private sector, while at the same time maintaining a level playing-field within the Single Market to the maximum extent possible, and also containing their impact on public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It is still early to accurately assess the impact of these government measures on the longer-term funding and the recapitalisation of banks as well as their effectiveness in fostering bank lending to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.45,0)">This is because the evidence is relatively limited, as the implementation of the measures has been gradual over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.49,0)">Moreover, it is difficult at this stage to disentangle the positive impact of the bank support measures from the effects of other developments, notably those related to the deteriorating economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.77,0)">The causes and contributing factors of the financial turbulence are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.2,0)">The crisis revealed several weaknesses in the financial system, but it has also highlighted inadequacies in the current system of prudential supervision and oversight that prevented the nature and magnitude of the accumulating risks from being identified in good time and appropriate remedial action from being taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">At the initiative of the European Commission, the group chaired by Jacques de Larosière undertook a comprehensive review of the EU framework for financial supervision and proposed, among other innovations, the creation of a European Systemic Risk Council with responsibility for macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The ECB welcomes the group’s report and broadly supports its recommendations for macro-prudential supervision, as well as the related communication issued by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The proposed establishment of the Systemic Risk Council under the auspices of the ECB and the Council’s composition are a recognition of the extensive analytical capabilities developed by central banks in the fields of monetary and financial-stability analysis, their relevant expertise, and their closeness to the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The work of the Council will also benefit from the use of the technical infrastructure already in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The ECB and the entire European System of Central Banks stand ready to assume the macro-prudential supervision tasks envisaged in the report by the de Larosière Group and to provide the necessary analytical and logistical support to the Systemic Risk Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">For the new Council to function effectively, three key requirements will need to be fulfilled: First, in order to identify and assess the risks and vulnerabilities in the EU financial system as a whole, to issue risk warnings and to adopt related macro-prudential policy recommendations, the Systemic Risk Council will need to have an information base that draws on both macro- and micro-prudential supervisory information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This will allow the use of all relevant information for assessing, among other things, the “interconnectedness” of financial institutions and markets and its implications for financial system stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.24,0)">Close cooperation and well-functioning information-sharing mechanisms between the new Council, micro-prudential supervisors and the proposed European System of Financial Supervision will therefore be indispensible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Second, adequate institutional mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that the risk warnings and the related recommendations issued by the Systemic Risk Council are translated into effective action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.58,0)">The days when risk warnings were issued and very few listened – or wanted to listen – should be over!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Third, for the Systemic Risk Council to be effective, legitimate and independent in its decision-making, a solid legal basis is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Such a basis will also provide legal clarity regarding the necessary access to EU-wide macro-prudential information as well as to supervisory data concerning individual institutions, subject to adequate confidentiality arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The next steps towards the implementation of the de Larosière Group proposals will require a number of legal, institutional and organisational issues to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In this regard, the ECB stands ready to contribute to the necessary preparations in a constructive and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">We look forward to the communication from the European Commission and the decision of the European Council in June that will lay the foundations of a new system of macro-prudential supervision in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Speedy progress towards that goal is of the essence, for the strengthening of macro-prudential supervision in Europe is an important and urgent policy objective – and one which the members of this Committee have strongly supported in a consistent and, indeed, visionary manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">* * Madam Chair, honourable members of the Committee, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Executive Board and the Governing Council for our enriching exchanges of views over the past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.0,0)">Owing to the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, today’s presentation of our Annual Report is the last before your Committee in its current composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I have always appreciated your cooperation and our fruitful dialogue.</span>
