    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> Charting a new global landscape: the growing impact of emerging markets on the world economy Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB75th anniversary of the central bank of the Republic of TurkeyAnkara, 1 June 2007 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Today is an important day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We are here to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the central bank of the Republic of Turkey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Let me congratulate you warmly on this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">But today is an important day for me too, as my institution, the European Central Bank, is also celebrating its birthday!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Well, we are a bit younger…we are turning nine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This means that next year it will be our turn and pleasure to host events in Frankfurt to mark our tenth anniversary!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Perhaps one issue of common interest we could discuss today is how our two institutions may, in the words of Cicero, “support the burden of advancing age”!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.58,0)">But this is not the homework you had assigned me to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I have come here today to talk about the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">We are all witnessing its rapid development, the profound changes it is undergoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">And one of the most important changes, the consequences of which still remain to be understood fully, is the growing role of emerging countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">This group of economies is not easy to define, I admit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The term “emerging countries” was coined by the World Bank more than a quarter of a century ago, but it only started to become popular in the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">This is hardly a coincidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Following the debt crises of the 1980s, a number of rapidly developing economies gained, or regained, access to international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">These economies have liberalised their financial systems, at least in part, and have become broadly accessible to foreign investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">From a handful of such economies, in particular in East Asia, the circle has gradually grown to include several countries in Latin America, central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, as well as a few countries in Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Since the turn of the millennium, new acronyms have appeared, such as “BRICs”, which refers to the largest emerging markets, to the economies that are expected to become the giants of the 21st century, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Turkey is, in turn, one of the most important emerging market countries as illustrated by its participation in the Group of Twenty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Turkey is also one of the main players in emerging financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">For instance, its international debt is among the most liquid, accounting for as much as 10% of the emerging bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The strong capital inflows that Turkey has attracted over the past few years, some USD 100 billion since the turn of the millennium, underline the interest of foreign investors in the economy’s record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">When discussing emerging markets nowadays, it is an attempt to understand how the global economy is changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Therefore, it is also an attempt to understand what the world will be like tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I would like to share some of my thoughts on these developments with you, with particular regard to three aspects: first, the weight of the emerging markets, which is already significant and is likely to grow further; second, the implications of the rise of the emerging markets for the world economy, some of which is already in evidence; and third, the implications of this rise for us, in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I shall now review these three aspects in turn, before drawing some conclusions on the governance of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Current and prospective weight of the emerging markets Consider first the economic weight of emerging market countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">As we know, it is significant, increasingly significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These countries constitute over half of the world’s population, with China and India alone accounting for over one third.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.19,0)">Due to the profound economic transformations ongoing, many of these economies are faced with rapid urbanisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">To date, seven of the ten largest metropolitan areas in the world are located in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The combined population of three of these metropolitan areas, Mexico City, São Paulo and Mumbai, is as large as that of my home country, France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">And we know that Istanbul ranks among the largest cities in the world, with a population of over 11 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The numbers are also increasingly impressive in terms of economic size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Emerging markets account for almost 40% of world GDP at purchasing power parity, and 20% at market value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And if these economies are already large, they are also growing rapidly, at about 7% per annum on average over the past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Turkey has been growing at a similarly rapid pace, while the most economically vigorous region of the world, emerging Asia, has been growing even faster, at close to 8% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This makes emerging markets one of the main engines of world growth, with a contribution of over one half last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Emerging countries’ citizens have reaped the benefits of such rapid development with higher standards of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Over the last decade, GDP per capita has risen by 30% on average, to reach over USD 9,000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The integration of emerging economies into global markets of goods and services has been similarly swift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">If you look at the world exports of goods and services, the combined share of emerging markets doubled between the early 1990s and 2006, to reach roughly 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But these are well-known macroeconomic facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Perhaps even more striking is the microeconomic evidence of the economic success of both companies and individuals in emerging markets, which is sometimes unprecedented in terms of rapidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me give you a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Four companies among the world’s 20 largest in terms of market value originate from emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Two oil and gas firms, one Russian and one Chinese, rank in the top ten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Moreover, according to Forbes, seven of the 20 richest individuals in the world are from the emerging markets, with three from India alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In 2005, there were more than 300,000 millionaires   in China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This seems to be already more than in Canada or in Australia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">However, that is not to say that the challenges posed by income distribution are not among the highest priorities of most emerging market countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As we know, eliminating poverty is on the top of the agenda for developing countries, in particular for Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">If the present looks promising for emerging market economies, their potential future seems even brighter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What do the available projections for long-term growth, based on demographic trends and models of capital accumulation and productivity, tell us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.16,0)">The answer is no surprise: emerging markets are likely to become even weightier in the world economy tomorrow than they are today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.98,0)">Of course, any projection, even in the short term, is surrounded by uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.99,0)">Projections at very distant horizons are, therefore, somewhat speculative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Yet, they might capture possible secular developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">A number of studies found startling results regarding the growth prospects of emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">According to one such study, Brazil, Russia, India and China could account for over half the size of today’s six largest economies by 2025 and, in less than 40 years, they could be larger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Other studies convey similar messages, notwithstanding some differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Therefore, the developments we observe today are likely to be the precursor of a profound rebalancing in the distribution of world output tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.46,0)">Of course, it cannot be excluded that this process might well be “non-linear”, with episodes of discontinuity, perhaps also including financial crises somewhere down the line.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Therefore, the current developments call for constant monitoring and cooperation in the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But let me also look at emerging markets from a different angle, an angle which is more uncommon for a central banker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">These countries are not only growing in importance economically, but also culturally – a dimension which is, for sure, interlinked with the economic one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Take film-making as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In 2005, the largest world producer of films was India, with over 900 films, ahead of the European Union, with about 800, and the United States, with about 700.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Other emerging markets, such as China and Russia, ranked among the top ten film producers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Turkey was within the top 20, with 27 films.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Consider the internet as a second example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The internet plays a crucial role in making the world more global, and here too the weight of emerging markets is already impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There are already around 16 million internet users in Turkey, corresponding to about one fifth of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Excluding Japan, Asia has the highest number of internet users, with over 310 million users, ahead of North America, with 230 million users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are almost as many internet users in China and India   as in the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Take finally the number of Nobel prizes awarded, which reward the highest achievements in science, literature and peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Here again, emerging markets seem to be growing in importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Back in the 1980s, 24 nationals from emerging market countries were awarded a Nobel prize.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Within only six years of the new millennium, this figure is already almost as high  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">All in all, the growth in the economic weight of emerging economies and nations and the rise in their cultural importance are very much synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The implications of the rise of the emerging markets for the world economy Consider now my second point: the implications of the rise of the emerging markets for the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Of course, this impact is multifaceted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It spans two areas of immediate interest for central bankers, namely global inflation and global capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.92,0)">Take inflation first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.24,0)">The integration into the global economy of a massive pool of low-cost, skilled workers from emerging markets has tended to exert downward pressure on import prices of manufactured goods and on wage demands in mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Indeed, in a very short space of time, the available labour force in the global economy has doubled from 1.5 to 3 billion, reflecting the opening up of China, India and the former Soviet bloc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.69,0)">As a consequence, the price of a wide range of manufactured goods has declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.8,0)">In addition, through various channels, this process of wage moderation and reduced inflationary pressure in the manufacturing sector has affected wage dynamics also in the services sector, mainly as a result of outsourcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Altogether, these effects have helped dampen inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.79,0)">This is what the figures seem to tell us: on the basis of a simple accounting method, the ECB’s staff estimated that the larger imports from low-cost countries had a dampening effect on overall euro area manufacturing import prices of around two percentage points per annum, on average, between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.36,0)">Yet there are other, opposing forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.59,0)">Certain resources have become relatively scarcer given the increasing demand from emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In particular, the strong growth seen in some of the largest economies, notably China and India, has likely contributed to recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, as well as of food products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.18,0)">Accordingly, this may have been a source of upward pressure on inflation over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.45,0)">Arguably, it is difficult to make an exact assessment of this contribution, as commodity prices are also affected by supply conditions and geopolitical factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, according to one study, the rapid growth in emerging countries and their increasing share in world trade and GDP may have contributed to an increase in oil prices by as much as 40%, and real metal prices by as much as 10% in the first five years of the new millennium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This illustrates why it is important for central bankers to do what is needed to avoid what are known as “second-round effects” and to anchor inflation expectations through forward-looking monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.04,0)">All in all, it is difficult to measure accurately the total impact of emerging markets on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">For instance, the IMF’s staff has estimated that globalisation, through its direct effects on non-oil import prices, has reduced inflation by a quarter of a percentage point per year, on average, in mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">However, the overall impact is more difficult to estimate and disentangle from other factors that reduce inflation, for instance the increases in productivity growth and the stronger credibility of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Take now international capital flows, the other dimension for which the growing role of emerging markets has a clear global effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Certain emerging markets, notably in Asia and among oil exporters, have become the “financiers of the world”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">They are indeed large net savers, with hefty current account surpluses, in the order of USD 800 billion last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Interestingly, the net capital outflows from these emerging markets finance the deficits of a number of mature economies, the United States, in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Of course, many emerging economies remain external borrowers, Turkey being one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">But for the first time in modern history, the “southern hemisphere” is overall financing the “northern hemisphere”: capital is flowing from the “poorer” economies to the “richer” economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.57,0)">This looks abnormal both from an economic standpoint and from a moral standpoint: according to standard economic theory, capital should flow in the opposite direction, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">from “richer” to “poorer” economies, where the expected rate of return of capital is higher; and it would be more appropriate for the wealthiest economies to save more and consume less, in proportion, than the poorest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.14,0)">There is much debate among economists as to how to explain this “paradox”, which is sometimes referred to in connection with the 1995 Nobel prize winner in economics, Robert Lucas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Of course, there are many factors to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.75,0)">One recent explanation is that the current constellation of global financial flows is partly due to the still “incomplete” nature of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Trade integration has indeed preceded financial integration, particularly in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A sound and deep financial system cannot be created overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">If you look at mature economies, even there financial technology and infrastructure have taken a very long time to develop so as to overcome thorny problems posed by information asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.48,0)">Now, one implication of the absence of a modern financial system in many emerging markets is precisely that it helps explain the current “unorthodox’’ constellation of global financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Since the locally underdeveloped financial systems are not sufficiently capable of channelling savings internally, this gives rise to net capital flows from emerging to mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">According to this view, an important factor in the adjustment of the existing global imbalances therefore resides in the deepening of financial systems in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">According to another interpretation of the “Lucas paradox”, which would certainly complement the previous one, the majority of emerging economies are still taking out insurance against the risk of financial crisis of the type that they encountered over the past 25 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.23,0)">During the Mexican crisis in 1982, and the global crisis of sovereign emerging borrowers in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as the Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s, emerging economies were exposed to sharp and abrupt financial crises calling for challenging macroeconomic adjustments of their domestic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the same period, the industrialised countries were protected from any such domestic crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Substantial current account deficits were very easily financed, such that the external financial constraint did not materialise in those economies in any significant fashion in the period under review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.6,0)">This may also help to explain why mature economies, as a whole, accept, ex ante, significant current account deficits whereas emerging economies, as a whole, envisage current account surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Let me add that what holds true for the industrialised countries, as a whole, is not the case in the euro area, which is posting, by and large, a balanced current account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">Implications for the euro area And now to my last point: what are the specific implications of the growing role of emerging markets for the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The answer is clear, this is good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For instance, strong growth in emerging markets increases the demand for those goods and tradable services where the euro area has comparative advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Emerging market competition also strengthens the incentives to reform our economies and make further progress in terms of structural reforms, which are, in any case, needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The euro area has the potential to take advantage of the new opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In trade terms, the euro area is actually more open than other major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Our exports and imports of goods and services account for around one fifth of GDP, more than in the United States or in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The euro area is open to the emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Our trade relations with emerging Asia, Russia as well as with central and eastern European economies have strengthened noticeably over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Taken together, the share of emerging markets in euro area trade has grown from about one third, when the euro was introduced in 1999, to more than 40% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Trade relations with Turkey have also strengthened over time, to surpass 2% of euro area trade in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Perhaps less well known is the fact that the euro area is also very open financially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Consider the international balance sheet of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Its assets and liabilities vis-à-vis non-residents account for over 120% and 130% of euro area GDP, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This is more than in other large, mature economies, such as the United States, where the corresponding figures are 90% and 110% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Not only that: we are becoming increasingly open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Since the euro was created, in 1999, the size of euro area’s external assets and liabilities has grown by around 40 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">And again, if I focus on emerging markets only, perhaps one of the most interesting developments in recent years is that the euro area has become an attractive destination for foreign direct investment from the largest of these economies, although starting from very low levels, of course.</span><span style="background-color:
