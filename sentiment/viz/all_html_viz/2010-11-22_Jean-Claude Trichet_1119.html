    <span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)"> Hearing before the plenary of the European Parliament on the occasion of the adoption of the EP resolution on the ECB’s 2009 Annual Report Introductory statement by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBStrasbourg, 22 November 2010 Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les Membres du Parlement Européen, J’ai l’honneur de vous présenter – comme le prévoit le Traité – le Rapport annuel 2009 de la BCE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Du fait du calendrier légèrement bouleversé par les dernières élections européennes, c’est en mars dernier que j’étais intervenu devant vous pour vous présenter le Rapport annuel 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">C’est donc la deuxième fois cette année que j’interviens devant le Parlement au sujet du Rapport annuel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Permettez moi tout d’abord de me féliciter du soutien, exprimé une fois encore par la proposition de résolution du Parlement européen, en faveur des auditions régulières devant la Commission ECON et plus généralement en faveur du maintien de relations étroites avec la BCE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Je m’en réjouis d’autant plus que cette année, le Parlement européen a démontré avec force sa volonté et sa capacité à faire prévaloir l’intérêt supérieur européen, notamment sur le paquet de supervision financière.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Ich werde Ihnen zunächst einen kurzen Überblick über die geldpolitischen Maßnahmen der EZB während der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise geben.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Über die Krisenzeit hinaus möchte ich auch auf die Leistung der EZB während der ersten 12 Jahre zurückblicken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Schließlich möchte ich auf die dringendsten Herausforderungen, die uns im Jahre 2011 erwarten, eingehen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.97,0)">Actions taken by the ECB during the crisis 2009 was a most challenging year for the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.89,0)">It started with a severe economic downturn worldwide, following the outbreak of the financial crisis in autumn 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In this environment of subdued inflationary pressures, we continued with our policy of lowering our key rates further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.24,0)">Overall, within a period of only seven months   we lowered our main refinancing rate by 325 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This brought our main refinancing rate to 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">To ensure that households and firms in the euro area would benefit from these most favourable financing conditions, we also continued in 2009 with and even extended our enhanced credit support to euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.19,0)">We did this in response to dysfunctional money markets that had weakened the ability of monetary policy to influence the outlook for price stability by interest rate decisions alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Among those non-standard measures, as we use to call them, the most prominent one is the full allotment liquidity provision through our refinancing operations with euro area banks – against good collateral and at the main refinancing rate prevailing at the time for several maturities extending well beyond that of the weekly operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In 2009 we also extended the maturity of our longer-term refinancing operations to up to one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As rightly emphasised in your draft Resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report, this “enhanced credit support” has been successful in avoiding additional dysfunctional financial tensions which would have led to a depression or an even deeper recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Let me emphasise that all our action was fully in line with our mandate to deliver price stability in the medium-term for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">That we have been able to credibly deliver on our mandate is reflected in a favourable inflation outlook and well anchored inflation expectations in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.27,0)">Following some improvements in financial market conditions in the course of 2009, renewed market tensions erupted in a number of segments of the euro area bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Since the smooth functioning of the bond market is essential to the transmission of the ECB’s key interest rates, we decided to intervene in the euro area’s debt securities markets with the aim to help restoring a more normal transmission of monetary policy to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">To this end we introduced our Securities Markets Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">To ensure that the programme does not impact on our monetary policy stance, we re-absorb all the liquidity injected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">To sum up, let me emphasise that all our non-standard measures we have adopted during the period of acute financial stress are temporary in nature and were designed with exit considerations in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.04,0)">Some of the non-standard measures initiated in 2009 and early 2010 already have been phased out in view of improvements in conditions in some financial markets and taking the ongoing recovery of the euro area economy into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Achievements over the past 12 years Before considering the challenges ahead, let me share with you for a moment a few thoughts on the track record of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Three elements are fundamental.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">First, the ECB has delivered what it is expected to deliver according to its Treaty mandate that is price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed, euro area average inflation over the past now almost 12 years stands at 1.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This fully reflects our definition of price stability, namely our aim to keep annual inflation rates in the euro area below 2%, close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In this sense, the Eurosystem over the past 12 years has operated as an anchor of stability and confidence, including in the more recent times despite the challenging environment created by the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Second, and favourably reflecting on the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy, inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Third, this success is firmly grounded in the full independence of the ECB from political influence, in its primary mandate to maintain price stability and in its transparent communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy allows for a forward-looking and medium-term oriented course of action that is underpinned by a solid analytical framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Such framework must include a thorough analysis of monetary and credit developments, taking the monetary nature of inflation over the medium to longer term into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Such a comprehensive approach allows for well-informed and consistent decision-making, while being steady and looking through the short-term volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And fourth, as regards the external dimension of the euro, our currency has established itself internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In 2009, the euro represented around 30% in the stock of international debt securities, and in the stock of global foreign exchange reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Speaking of the external dimension of the euro, let me say a word on the present foreign exchange rate issues, domains where I would call for great prudence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are two major topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On the one hand, there is the relationship between the major floating convertible currencies of the industrialised countries, such as the dollar, the euro and the yen, the pound sterling, the Canadian dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.95,0)">These currencies have been floating since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system at the beginning of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.41,0)">I should underline the strong view of the International Community that excess volatility and disorderly movements in the exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">And I appreciate the recent statements by the US authorities - namely the US Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve – reiterating that a strong dollar vis-à-vis other major convertible currencies is in the interest of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I share this view entirely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">A dollar that is credible among the major currencies of the advanced economies is in the interest of the United States, of Europe and of the entire international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.64,0)">On the other hand, the second topic concerns the currencies of emerging market economies which have current account surpluses and exchange rates that are not sufficiently flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">On this issue, the international community agrees – and it was restated in Korea last week – that moving towards more market-determined exchange rate systems, enhancing exchange rate stability to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, and refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies, are in the interest of the emerging economies concerned and of the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.23,0)">Challenges ahead This is no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.64,0)">The challenges lying ahead of us are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All relevant authorities as well as the private sector must assume fully their responsibilities; governments and parliaments, central banks, regulators and supervisors, private sector and financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In particular, the current crisis has clearly demonstrated that implementing ambitious reforms in economic governance is in the interest both of the euro area countries and the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy on the reform of the EU’s economic governance and approved by the European Council meeting of 28-29 October 2010 represent an improvement to the current surveillance framework at EU level, and seem broadly appropriate for the EU countries not participating in Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.96,0)">However, as regards the specific requirements of the euro area, they fall short of what the ECB views as necessary to ensure the best possible functioning of the single currency economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">I am convinced that, over the coming months, the European Parliament will help Europe making the necessary quantum leap in economic governance a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">With its legislative role concerning financial supervision and the ESRB, the Parliament showed its determination when it comes to major issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for this, and to express again my conviction that the influence of the Parliament will be decisive in the economic governance debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Another important challenge ahead relates to financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">We should fully draw the lessons of the crisis and keep the momentum for financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">As advocated in your draft Resolution, a consistent and speedy implementation of Basel III is of crucial importance in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The Commission’s legislative proposals on short-selling and Over-The-Counter derivatives are also indispensable to make the financial system more transparent and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable representatives of the European citizens: We are facing a decisive year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">2011 should see the adoption of the revised governance framework, in-depth discussions on the crisis management framework and possibly the launch of the procedure for a Treaty change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">We need to get all these reforms right, so as to ensure that the euro area can meet the future challenges with even greater capacity and conviction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">2011 will be also the first year of existence of the European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">As you call for in your draft Resolution, the ECB is doing its utmost to support this new body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the same time, the full independence and the primary mandate of the ECB, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, are of course unchanged as I have already stressed before the Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">As it has done over the past 12 years, the ECB will continue to deliver on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is what the Treaty calls upon us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And this is what our fellow citizens expect from us.</span>
