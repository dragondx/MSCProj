    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> Monetary policy during the financial turmoil: what have we learned?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBdelivered at “The ECB and its Watchers X”Frankfurt am Main, 5 September 2008 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Let me begin my remarks this morning by recognising the contribution made by this conference over the past ten years to the ECB’s communication with market participants, journalists and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">While the issues have evolved over time, these conferences have invariably served to improve the transparency and understanding of the monetary policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I trust that this tradition will be continued today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.55,0)">The past thirteen months have been the most challenging of the ECB’s ten-year history, both for the ECB itself and for other central banks across the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.28,0)">We have experienced significant, multiple and coincident shocks, notably the emergence of financial tensions and sustained significant increases in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.83,0)">The latter has led to worryingly high rates of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.44,0)">These shocks have created an extremely complex and challenging environment for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.08,0)">Many observers and commentators have characterised us and our monetary policy as facing a dilemma – or even a trilemma – as we simultaneously confront inflation rates rising to levels not consistent with price stability a slowdown of economic activity and threats to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">How have we addressed these challenges at the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.36,0)">Have we ever been in a dilemma – or trilemma – situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">I will demonstrate how certain longstanding principles of sound central banking – which were embedded in our monetary policy framework from the outset – have guided our deliberations and actions through the recent turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">On the basis of our experience during this challenging period, I will then distil a few key lessons for central banks, in particular regarding the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The principles of sound monetary policy making The cumulated experiences of central banks over a long period of time, together with developments in modern economic theory, have forged a set of widely-accepted general principles for the conduct of sound monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As a starting point, allow me to list the most important ones: First, monetary policy must be given a clear and unambiguous mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Ever since the classic contributions of Tinbergen and Theil,   it has been recognised that a central bank endowed with one policy instrument can only pursue one goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.29,0)">Given the “long-run neutrality” of money and monetary policy – surely one of the most widely-accepted principles in modern macroeconomic thinking – the only feasible objective for monetary policy is to control the price level, since ultimately it is impotent with respect to the level of real income or employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Second, the central bank must be credible in its commitment to deliver this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Private longer-term inflation expectations must be securely anchored at levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To achieve this, the central bank must always be ready – and be seen to be ready – to take whatever action is necessary to deliver price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Making this commitment credible requires, in turn, that the central bank operates under the appropriate institutional set-up and that it develops, over time, a track record demonstrating its willingness and capacity to act so as to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Third, the central bank must be independent of political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">A large body of theoretical and empirical literature has established that central bank independence is conducive to maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.87,0)">Given the many short-term pressures they face to deviate from the objective of price stability, the involvement of politicians in monetary policy only serves to undermine its credibility and thereby its effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Fourth, so as to maintain its legitimacy, an institution endowed with independence to pursue a specific public objective must act in a transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Transparency and accountability also buttress the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to price stability, by ensuring that the public understand that the motivation behind monetary policy decisions is the achievement of the primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Fifth, monetary policy must maintain a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.86,0)">The long and variable lags that characterise the monetary policy transmission process make it impossible for monetary policy to offset the inevitable unanticipated shocks that buffet the economy and the price level in the short-run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.22,0)">Attempts to “fine tune” inflation developments on a month-to-month basis are doomed to fail and would only introduce additional unnecessary volatility into the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Sixth, monetary policy must be underpinned by a comprehensive analytical framework, which ensures that all information needed to take monetary policy decisions is available to policy makers in a form that supports efficient and timely decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Given the importance to maintaining credibility and a medium-term orientation, such a framework must include a thorough analysis of monetary and credit developments, reflecting the necessarily monetary nature of inflation over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Finally , a clear distinction must be maintained between: on the one hand, the determination of the monetary policy stance required to maintain price stability; and, on the other hand, the provision of liquidity to the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This so-called “ separation principle” ensures that the specification and conduct of refinancing operations are not interpreted by market participants as signals of future changes in the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the same time, it maintains the focus of the monetary policy decisions firmly on the delivery of the primary objective, thereby avoiding dilution or complication stemming from competing considerations regarding the functioning of the short-term money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The monetary policy of the ECB is firmly grounded in this set of interrelated and mutually reinforcing core principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some are embedded in the institutional framework of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In particular, the Maastricht Treaty assigns the ECB the primary objective to maintain price stability and endows us with the necessary independence to pursue this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Other principles have guided the design of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The strategy represents a framework for taking and communicating monetary policy decisions so as to deliver price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It embodies a quantitative definition of price stability, which promotes transparency about our objective and serves as an anchor for inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The strategy is clearly geared towards the medium term, as it emphasises that price stability will be maintained over this horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Moreover, the strategy represents a comprehensive framework for analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In particular, it encompasses two distinct, but complementary, perspectives for assessing the available data – an economic analysis and a monetary analysis – which help to organise, evaluate and cross-check the large set of information relevant for assessing risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The prominent role assigned to money in the strategy provides a nominal anchor which helps to cement the credibility of our commitment to price stability and to underpin the medium-term orientation of our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The key principles I have listed are also embodied in the Eurosystem’s operational framework for the implementation of the monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This framework strives to ensure that money market interest rates at the very short end of the yield curve remain in line with the level of interest rates decided by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A broad set of instruments and procedures are available to achieve this aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Crucially, at all times this function has been clearly distinguished from the determination of the monetary policy stance, thereby ensuring adherence to the separation principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This has supported the “neutrality” of liquidity operations with respect to monetary policy decisions: the specification and result of such operations are neither intended to offer, nor have been understood as offering, signals about future Governing Council decisions on key ECB interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Finally, an overarching characteristic of our monetary policy framework is the premium attached to transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This is illustrated in the clear formulation of our objective and the extensive documentation, for instance, of our strategy, our analytical framework and our assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Indeed this series of conferences is testament to the ECB’s commitment to the principle of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I regard this set of principles as indispensable elements of best practice in central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this respect, they play a very important role in monetary policymaking, regardless of the prevailing economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The significant success of the ECB and the single monetary policy over the past ten years is grounded in adherence to the principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Yet the experience of the past year has shown that adhering to these principles is particularly important in more challenging times, such as those characterised by the ongoing financial market tensions and recent commodity price surges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">In the remainder of my remarks, I would like to focus more specifically on a few of these principles that have proven to be particularly relevant in guiding our policy in this environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Monetary policy during the financial market tensions From the end of 2005, the Governing Council had gradually been raising key ECB interest rates in order to address the upside risks to price stability over the medium term implied by vigorous growth of broad money and credit aggregates and increasing resource constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This process was ongoing in the summer of 2007, and, following the Governing Council’s decision to hike rates in June, market participants expected further increases in key ECB rates in the second half of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.83,0)">It was in this context that significant financial tensions, initially in the money market, emerged in early August.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.22,0)">a) The monetary policy stance With the onset of these financial tensions, the Governing Council’s assessment of the prospects for the euro area economy and the outlook for price developments became subject to heightened uncertainty, as the uncertainties surrounding the transmission of monetary policy increased with the emergence of turbulence in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.59,0)">Moreover, it was unclear what implications the – possibly temporarily – high market interest rates   would have for spending and pricing decisions and the availability of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.09,0)">Characterising the monetary policy stance in this context was particularly complex, and caution was needed when assessing the potential impact of financial tensions on the real economy and the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">In this challenging environment, having a single, clear and unambiguous objective helped to focus attention on the fulfilment of our mandate, at a time when many siren voices were calling for actions in other directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In turn, this clear focus supported our credibility with the markets and public, while the quantitative definition of price stability provided an anchor for inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Moreover, our monetary policy strategy ensured that the appropriate medium-term orientation of monetary policy was maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.79,0)">Maintaining such a medium-term perspective ensured that we were not unduly influenced by market developments, which – particularly in a context of heightened tensions – can be rather excessive and perhaps near-sighted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">These characteristics of the monetary policy strategy imparted a “steady-handedness” to our policy decisions, even in the face of the challenges posed by financial market tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.8,0)">As a result, we have avoided a “go-stop” type of policy, which is well known to have plagued economies in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Rather than becoming an additional source of uncertainty and volatility in a challenging period, our steady-handed approach has led monetary policy to be a crucial element of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Importantly, this steady-handedness has bolstered the credibility of our commitment to deliver our objective of price stability and has therefore contributed to ensuring that inflation expectations in the euro area remain firmly anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">b) The role of monetary analysis The prominent role our strategy assigns to money was instrumental in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Paying due attention to trend developments in money has helped us to look through the transient impact of the many temporary shocks that buffet the economy, to act in a consistent manner over time and to maintain our focus on the medium-term horizon, when the effect of monetary policy on its primary objective – price stability – will materialise in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In addition, the monetary analysis has ensured that due consideration is given in policy discussions to underlying developments in the level of key nominal variables, thereby supporting the focus of policy discussions on our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As financial tensions emerged, the policy-relevant signal extracted from the broad based monetary analysis conducted at the ECB confirmed that liquidity in the euro area was ample and continued to increase at buoyant rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The monetary analysis therefore clearly signalled that medium-term risks to price stability continued to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This insight was crucial to the formulation of our policy response to the financial market tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.79,0)">Given that the risks identified have materialised as inflation has trended upwards over recent months, this signal does not seem to have been inappropriate, when assessed now with the benefit of hindsight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The identification of the policy-relevant signal in money contained in its lower-frequency developments involves “filtering” the monetary data in order to quantify and remove short-term “noise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The filtering process entails an encompassing and detailed examination of bank balance sheet data, including the components, counterparts and sectoral contributions to the monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is complemented by an analysis of the balance sheets of households, non-financial corporations and other financial intermediaries, as well as a comprehensive overview of the relevant financial and economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In practice, all these assessments are supported by a range of models, statistical tools and expert judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.1,0)">In an environment characterised by the smooth functioning of financial markets, such analysis merely serves to identify those short-term distortions of the monetary data that are not related to medium-term inflation dynamics; the “noise” identified as a by-product of the process is of little interest in its own right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">However, in the context of financial tensions, those elements that have typically been regarded as short-term noise have been found to offer important insights into the behaviour of the banking sector and, more broadly, how tensions in the money market and shocks to bank capital have influenced the financial system and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In particular, such insights have helped to inform our assessment of the conditions facing the financial sector and, importantly, the availability of financing to the non-financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.81,0)">As an example of this type of analysis, consider the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.71,0)">Last autumn, it was argued by many commentators that the continued buoyancy of lending to the non-financial private sector in the euro area was misleading, because it represented “ re-intermediation” effects triggered by the tensions themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.4,0)">In other words, it was suggested that the loan data were distorted by the inability of banks to shift loans off their balance sheets, given the effective closure of the securitisation market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.51,0)">As a result, these loans had to be retained on banks’ balance sheets and therefore boosted the lending figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.09,0)">Careful analysis revealed, however, that owing to the accounting framework underlying the statistical reporting in some euro area countries, the scope for such re-intermediation in the euro area was very limited and, in any case, could not account for the robust growth of lending to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.46,0)">A further hypothesis advocated by some commentators since the onset of the financial tensions, was that the ongoing strength in MFI lending to non-financial corporations mainly reflected the drawdown of pre-committed credit facilities, at terms agreed before the tensions erupted and did not represent new credit decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The analysis of the data on overdrafts, where drawdowns under existing contracts are reported in most euro area countries, suggested that the outstanding amount of overdrafts had been increasing continuously, well before the financial tensions emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">While the average monthly flow of overdrafts to non-financial corporations rose somewhat after August 2007, this increase can only account for a very small part of the average monthly flow of MFI lending to this sector during this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.67,0)">Another argument put forward was that due to the alleged reduction in the availability of financing to non-financial corporations from market-based sources, additional bank borrowing may have been used to compensate for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.96,0)">As a result, according to this argument, the data on MFI lending to firms was being upwardly affected by a substitution effect, while the total new financing available to them had in fact stalled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.5,0)">An encompassing analysis of the financing of non-financial corporations based on data on MFI loans, the net issuance of securities other than shares and the issuance of equity – which are available in a timely manner – refuted this argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.22,0)">More specifically, the data at the euro area level pointed to some limited moderation in the flow of financing to non-financial corporations stemming from developments in the issuance of debt securities and equity, which did not, however, provide scope for material substitution effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In addition, the analysis of money and credit developments was able to provide us with insights that were helpful in calibrating our liquidity policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">For instance, a detailed, security-by-security analysis of Asset Backed Commercial Paper   issuance, enabled us to monitor the refinancing patterns of these programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Combining this with information on credit institutions’ commitments to ABCP issuers, we were able to arrive at a quantitative assessment of the tensions in the money market that the breakdown of activity in the ABCP market was generating, in the run-up to the year end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Finally, in the context of identifying the sources and causes of tensions in the money market, the role of money market funds – which are a crucial provider of funding to the banking system – was examined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.82,0)">The analysis of developments in the portfolio allocation of money market funds helped to shed light on the question of whether their behaviour had exacerbated the liquidity shock suffered by credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.17,0)">In particular, the analysis showed that while money market funds continued to supply funding to the banking system at robust aggregate levels, changes in their portfolio composition – including a reduction in the maturity profile – are likely to have increased the uncertainty for banks regarding their sources of funding, thereby contributing, at the margin, to the ongoing tensions in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Such analysis not only supported the assessment of the underlying monetary trends, but also informed the shorter-term evaluation of the impact of tensions on the financial sector, on financing conditions and credit availability and, ultimately, on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In addition, the insights attained through the broad monetary analysis have contributed to generating plausible scenarios regarding the possible impact of the financial market tensions on the real economy, which have also informed the monetary policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Overall, the conclusion emerged that the availability of funding to the euro area non-financial sector had not been significantly impaired as a result of the financial market tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">While we continue to monitor developments closely, this assessment was a valuable input into the policy discussion, in a context where the existence of a “credit crunch” was widely perceived to be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This is not to deny, of course, that the growth in loans to the non-financial private sector has moderated recently, and indeed is expected to continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.44,0)">However, this largely reflects the regular impact of developments in economic activity and tighter credit conditions, with no signs so far of an additional effect coming from the financial tensions affecting, for example, the capital position of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">c) Money market operations and liquidity management While the ECB has maintained a steady hand in its monetary policy decisions, we have not been passive in the face of financial tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Rather – and contrary to the expectations of some observers – we have proved able to act rapidly and, when necessary, significantly, to support the functioning of the money market that is central to the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">During this period of heightened stress and uncertainty, the ECB has used its liquidity operations in a pragmatic manner, consistent with both the monetary policy stance decided by the Governing Council and the market-oriented approach that has always characterised our liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Although the frequency of liquidity operations has increased when necessary and the timing and maturity of liquidity provision has evolved over time, such actions aimed at reassuring market participants about the continuation of transactions in the money market and have neither involved substantial changes to the operational framework nor impinged on the monetary policy decisions and the primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This approach is the direct application of the separation principle, making a distinction between the determination of the monetary policy stance and its implementation through liquidity operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It has also contributed towards maintaining transparency, by avoiding that monetary policy decisions and liquidity operations become entwined and thus confused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">At the same time, it is clear that the separation principle does not preclude that the decisions on the appropriate monetary policy stance be underpinned by, among other considerations, an assessment of the extent to which the tensions in the financial markets may impact on the real economy and the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Looking in more detail at the operations deployed since the outset of the financial market tensions, three measures are important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, relative to normal times, the Eurosystem has adjusted the distribution of liquidity supplied over the course of the reserve maintenance period, while the total amount of liquidity over an entire reserve maintenance period has remained essentially unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">So-called “frontloading” of the provision of liquidity has supplied more liquidity at the beginning of the maintenance period, while reducing it later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Second, the Eurosystem has lengthened the average maturity of its outstanding refinancing by undertaking additional longer-term operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Third, fine-tuning operations have been used more frequently – albeit still to a very modest extent – especially in the first few months of the period of tension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Despite higher than usual volatility, as a result of these actions the average level of the EONIA has remained close to the minimum bid rate, as intended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The stance of monetary policy reflected in the Governing Council’s monthly decisions has therefore been effectively achieved and signalled, maintaining the separation principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The basic structure of the operational framework, including the broad ranges of counterparties and collateral eligible for use in Eurosystem operations, has been in place since the beginning of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">All the current features have been in place since well before the emergence of financial tensions a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In contrast to the experience in other countries, no fundamental changes were required to the design of the Eurosystem’s operational framework in order to address the dislocation in the money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Acceptance of a wide range of collateral has helped the banking system to manage its liquidity situation in the period of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In the case of the Eurosystem’s operational framework, the eligibility of bank loans and asset-backed securities for the refinancing operations of the Eurosystem has helped banks’ refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, the ECB only accepts collateral of good credit standing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">d) International cooperation In parallel, central banks have also strengthened their cooperation, first through enhanced information exchange and collective monitoring of market developments, and later on by coordinated steps to provide liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Since December 2007, the ECB has, in cooperation with other major central banks, conducted several term auction facilities – so-called TAF operations – in which it provides US dollar liquidity to euro area banks on behalf of the Federal Reserve System.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">These liquidity-providing operations do not have a direct effect on euro liquidity conditions, but are rather conducted to address the concerns of euro area banks regarding the limited availability of funding denominated in US dollars and are aimed at improving global funding conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Lessons for monetary policy My remarks thus far have illustrated how our monetary policy framework has enabled us to address the challenges that emerged in the past thirteen months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is clear, however, that we should refrain from being complacent given that important challenges remain ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.07,0)">Inflation remains at worrying levels and financial tensions persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">If anything, the challenges for monetary policy are intensifying rather than waning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">In such an environment, it is all the more important to draw on our experience to derive lessons that can help to address the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">A number of such lessons stand out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, we must follow and be guided by certain longstanding principles of sound central banking, particularly in the field of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is true at all times, but particularly so during times of turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">At the same time, a degree of pragmatism is always required to calibrate the appropriate response to the inevitably idiosyncratic nature of any individual episode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But such pragmatism must respect the core principles I have elaborated on today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second , monetary policy is best placed to discharge its duty if it draws on a comprehensive analytical framework to identify risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In particular, one of the main lessons of our recent experience has been to confirm and underline the importance of the analysis of developments in money and credit when formulating monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In particular, a thorough and broad based monetary analysis   is crucial in identifying medium-term risks to price stability;   has enhanced our understanding of market developments; and   can support the early detection of financial imbalances and asset price misalignments, which appear to be among the roots of the current tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">To be more precise, the close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets implies that a thorough monetary analysis can help central banks to detect such imbalances at an early stage and thereby to respond to the implied risks to price and financial stability in a timely and forward-looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This has proved to be an invaluable asset for the ECB, notably in times of global financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Indeed, had it not been for the timely policy action of the ECB in late 2005 – when key rates were raised largely on the basis of the insights offered by the monetary analysis – the build-up of inflationary pressures, financial imbalances and asset price misalignments that have subsequent become apparent would have been even greater.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Third, as regards the implementation of monetary policy, the main lesson to be drawn from this episode is the need to be flexible and pragmatic in liquidity operations, while always ensuring that they remain separate from and subservient to the decision regarding the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In other words, the separation principle must be adhered to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Experience has shown that such a broad and flexible operational framework is able to cope with dislocations in the market without the need to resort to fundamental adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.1,0)">At the same time, it should be recalled that the ECB, as indeed any central bank, cannot ensure that the money market is always shielded from all volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The smooth functioning of the market depends largely on the behaviour of the market participants, reflecting underlying trust, confidence and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The central bank is responsible for managing the provision of liquidity in a way that promotes a market-oriented approach and avoids rendering market participants dependent on its operations for their very short-term liquidity needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.04,0)">From this perspective, it is important not to create incentives that would discourage market participants from making their contribution to the normal functioning of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.57,0)">Above all, it is not the role of the central bank to replace the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Our aim is to create an environment that supports the efficient and smooth functioning of a market among private sector participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">As long as tensions in the money market persist, we will continue to undertake the liquidity operations required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Market participants should not, however, become reliant upon the ECB to meet their funding needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Indeed, we encourage market participants to step up to their role as market makers, in order to help in restoring normality in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Fourth, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the economy is to deliver price stability, which should, therefore, be its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">By delivering price stability, monetary policy also contributes, in the most efficient manner, to economic conditions that foster growth, employment and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, it is not within the power of monetary policy to ensure the attainment of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">Responsibility for this lies primarily with market participants themselves, as well as with regulators and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this respect, a central bank only contributes to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Fifth, and related to this, safeguarding the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to deliver price stability is of the essence, particularly in a context where shocks, such as the increase in commodity prices, threaten to unhinge inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.92,0)">In the present company I do not need to go into the details of the repercussions that the vicious circle that would result from such an un-anchoring of inflation expectations would have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.12,0)">What I would like to stress, however, is that a move to adjust the quantitative definition of price stability, in the current environment, would seriously damage the credibility of the central bank and should, therefore, be dismissed out of hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This brings me to my sixth and final point: in a world where financial institutions operate in many jurisdictions and in many currencies there are obvious benefits in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness if central banks cooperate when conducting their money market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As previously mentioned, in the face of the tensions in the money markets, the major central banks have stepped-up their cooperation, with rather impressive results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Clearly there are further benefits to be reaped from enhancing this cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Concluding remarks In the current challenging environment, maintaining price stability is both more demanding and more important than usual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Siren voices from various quarters ask that we subordinate this duty to other considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.42,0)">Such voices are becoming ever more voluble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In this context, the principles embedded in our monetary policy framework have been, I think, instrumental in ensuring that we stay the course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As an activity intrinsically related to the anchoring of longer-term expectations, monetary policy making must be governed by principles and implemented by practices that have withstood the test of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">My experience as a central banker in a period of significant financial tension has reinforced, more than ever, my conviction that adhering to the sound core principles on which I have elaborated is of the essence.</span>
