    <h1> Asset purchases, financial regulation and repo market activity </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ERCC General Meeting on “The repo market: market conditions and operational challenges”, Brussels, 14 November 2017 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)"> Asset purchases, financial regulation and repo market activity Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ERCC General Meeting on “The repo market: market conditions and operational challenges”, Brussels, 14 November 2017 Let me thank the organisers for inviting me here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The repo market is a cornerstone in the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In its traditional role, it is a prime short-term funding market for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.97,0)">Before the outbreak of the global financial crisis, secured transactions accounted for around a third of the daily turnover in euro area money markets according to money market statistical reporting   data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Today, their share is closer to two-thirds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.21,0)">Movements in short-term repo rates therefore change the market-based financing conditions for banks and, hence, their conditions for trading with their ultimate customers – firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This means that repo rates are a prime channel through which changes in the monetary policy stance are transmitted to the broader financial market and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In addition, the repo market plays an important intermediation role in the financial system by being the main vehicle for sourcing and financing government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In this role, the repo market critically supports the liquidity of the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It offers investors the possibility to finance long positions and to borrow securities to deliver into short positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.48,0)">Interruptions in the repo market may therefore affect the entire term structure of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The implication is that central banks need to have a watchful eye on developments in the repo market to ensure that it transmits and reflects the intended monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.67,0)">This includes monitoring the impact of their own actions on repo market activity, as well as the effects of other, external factors that could potentially drive a wedge between central banks’ own intentions and actual financial market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In fact, two watchful eyes are not too many, in view of the risks that this market may pose to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.3,0)">Because repo trades are predominately of a very short-term nature, and secured funding can create a false sense of security when collateral prices are in fact often procyclical , excessive reliance on repo market funding may quickly turn into a source of instability for the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">The scars from the great financial crisis are still visible today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In my remarks today I would like to discuss two factors that have recently been highlighted by market observers, practitioners and academics alike as potentially challenging the intermediation capacity of repo markets, namely central bank asset purchases and post-crisis prudential regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">I will show that the ECB’s asset purchase programme   left a visible footprint in the repo market, but that last year’s modifications to our securities lending facility contributed to restoring an appropriate balance between ensuring the effectiveness of our measures and the smooth functioning of repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.85,0)">I will also provide empirical evidence that challenges the view that financial regulation has adversely impacted repo market activity so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But I will also argue that further evidence is needed to draw conclusions on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.57,0)">Asset purchases and repo market activity Let me start with the impact of central bank asset purchases on recent repo market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.92,0)">Asset purchases may have two broad effects on repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.21,0)">The first is their impact on excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">With central banks exchanging large amounts of reserves for longer-dated securities, banks may no longer need to tap the interbank market, both secured and unsecured, to manage their short-term liquidity needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.8,0)">As a result, trading volumes may fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The second effect is closer to one of the main transmission channels of asset purchase programmes, namely portfolio rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.26,0)">In imperfect financial markets, those in need of scarce securities, or those who have a special preference for them, need to bid harder to obtain them, thereby pushing up their price and lowering their yield – which then delivers financial conditions supportive of higher output and prices in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">There is growing empirical evidence that this channel has been very effective in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.95,0)">The flip side to this is that, although purchases are conducted in the secondary cash market, price adjustments in this market can also be expected to affect conditions in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">A simple way to think about this is through short-selling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.84,0)">Bonds being richer in the cash market will make it more difficult to borrow them via reverse repos.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This should also push up the price in the repo market, all else equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In addition, investors who own more expensive securities should be able to profit from them by obtaining lower funding costs in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">In other words, because the cash and the repo market often intermediate the same asset, it is natural that changes in one market may have repercussions in the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.25,0)">Both effects have clearly left a footprint in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But one needs to look beyond aggregate data to understand the full impact of the ECB’s APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.28,0)">For example, there has been no overall fall in average euro repo market turnover since the great financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Daily volumes in the repo market even rose in recent years, despite the considerable increase in excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">You can see this clearly on my first slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">According to MMSR data, turnover was close to €350 billion daily in the second quarter of this year, up from around €250 billion a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What has changed, however, is the type of transaction executed in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">This you can see clearly on this slide and on the next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">First, there has been a clear shift from unsecured to secured transactions since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.07,0)">Second, as can be seen on the next slide, increasing excess liquidity has led to a notable decline in the share of trades backed by general collateral  , which is traditionally used to obtain funding for cash management purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This may suggest that proceeds from the sales of securities, together with the ECB conducting its main refinancing operations at fixed rate full allotment, have increasingly acted as a substitute for funding in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">At the same time, we have observed an appreciable increase in collateral-driven or specific repos.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">You can see this on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In other words, repos are increasingly conducted as a means to move securities among market participants, not primarily to raise cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There might be several reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.79,0)">Smaller inventories held by market-makers after the crisis, for example, may cause them to source bonds in the repo market more often.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.17,0)">Alternatively, short-selling activity may have increased, a phenomenon often observed at, or close to, monetary policy turning points when investors expect yields to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.23,0)">One factor that is likely to have contributed to the rise in special repos is policy-induced scarcity, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This can best be seen when considering the German Bund market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.94,0)">Here, our purchases have absorbed a multiple of net issuance in recent years, meaning that we have actively reduced the stock of outstanding bonds held by private market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.07,0)">The consequence is that investors in search of these securities increasingly need to pay a premium, a specialness premium, which, broadly speaking, reflects the costs of the difficulty in finding a lender of the security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.21,0)">The premium will then depend on the scarcity of the underlying asset and their holding structure: many of the residual government bond holders are unwilling to sell them, or will sell them at a higher price due to regulation or their own asset-liability management rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Our asset purchases have coincided with a notable increase in the share of German bonds that trade “special” in the repo market, meaning they trade at a premium over GC rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">Before we started our purchases, typically less than 5% of bonds in the German repo market were trading special.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In the second half of last year, this share increased to more than 50%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Year-end events, which I will come back to later, pushed their share even higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">You can also see that specialness did not increase immediately with the start of our purchases under the public sector purchase programme   in March 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.76,0)">The reason might be related to potential non-linearities in the way supply changes affect market outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.48,0)">That is, price effects from the flow of purchases may only become visible the moment supply effectively starts to constrain demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.91,0)">Reverse supply effects are also clearly visible on the same chart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">When the ECB Governing Council, in December last year, decided to also accept cash as collateral in our securities lending facility, we effectively increased the supply of bonds available in the repo market, thereby swiftly reducing the share of bonds trading special.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.21,0)">The price effects of this decision can be seen on the next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Before we accepted cash as collateral, there was a strong positive relationship between the level of excess liquidity and repo rates, not only for trades backed by German collateral, but also for those involving French and, to a lesser extent, Italian securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.73,0)">The moment we amended our securities lending facility in December last year, the relationship broke down, as you can see on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Recent ECB analysis confirms the intimate relationship between cash and repo markets and the impact of supply and demand effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The authors estimate that a 1% reduction in the effective supply may increase specialness, on average, by up to five basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Studies for the US market come to qualitatively similar conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.65,0)">In other words, whether a bond trades special, and by how much, depends crucially on its effective supply, which is itself affected by factors such as the amount of investors that are willing to lend out securities in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These effects are also found to be persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">You can see this on the same slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The “scarcity” premium stabilised in spite of continuously increasing excess liquidity, but did not regress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In other words, continued scarcity in the cash market implies that the remaining holders of bonds continue to benefit from lower financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.11,0)">You can also see this on the previous slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.86,0)">In 2017, looking through the occasional ups and downs, around 30% of the bonds continued to trade special.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The objective of our decision to also accept cash in securities lending was, therefore, not to prevent all instances of specialness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.96,0)">Put simply, this would have meant acting in the cash market or to sterilise bond purchases, which would run counter to our desired monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The present inflation outlook requires financing conditions to remain accommodative for a considerable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our objective was rather to support smooth repo market functioning, also with a view to avoiding episodes of extreme specialness, such as at the end of a year or quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.71,0)">Extreme specialness may result in serious market malfunctioning, with investors choosing to strategically fail to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.98,0)">It is therefore fair to say that the initial restriction – only lending bonds against other PSPP-eligible securities – was too penalising and is likely to have contributed to the growing specialness premium in the segment of the yield curve where the Eurosystem was intervening most heavily last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">You can see this on the next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.08,0)">Purchases under the PSPP in Germany have long been concentrated in medium to long-term maturities due to the restriction, at that time, not to conduct purchases below the deposit facility rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Increasing scarcity in that segment of the cash market then also translated into a persistent rise in the specialness premia of such bonds, even when abstracting from year-end effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Our decision to accept cash as collateral in securities lending, and to allow purchases below the DFR, contributed to relieving this pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Premia across maturity buckets are now broadly similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The relatively low specialness premia for bonds with shorter maturities, in turn, also suggests that the majority of holders of such bonds – mainly non-euro area investors without access to our deposit facility, as I illustrated in a previous speech – were, and remain, generally willing to provide them in sufficient quantity in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.85,0)">Yet, this chart also reinforces the point I made earlier about the flow and stock effects of our purchases: with the effective supply of bonds gradually shrinking over time as a result of our purchases, specialness premia have been persistently inching upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">While stock effects reinforce one of the key transmission channels of the APP by increasing the “value for money” – the bang for the buck – of new net purchases in terms of their impact on financial conditions, we also need to be mindful that a shortage of government bonds may over time adversely affect the intermediation capacity of repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are two reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, government bonds are the main type of collateral used in repo markets, primarily because of their safety and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">According to MMSR data, euro area government bonds represent more than 80% of the collateral used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.54,0)">Second, the supply of safe private collateral is necessarily scarce , while the supply of safe public collateral has fallen on account of both a decline in net issuance and the downgrades in sovereign credit ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.95,0)">For example, the share of euro area bonds rated AAA by at least two rating agencies has fallen from levels around 60% before the great financial crisis to around 20% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.23,0)">In other words, safe debt is in short supply and debt in long supply is less safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This is also why the Governing Council’s decision of 26 October, when it decided to extend the horizon of its asset purchases by another nine months, and to reduce the pace of monthly purchases to €30 billion, emphasised the contribution of the stock of acquired assets, together with forthcoming reinvestments, to providing continued monetary support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.29,0)">Financial regulation and repo market activity Asset purchases are not the only factor affecting supply and demand conditions in cash and repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">This brings me to the second part of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.4,0)">As you know, a number of liquidity regulations affecting banks, such as the net stable funding ratio   and the liquidity coverage ratio  , require banks to hold a sufficient quantity of high-quality liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.44,0)">At face value, these regulations could be expected to have contributed to bumping up demand for government bonds, thereby reinforcing the effects of the ECB’s APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">But because, as a result of our asset purchases, banks hold a large amount of central bank reserves, which count as high-quality liquid assets, such regulations are unlikely to have been a key driver of increasing collateral scarcity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.2,0)">These reforms, however, are likely to have affected the repo market in different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">One of them you can see on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Here I show the distribution of repo market activity for one-day tenor contracts exchanged bilaterally or via central clearing counterparties   for German collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The chart shows an interesting feature, namely that the market attaches a premium to centrally cleared transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The reasons for this are unlikely to surprise you: the leverage ratio allows for offsetting cash proceeds to be netted off when the transactions are with the same counterparty, have the same end date, and are conducted in the same settlement system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This means that although repo transaction are not part of the 2009 Pittsburgh central clearing mandate, which covers OTC derivatives, centrally cleared transactions have a premium because they make those trades less capital intensive compared with non-nettable ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.72,0)">According to MMSR data, around two-thirds of repo transactions are already cleared centrally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.92,0)">So, what we seem to have observed so far is that the leverage ratio – contrary to much-voiced concerns – has not led to a reduction in repo volumes, but rather to a change in the way trades are settled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">And to the extent that these trades are increasingly intermediated through CCPs, this is clearly a positive development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">CCPs reduce counterparty and systemic risks and help clearing members economise the use of scarce collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There is also empirical evidence that clearing increases market resilience in periods of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Resilience of trading volumes to regulatory reforms is also confirmed by empirical analysis conducted by ECB staff – the results of which will be published in the ECB’s financial stability review on 29 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will offer a short preview today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.19,0)">In this report, ECB staff assess the effects of recent regulatory reforms on repo market developments at quarter-end, based on supervisory data for a sample of more than 50 banks directly supervised by the euro area’s single supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Micro data are important to ensure that aggregate repo market developments do not mask a significant impact of regulatory reforms at the individual bank level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.67,0)">The findings suggest that, although banks’ adjustments to higher leverage ratios seem to be somewhat correlated with a reduction in their repo volumes, the effects are not found to be economically meaningful relative to other exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.25,0)">Other regulatory measures, such as the LCR or the NSFR, are found to have had no statistically significant impact so far on repo volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.73,0)">The study also highlights that the more significant falls in banks’ outstanding repo volumes at year-end are likely to have also been driven by additional factors, such as contributions to the single resolution fund or national bank levies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.64,0)">These findings are not the final word on the matter, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.74,0)">The repo market is in a state of transition as the report by a study group of the Committee on the Global Financial System  , chaired by Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe, recently concluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this respect, the CGFS also recommended in April that a further study on repo markets be undertaken within the next two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This means that policymakers will continue to closely monitor developments in repo markets and financial markets more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Some effects can only be thoroughly assessed once the reforms have been implemented more meaningfully, while others may become clearer at an earlier stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.07,0)">For example, it seems undisputable that regulatory reforms have contributed to temporary volatility in repo market activity on reporting dates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.81,0)">Specifically, window-dressing behaviour of banks appears a likely unintended effect of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">I would therefore encourage further analysis of methods that could help reduce volatility and thereby contribute to a smoother functioning of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In this respect, you will have seen in a recently published Opinion of the ECB on, inter alia, amendments to the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  , that the ECB supports the review of the calculation method for the leverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">I have also previously voiced support as CPMI Chair for implementing the leverage ratio in a way that does not create disincentives for centrally cleared transactions, namely by offsetting the initial margin in the case of derivative exposures related to client clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">All these exercises, however, should not be mistaken for tolerance of a relaxation of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Post-crisis reforms aim to curb excessive leverage and reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and for good reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is also why the Financial Stability Board   has published specific recommendations, including a framework for minimum haircuts for securities financing transactions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The FSB has also assessed the potential financial stability risks related to collateral re-use in SFTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The latter may contribute to a build-up of leverage and increase interconnectedness among market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The FSB concluded that regulatory reforms, in particular the leverage ratio and the liquidity requirements, are important to mitigate these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This means that the implementation of the Basel III reforms will have effects on repo markets, as intended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">These might look undesirable from an institution-perspective but they will have system-wide benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The repo market is undergoing significant change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.25,0)">Regulation is forcing market participants to re-examine the extent of their engagement and make more efficient use of their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.19,0)">This adjustment process coincides with central banks worldwide adopting a series of unconventional monetary policy measures that have also affected the nature and scope of repo market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.81,0)">Some of these effects will prove temporary, others more permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Their full impact can only be assessed in earnest once markets have fully transitioned to their new steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">From a central bank perspective, it is important to ensure that our own measures do not adversely affect the intermediation capacity of repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Our decision in December last year to also accept cash as collateral in our securities lending facility has proven very effective in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">It contributed to mitigating risks of extreme specialness, while preserving the effectiveness of our policy measures in the pursuit of our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At the same time, a high degree of persistence in repo specialness lends support to the idea that the stock of securities already held by the ECB is likely to be a powerful channel through which our measures can help preserve accommodative financing conditions, even after the end of our net asset purchases.</span>
