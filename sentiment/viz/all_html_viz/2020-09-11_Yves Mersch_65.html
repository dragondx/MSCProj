    <span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)"> Supervisory action in times of crisis and the limits of the ECB’s prudential mandate Introductory statement by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum in Berlin Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2020 Today, I will reflect on two issues: our role in the extraordinary measures taken to keep economies afloat since the outbreak of the current crisis, and the limits of the ECB’s prudential mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.65,0)">The pandemic has dealt an unprecedented peacetime blow to the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.0,0)">In spring, a great number of our businesses went into full lockdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Crucially, however, banks in the euro area were able to offer vital support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">To this end, ECB Banking Supervision provided far-reaching capital and operational relief, making record levels of lending possible during this exceptional time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">More precisely, in March we took an unconventional decision: we asked all euro area banks to restrict their dividend distributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In July, we extended this recommendation by another three months until the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.44,0)">This was not an easy move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Under normal conditions, profitable and healthy banks should not be prevented from remunerating their shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">Restricting dividends can increase banks’ funding costs, have an impact on their access to capital markets and make them less competitive than their international peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.02,0)">At the same time, I am aware that our recommendation may disproportionately penalise well-capitalised lenders and those set up as non-joint stock companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Nevertheless, I still consider such an exceptional and temporary “one-size-fits-all” approach to be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">Our vulnerability analysis only produced accurate estimates of capital depletion on a sector-wide rather than on an individual bank basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.73,0)">And, while prudent capital planning is the order of the day, the current economic uncertainty means that banks are simply unable to forecast their medium-term capital needs accurately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Such an unorthodox move was therefore justified by our ultimate goal to counteract procyclical developments and support banks’ capacity to absorb losses during the crisis without compromising their ability to continue lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Nevertheless, this recommendation is, and must remain, exceptional and temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.82,0)">We will review it in December, and unless we conclude that the banks’ capital projections remain clouded by high uncertainty, we will revert to our usual supervisory practice of assessing planned distributions of dividends on a bank-by-bank basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.65,0)">We opted to be prudent today to avoid having regrets tomorrow should overall economic conditions further deteriorate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The ECB is in good company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Other institutions have joined the effort to keep the financial taps open for the real economy during this exceptional period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">After the “quick fix” to the Capital Requirements Regulation, the European Commission recently adopted a Capital Markets Recovery Package to make it easier for capital markets to support the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The proposal to amend the Securitisation Regulation is part of this package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It includes a recital stating that the requirements on direct risk retention, transparency and the resecuritisation ban are also prudential obligations and thus specifically entrusted to the competent authorities in charge of prudential supervision, implying that the ECB has an active supervisory role in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.84,0)">This, in my view, is problematic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The ECB recognises its competence to supervise banks’ adherence to some securitisation obligations that are prudential in nature, such as the use of proper credit granting criteria for exposures to be securitised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, the other tasks include the supervision of compliance with direct risk retention requirements, transparency requirements and the ban on resecuritisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">These tasks fall under the category of product supervision rather than prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They ensure the alignment of interests between investors and originators, and between sponsors and original lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They allow investors to understand, assess and compare securitisation transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.45,0)">The ECB cannot take on these tasks because they go beyond its prudential supervision mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.02,0)">Article 127  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the SSM Regulation clearly define these limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">A simple recital cannot change these; only a Treaty change can.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.14,0)">Re-labelling financial product supervision tasks as prudential tasks won’t do the trick.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.08,0)">What’s more, assigning financial product supervision to the ECB could result in conflicting responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">In its role as prudential supervisor, the ECB generally wants as little risk as possible to remain with a bank acting as originator, so as to minimise arbitrage opportunities with the corresponding reduction of capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">At the same time, the competent authority needs to ensure that the bank retains a material net economic interest under the risk retention obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.45,0)">This might be linked to the need to preserve proper credit granting standards but might also create conflict in relation to the ECB’s objective as prudential supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To conclude, I do not see the proposed conferral of tasks as being either a viable allocation of labour or legally tenable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Extraordinary supervisory action is warranted in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.2,0)">But the ECB cannot take on tasks that go beyond its prudential supervision mandate.</span>
