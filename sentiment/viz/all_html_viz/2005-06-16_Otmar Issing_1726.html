    <span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)"> European integration – achievements and challenges Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the Workshop on “What effects is EMU having on the euro area and its member countries”, 16 June 2005 I wish to thank you all – as presenters, discussants, participants and organisers – for your valuable contributions to the analysis and discussion of a difficult topic: the effects that European Economic and Monetary Union   – and the euro in particular – is having on the euro area and its member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">For the ECB, understanding these effects is extremely important and over the past years, we have paid a lot of attention to this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In fact, this workshop follows on from a series of previous exercises we have undertaken over recent years, such as the Workshop on Monetary Policy Implications of Heterogeneity in a Currency Area of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You are all familiar with the terms of the debate – to what extent EMU is contributing to the functioning of the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In fact, experience is showing that many of the conditions for a well-functioning currency area have emerged as a result of the monetary integration process itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Tonight, however, I would like to set the workshop in a broader context and reflect on the relationship between political, economic and monetary integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.91,0)">This has been called the “triangle” between the state  , the market and the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.46,0)">I am aware that this is not an easy subject for a dinner speech, especially during these difficult times with the recent rejection of the Constitution in France and the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, it is in difficult times that we have to address the fundamentals and that is what I intend to do tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will start with a confession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.96,0)">I always felt uneasy talking about “European integration” when this project included only a small part of continental Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">At the beginning, there were six founding countries that established a customs union and a common market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Later, more and more countries joined in several waves of enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">At the same time, more elements and functions were shared at the level of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Hence, over time, joining the terms “European” and “integration” became more meaningful!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Economic integration took the lead In September 1946, Winston Churchill, in his memorable Zurich speech, called for the re-creation of the “European family”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This included the setting-up of a structure permitting Europe to live in peace, safety and freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Although political integration proved to be over-ambitious, some visionary political leaders decided, nevertheless, to pursue the path of economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This led to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and the establishment of the European Economic Community with the Treaty of Rome in 1957.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The first step was a customs union among the six founding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the time, probably nobody could have guessed that economic integration would advance through various phases and over such a long period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But the Single European Act followed in 1986 and the “Single Market Programme” in 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In short, the Single Market is now becoming a reality and we can say that the economic side of the “triangle” has indeed progressed enormously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Work on the remaining imperfections of the Single Market is also advancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We must not forget that this process has required many decades and continuous political support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Why, in the last 50 years, did economic integration face fewer obstacles and actually keep in motion the process of European integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The main reason is that, from the outset, economic integration removed barriers and thereby secured material and economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In fact, it has brought widespread benefits by promoting reciprocal trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">And as we heard from Richard Baldwin in Session I this afternoon, trade has grown by several multiples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Economic integration has also helped to establish a more competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.54,0)">We must also not forget that economic integration has rendered all EU countries more interdependent than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.93,0)">Under these circumstances, spillovers from national policies could be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Each country has a stake in the well-being and, let me say, “good behaviour” of its partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Given such circumstances, the conviction underlying the Maastricht Treaty was that nominal exchange rates should be irrevocably fixed to achieve and maintain a truly unified single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.01,0)">Without a single currency, it was felt that the achievements and deepening of the Single Market could be endangered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At the same time, the move to Monetary Union was not only “defensive” but also, at least implicitly, “expansionary”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monetary Union then followed Monetary Union in Europe was launched in January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The single currency eliminates, once and for all, internal nominal exchange rate fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It also secures and reinforces the continuation of economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The creation of a single currency for now more than 300 million people has increased the efficiency of currency use in a manner unprecedented in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Monetary Union also has a clear political dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It entails the transfer of national monetary policy decision-making powers to a supranational entity, the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Relinquishing national sovereignty in such an important field is a contribution to political integration – a central bank is, after all, an element of statehood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This step was only possible because EMU members had achieved a high degree of convergence in monetary policy attitudes and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Moreover, the launch of the euro marked a deep change in the way participating countries see themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Thus, the monetary side of the “triangle” has also been completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It was a political decision to launch European Economic and Monetary Union among a group of countries which did not form a fully-fledged political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Taking stock, we may ask: was this move appropriate and well founded from an economic standpoint?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the 1960s, a group of researchers – following the pioneering contributions of Mundell, Kenen and McKinnon   – started posing a crucial question: from a purely economic point of view, what is the optimal area for a single currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Optimum Currency Area   theory that ensued is well-known to you all and I don’t have to say much about it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is not easy to summarise the many views on the euro area as an OCA, or to sum up the vast volume of empirical studies of all OCA criteria for European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro area may not yet be an optimum currency area in all respects to the extent that, for example, the United States is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">On the other hand, it scores quite highly under several OCA criteria – such as economic openness, diversification in production and consumption, degree of price stability, and several elements of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In the areas where it scores less well – such as price and wage flexibility, and some facets of financial integration – remedies are being sought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We can expect contributions on these issues in all the sessions of the workshop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">How could EMU affect the optimality of the euro currency area over time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Andrew Rose and Jeffrey Frankel   offered an important new forward-looking perspective strengthening the OCA argument in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">By studying the effects of several currency unions that occurred in the past, they showed that monetary integration leads to a significant deepening of reciprocal trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The implication for EMU is that the euro area may turn into an optimum currency area after the launch of monetary integration, even if it was not an OCA before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In other words, to quote Rose and Frankel: “countries which join EMU, no matter what their motivation may be, may satisfy OCA properties ex-post even if they do not ex-ante!” This has been termed the “endogeneity of optimum currency area” effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Several authors have brought forward concepts similar to the above hypothesis of the “endogeneity of OCA”, but in areas other than trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Artis and Zhang have discussed the endogeneity of symmetry of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Blanchard and Wolfers, and Saint Paul and Bentolila, have discussed the endogeneity of labour market institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen and Yosha discuss the effects of sharing a single currency on financial markets and insurance schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">Therefore, there may be diverse sources of “endogeneities of OCA.” Such endogeneities can be seen as a set of processes triggered by the start of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Hence, monetary union may help to set in motion forces bringing countries closer together, forces that were not present   before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.16,0)">To be fair, various other issues may arise in the years ahead that could render the verdict more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Some authors, such as Krugman in his “Lessons from Massachusetts”, postulate a “concentration” hypothesis: the euro, together with stronger trade and financial ties, will result in greater specialisation of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.75,0)">This may gradually intensify inter-industry trade, and cause each country to become more sensitive to industry-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.31,0)">In turn, more idiosyncratic business cycles would result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.7,0)">Hence, if the forces of concentration prevail, euro area countries may witness more pronounced growth, employment and inflation differentials than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">This could be a concern in view of the generally limited price and wage flexibility, low labour mobility and the lack of a risk-sharing mechanism due to the still incipient financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">Time will judge the severity of this potential effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">European political integration I now turn to the third side of the original triangle: political integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">With EMU, the Maastricht Treaty has created a unique, asymmetry in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On one hand, there is a supranational European monetary order, but on the other hand, there are predominantly national sovereignties in other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Given my previous reflections, I would like to distinguish between two complementary aspects of political integration, namely: the political will that has been at the base of the process of European integration; and the institutional side of political integration that consists of the political arrangements, laws and rules regulating economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I shall now pose two questions and try not to give real answers but share with you some reflections: a) Given that we now have an economic and monetary union but do not yet have a definitive form of political union, can Monetary Union continue to thrive?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">My answer is a resounding and clear YES.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.83,0)">EMU can proceed for the time being without a fully-fledged political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">For my contribution to the International Research Forum, which we organised a few weeks ago, I chose the title: “One size fits all!” However, for “one size to fit all” and the lasting success of the single monetary policy to be guaranteed, we need a steady political support from all member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This will is necessary not least in order to further raise the OCA rating of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.7,0)">At present we see tensions concerning the impact of the single monetary policy on countries in economic and political terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.29,0)">The ECB’s stability-oriented approach is perceived by some as a “straitjacket.” The fiscal framework – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">the Stability and Growth Pact – is being heavily tested in several countries, including Italy, France and Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is only partly surprising: a critical situation had to be expected sooner or later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.19,0)">In my view, several countries did not fully understand what signing the Maastricht Treaty and joining EMU would imply in many areas – from fiscal policy to product and labour markets, and price and wage-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.83,0)">A relatively low score for some OCA criteria – such as price and wage flexibility and labour mobility – must not be a “given”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Instead, it can and must be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is now high time for national governments that have not done so convincingly to undertake the urgently needed structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">These reforms are fundamental to enhance price and wage flexibility and adaptability, as well as to foster innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Hence, EMU needs to catalyse reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We will hear tomorrow in Session 4 the extent to which this may or may not happen, and the reasons why we need to understand to what extent monetary union can be a “catalyst” for reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The Lisbon agenda must be actively pursued; this agenda is important by itself, but also with regard to improving conditions for a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">b) To what extent can EMU be supported by the current stage of political integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">My answer is: substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Euro area countries have already transferred diverse areas of national sovereignty to the supranational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This includes sovereignty over monetary and exchange rate policies, as I have already mentioned, but also the framework for microeconomic policies in the areas of the Single Market, competition and trade policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Hence, the euro area   countries already share important elements of state formation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Despite the recent rejection of the new Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, political integration is bound to deepen over time: it must because of the interdependencies that I referred to previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let us not forget that EMU is not the only vehicle driving change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">In all countries, some of the main traditional functions of the state are steadily changing under diverse pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.53,0)">The pressure of globalisation, the growing role of knowledge and innovation, and the deepening of economic and financial interdependence are now affecting economic sovereignty and security, as well as national identity and culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.49,0)">This has led to tensions and adjustment processes: that is why we now have the current “crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.15,0)">Some final reflections Coming to the end of my reflections, I shall return to the beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">European integration started with a small group of countries and, for several years, it was nurtured as a “western European project” that achieved a high degree of economic integration, a functioning monetary union and several elements of political integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">On the final stage of the integration process, the steady state of political union in Europe, one could only speculate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For me, none of the examples of history, be they a federation of states or a union of nations, can serve as a blueprint for shaping political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The EU has always been, and will remain for quite some time, a unique undertaking for which no models exist that can easily be adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Something new will emerge – and it is important to allow a process which is open for further steps forward while at the same time safeguarding what is already in place and working properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The fall of the iron curtain cleared the way for the major enlargement that took place last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Now European integration encompasses a large part of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.33,0)">Where does this leave the ECB and the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We are very eager to hear your views on what effects EMU is having on the euro area and its member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">If Europe is to seize the opportunities that Monetary Union presents, it must use EMU as a catalyst for necessary reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The lasting success of EMU and the chance to reap its benefits now depend primarily on the ability of each country to undertake its own reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">At the same time, the single monetary policy would, of course, be facilitated by greater homogeneity and greater flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">If we think in terms of European history, the fact that we have come this far is an incredible achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">We should never forget that European integration has been driven by the political will to overcome centuries of hostility and war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.59,0)">Moreover, we have had difficult times and crises before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And we have always found ways to overcome them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">If the past is our guide to what the future will bring, we should remain confident that we will also find answers to our current problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Germany is currently celebrating “Schiller Year”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In his inaugural lecture at the University of Jena in 1789, Schiller stated: “Die europäische Staatengemeinschaft scheint in eine große Familie verwandelt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Die Hausgenossen können einander anfeinden, aber hoffentlich nicht mehr zerfleischen.”   “The European community of states seems to have turned into a big family.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.77,0)">Although hostile attitudes may prevail among the fellow tenants, they shall, hopefully, no longer tear each other apart.” Schiller was unfortunately wrong as far as the subsequent centuries were concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But it is now time to make sure that Schiller is right in this century and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Source: “Was heißt und
