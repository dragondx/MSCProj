    <span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)"> The role of money: Money and monetary policy in the twenty-first century Introductory remarks by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBheld at Fourth ECB Central Banking ConferenceFrankfurt am Main, 9 November 2006 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all to the fourth ECB central banking conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We are all here to discuss the role of money and monetary analysis in the monetary policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This remains a crucial topic, of the utmost importance to all central banks, whatever strategy they pursue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Bearing this in mind, I would like to thank all of you for coming to Frankfurt today to share with us your own experiences and views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The organisers have put together an impressive conference agenda and I trust that we will all benefit from the anticipated full and frank exchange on the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The Swiss economist Jürg Niehans once characterised central banking as being “an art rather than a science”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.38,0)">At least to me, this implies that we will never find definitive answers to the questions surrounding the design and implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Rather, progress is made by identifying the key challenges and finding appropriate and practical responses that meet the circumstance of the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So, given that time is limited, let me take the opportunity to come straight to the key substantive questions that I think we face at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I see three main issues: First , what is the information in monetary developments that is relevant for the conduct of a monetary policy aimed at the maintenance of price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second , how should the analysis of money be organised so that it is appropriately captured in the process leading to interest rate decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Third , how should the monetary analysis and its implications for monetary policy be presented to the financial markets and public?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the following remarks, I will try to address each of these issues in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Let me start with the first question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Central banks throughout the world have been assigned responsibility for keeping inflation at low and stable rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In the euro area, the Maastricht Treaty gave the ECB a clear mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In my view, analysing monetary developments seems to be a necessary component of any monetary policy strategy aimed at preserving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.1,0)">Since money serves to define the unit of account, monetary developments must be integral to the determination of the price level and thus the rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">Or – as the Governor of the Bank of England recently usefully reminded us – without money there can be no inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.65,0)">One cannot deny that there are many practical problems in analysing and interpreting the relationship between money and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">That has certainly been the ECB’s experience in the euro area over the past eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Some of these practical challenges will be addressed in the discussions at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But we should not let such practicalities obscure the fundamental principles of monetary economics and central banking that have prevailed, for good reason, over many decades and centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">To begin with, the long-run relationship between money and prices is perhaps one of the best documented results in all economics, in both the theoretical and empirical literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">A multitude of empirical studies have confirmed the high correlation between monetary growth and inflation, both across time and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Moreover, the evidence strongly supports the view that this correlation tends to increase when inflation and monetary dynamics are considered over longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Thus the theory implying that money and prices should move together at least over the longer run is strongly supported by the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.96,0)">Against this background, it would certainly be very unwise to ignore monetary developments and their connection to inflation dynamics in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This is widely recognised by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB organised a central bank workshop on monetary analysis in November 2000, the proceedings of which are available on the ECB’s website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This exercise confirmed that all leading central banks analyse monetary developments as part of the process underlying monetary policy decisions – and it seems to me for good reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Unfortunately, this has not been recognised in the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At least in Europe, a lot of effort has been expended in addressing the rather trivial question of whether monetary analysis should play a role in monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Such effort would have been better focused on the more meaningful issue of how to conduct a monetary analysis that will support monetary policy decisions aimed at the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In this context, I look forward to the presentations of Prof. Woodford and Prof. Christiano on this issue, which look set to stimulate a lively debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The question of how to analyse money naturally brings me to the second issue I have identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Before describing how we have organised the monetary analysis at the ECB, let me briefly recall the roles that such analysis can be expected to play in disciplining the monetary policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">First, assigning a prominent role to money is a useful tool to underpin the medium-term orientation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.74,0)">Taking policy decisions and evaluating their consequences only on the basis of the short-term indications stemming from the analysis of economic variables would be mis-guided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Assessing the trend evolution of monetary aggregates and liquidity allows a central bank to broaden its analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In particular, it often helps central banks to see beyond the transient impact of the various shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.5,0)">Therefore, it avoids setting monetary policy on an incompletely informed – and thus potentially destabilising – course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, evaluating the money stock and liquidity situation helps to ensure that central banks look at developments in the level of key nominal variables, and not just their rate of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As several recent academic papers have emphasised, maintaining such an orientation can help to stabilise private sector inflation expectations and thus serve the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This literature is a restatement of the traditional view that money can serve as a “nominal anchor” for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monetary policy “targets” – or, more broadly speaking, monetary policy strategies – should be understood in their specific context and in the light of the historical evolution of the institution that designs and announces them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Tomorrow’s presentation by Prof. Flandreau will emphasise this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With this in mind, we should recall that the start of Monetary Union in 1999 was an entirely novel event and, partly as a consequence, had to address considerable uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.18,0)">The ECB, as a brand new central bank, lacked an established track record of success in maintaining price stability and therefore had to inspire confidence and build its own credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In this context, it was imperative that the ECB established a policy framework – a strategy – to govern and guide its actions, so as to reassure the general public in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy announced in October 1998 explicitly recognised the importance of monetary analysis by assigning “a prominent role to money”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">More precisely, the analysis of risks to price stability is based on two complementary perspectives on the determination of the risks to price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The first perspective is aimed at identifying the economic shocks driving the business cycle and thus embodies a thorough assessment of the cyclical dynamics of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.97,0)">This is the “economic analysis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second perspective   models of the economy, by introducing a variety of so-called “financial frictions” into these models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These models are admittedly elegant from a theoretical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">They are based on fully developed micro-foundations and have the potential to offer a behavioural interpretation of developments in the monetary aggregates beyond that which is feasible with the conventional money demand frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, their practical use in the monetary policy process in general, and for monetary analysis in particular, is only starting and deserves further investigation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Finally, a number of papers have shown that an analysis of money and credit developments can provide advance information of the build-up of asset price misalignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.71,0)">Historically, asset price “bubble” episodes which have been accompanied by strong money and credit dynamics have often been followed by “crashes” involving large downturns in output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Monitoring money and credit aggregates can, therefore, help to identify the build-up of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Without anticipating all the conclusions that, together, we will draw from the body of very stimulating work to be presented at this conference, let me share with you, albeit in synthetic form and yet still preliminary, my reading of this impressive body of literature written since the Governing Council’s evaluation of the ECB’s strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Overall, this work supports the view that analysing money is important for monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.55,0)">But it also suggests that integrating the monetary and economic analysis into a single analytical framework remains a difficult challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Attempts to do so – exemplified by the DSGE models mentioned above – although welcome and necessary, have yet to replicate the richness of the ECB’s approach to monetary analysis and hence to monetary policy over the past eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy – with its two pillar structure – thus remains a practical and workable response to the challenge facing central banks in ensuring that the information in monetary developments is appropriately captured in the policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.39,0)">Turning to the third issue that I mentioned at the outset, we should recognise that the complexity of conducting monetary analysis in real time runs the risk of making that analysis difficult for the public to understand and interpret.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the ECB, we have always striven to be transparent in the presentation of the monetary analysis and its role in monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.2,0)">But such transparency has sometimes come at the expense of complexity, which may occasionally have obscured the key policy-relevant message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">How to communicate the results of the monetary analysis in a simple – but not simplistic – way is a topic that deserves further research and will be central in maintaining the importance of monetary developments in the presentation of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.9,0)">We have often been confronted with the question of how much “weight” is assigned to the monetary analysis in the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.81,0)">Such a question is typically motivated by the observed negative relationship between policy interest rates and monetary growth in the euro area, especially in the period between 2001 and 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Addressing this critique provide an insight into the communication challenges faced by the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.4,0)">As the paper by Fischer, Lenza, Pill and Reichlin demonstrates, assigning a “weight” to the monetary analysis is a simplistic and misleading way of characterising how such analysis has influenced monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.17,0)">The role played by money in interest rate decisions has varied over time, as the clarity and reliability of the policy-relevant signal coming from monetary developments has fluctuated, both in its own terms and relative to the signal stemming from the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.22,0)">What I can assure you is that the Governing Council has thoroughly engaged in the analysis of monetary issues and has not simply dropped money from its deliberations when the signals offered by the monetary analysis were puzzling or discomforting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Throughout, the Governing Council has fulfilled its commitment, as embodied in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, to analyse closely and assess their relevance for interest rate decisions, while eschewing any mechanical response to the evolution of a particular aggregate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This was made clear already, when the strategy was presented to the public in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This brings me to my final point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In economic and monetary research, it is necessarily the case that new and more sophisticated methods are continuously being developed and applied in various areas, both related and unrelated to monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Indeed, scientific progress is possible because new research addresses the shortcomings of previous models or analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The academic journals most typically reward novelty and increased sophistication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">However, as central bankers, we often recognise that these new methods, techniques and models are not without their own problems and indeed, often share many of the problems of the “old” or more traditional methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In this context, we ought to keep in mind that the new methods, techniques and models used should respect those fundamental principles of monetary economics and central banking that have survived the test of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The issue is not so much to discard “old” methods in favour of “new” ones, but rather to harness new methods to serve the role of monetary analysis in shaping monetary policy to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Monetary analysis is a field that has proven essential to central banks for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">We, therefore, need to invest further in it in the future, making the best use of the new tools without neglecting the trusted principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Against this background, we look forward to a stimulating two days of discussion and debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">I trust that you will also benefit and take new ideas and approaches back to academia, central banks and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I wish us well in our endeavours, both over the next few days and beyond.</span>
