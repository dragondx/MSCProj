    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)"> Jointly shaping Europe’s tomorrow Introductory remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly, 21 September 2020 Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2020 Dear President Schäuble, Dear President Ferrand, Honourable Members of the Franco-German Assembly, I would like to thank you very warmly for inviting me to join you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">As President of the European Central Bank and a French citizen living and working in Germany, it is an honour to speak at this historic forum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This parliamentary assembly is an embodiment of the special relationship between our two countries and their commitment to European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I find it essential that the ECB constantly engages in two-way communication, especially with citizens’ representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We need to make sure that the ECB’s voice is heard by the people and that the people’s voice is heard by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is why events like today’s are so important for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Our regular interlocutor is the European Parliament, to whom we are accountable under the Treaty for our monetary policy tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Transnational settings like this one give us a further chance to look past nation-specific concerns as we discuss Europe’s future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.14,0)">The coronavirus   pandemic is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Many of you will recognise the famous words of Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European project, who said: “Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises” .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">This pandemic has proven him right once more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Undoubtedly, Europe has been strengthened during this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">But Europe now has the opportunity to show that it can be more than the sum of the solutions adopted in this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Once again, Monnet’s words offer inspiration: “Europe itself is only a step towards the forms of organisation of the world of tomorrow”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">With these words in mind, we must seize this invaluable opportunity to strengthen our Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">We must shape the recovery from this crisis in such a way that our economies are fit for the world of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.64,0)">The unique strength of the European project The pandemic and the measures to contain the spread of the virus have caused a contraction in euro area economic activity that is unprecedented in peacetime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.59,0)">While incoming data suggest that we will see a strong rebound during the third quarter , the strength of the recovery remains very uncertain, as well as uneven and incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">It continues to be highly dependent on the future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">One major reason why we can expect a rebound in activity in the second half of the year is because, when faced with the largest economic shock since the Second World War, Europe and its leaders showed the unique strength of the European project: by acting together, we can achieve more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The ECB has played its part in this collective effort in the face of an unprecedented crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The nature of the pandemic shock called for an extraordinary monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme   to help stabilise financial markets and ease our monetary policy stance considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The PEPP is temporary, targeted and proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It addresses the specific shock at hand, and aims to repair the economic damage and the resulting downward pressures on inflation wrought by the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In addition, it was also vital that we limited the risk of a credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">So we substantially eased the conditions under which banks can obtain liquidity under our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Banks can now borrow from the ECB at interest rates which can reach -1%, under the condition that they are lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Six months after we introduced our measures, our policy package has stabilised markets, protected the supply of credit and supported the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This, in turn, should support the return of inflation towards our medium-term objective and safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">At the same time, the uncertainty of the current environment requires a very careful assessment of the incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.29,0)">When you look at the past six months, the ECB has not been the only game in town.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our measures have been complemented by forceful fiscal responses at both national and European levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This has been a critically important factor in alleviating the impact of the pandemic on the labour market and on banks’ lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">We judge that the economy still needs that support if the recovery is to continue and strengthen further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Ambitious fiscal measures by national governments were complemented by a €540 billion European safety net.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">And with the Next Generation EU fund, Europe took a decisive step forwards as the crisis evolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">For the first time, a common budgetary instrument at European level can be used to complement fiscal stabilisers at national level, even if it is currently only temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">As a result, we now have an aggregate policy mix in which fiscal and monetary policy reinforce each other in supporting the recovery, and thus underpin medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The case for jointly shaping Europe’s future We must now carry this positive momentum forwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">It is time for Europe to move beyond the initial priority of containing the immediate impact of the crisis and shape a common vision for its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The pandemic has the potential to accelerate trends that were already emerging before the crisis; trends that will lead to structural changes in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In a world where technological change and geopolitical tensions are transforming the geography of value chains, we should make full use of the size and diversity of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">If we strengthen Economic and Monetary Union and deepen the Single Market, we do not only benefit all Europeans by improving the way we produce, distribute and consume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">We also increase our autonomy and ensure that Europe is better protected in the world of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As legislators, you have a crucial role to play in designing policies that can revitalise our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Digitalisation is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">We need to fully reap the potential gains from digital technologies and, at the same time, make sure labour markets remain inclusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.38,0)">If we don’t, we risk creating a new divide, and we can already see gaps opening up when we look at differences in wages, education levels and gender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">By implementing the right set of national and European policies, we will achieve more together than we can alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">At national level, we need to make the necessary changes to labour, product and financial market regulations, and invest in education to reduce digital exclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">At European level, this should be complemented by accelerating progress towards the Digital Single Market to help deliver economies of scale for digital firms, while addressing key concerns around cybersecurity and data protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In a more digital economy, we also need to ensure the strength and autonomy of European payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The Eurosystem is actively pursuing initiatives to achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We are also exploring the benefits, risks and operational challenges of introducing a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">A digital euro could be a complement to, not a substitute for, cash; it could provide an alternative to private digital currencies and ensure that sovereign money remains at the core of European payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The pandemic has also clearly refocused people’s attention on the environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We cannot miss this opportunity to reduce and prevent climate risks and finance the necessary green transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All of the available evidence shows that climate-related risks are real and have major consequences for our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.14,0)">A disorderly transition to a low-carbon economy could pose systemically relevant risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Given how interconnected our financial sector is, we need to address these risks together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will also provide new opportunities for growth, which can be unlocked by ambitious investment programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The EU will need up to €470 billion of additional investment every year to reach its current climate and environmental policy goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Next Generation EU will strengthen the role of public budgets in green infrastructure financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">At the same time, the transition can only be successful if the private sector contributes as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The financial system should be a catalyst for this change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Policymakers should thus create the necessary conditions for the financial sector to do what it does best: allocate capital where it is most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The renewed sustainable finance strategy announced by the European Commission should help to ensure that externalities associated with climate change are correctly reflected in prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">At the same time, we need to remove all obstacles to the development of a cross-border market for sustainable financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In other words, we need to finally complete the banking union and create a genuine capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">And deep and liquid capital markets will also go a long way towards strengthening the international role of the euro and bolstering Europe’s strategic autonomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Everybody needs to be ready for the profound changes currently sweeping our economies and our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The ECB’s ongoing strategy review will ensure that its monetary policy strategy is fit for purpose, both today and in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Listening to European citizens’ expectations and better understanding their economic concerns and expectations before making decisions is an important part of this review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">If the right actions are taken now, this crisis can be an opportunity for us to create the conditions for more inclusive, greener and more digital growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">To come back to Jean Monnet’s words, this crisis can be an opportunity for Europe to take a step towards the forms of organisation of the world of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Almost 60 years ago to the day – on 23 September 1960 – the Europe Bridge crossing the Rhine between Kehl and Strasbourg was inaugurated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">It has become a symbol of how close our two countries have become.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The success of the Franco-German “bridge” was clearly reflected in the pain caused to families, businesses and commuters by the closure of the Franco-German border at the height of the pandemic, as many of you know all too well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The challenge in front of us is not only to build “bridges” between European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">We also need to build bridges to the future and shape a recovery that makes our economies fit for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But bridges need solid foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Europe’s future must be built on strong democratic legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Europe’s citizens must be at the centre of the debate about the Europe that we want to build as we emerge from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">As their elected representatives, you, together with the European Parliament, have a crucial role to play in making their
