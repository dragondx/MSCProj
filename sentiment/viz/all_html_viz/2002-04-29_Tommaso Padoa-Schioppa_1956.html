    <span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)"> Competition, co-operation, public action: Three necessary drivers for European financial integration Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, dinner speech for the launching workshop of the ECB-CFS research network on "Capital markets and financial integration in Europe", Frankfurt am Main, 29 April 2002 I am pleased to be here tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As you can imagine, and as the launching of this workshop indicates, the European Central Bank follows very closely the developments of European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Financial integration plays a major role in the areas of monetary policy, supervision, financial stability, market operations and payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">We expect the Workshop that is launched with this meeting to foster research on European financial markets and to increase awareness and understanding of the issues at stake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">By channelling funds from agents who have a surplus to those who have a shortage of savings, well structured and well regulated financial markets contribute to an efficient allocation of resources, to reduce the cost of capital, allow for risk-diversification and risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Their structure, functioning, regulation and supervision are therefore crucial for the long run economic performance of an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.94,0)">Market segmentation - the opposite of integration - is associated with high transaction costs, reduced liquidity, inefficiencies in resource allocation, low growth potential and ineffective transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This explains the strong focus of the ECB and other European authorities on promoting financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It also explain the great interest the ECB-CFS Research Network on "Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe " has raised both among academics and official institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Twenty years ago, I suggested how it was impossible to "aim simultaneously at i) free trade, ii) capital mobility, iii) independent domestic monetary policies, and iv) fixed exchange rates".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.22,0)">At the time, the inconsistency was mainly resolved by the absence of a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.92,0)">Twenty years ago there were, particularly in the financial sector, all sorts of barriers segmenting national markets: foreign exchange controls, restrictions to capital mobility, no freedom to offer banking and other services across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Later in the 1980s, the high road to reconcile the "inconsistent quartet" was taken, by completing the single market, liberalising capital movements and finally planning complete monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.54,0)">The "planning" was followed by the "doing".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The single currency and its central bank, the Eurosystem, came into being and, with the recent successful introduction of banknotes and coins, this long journey - which has occupied most of my professional life - has come to "an" endpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The euro can indeed be considered as the crowning achievement of the European Single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I said "an" endpoint and not "the" endpoint, because the multiplicity of currencies   was a major factor of segmentation of the financial system and of the European economy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Thus, only with the introduction of the euro was a main obstacle to integration removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And hence, it is right to say that the euro marks not only a crowning, but also the beginning of an integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">There is indeed a new and growing academic literature that recognises the impact of currency unification on market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As suggested by Andrew Rose's thought-provoking title, "One money, one market", times are ripe to reverse what had become a slogan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">There are clear signs that the single currency fosters the formation of a single financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">By increasing price transparency, reducing transaction costs, and ultimately stimulating competition, the single currency is acting as a powerful catalyst to complete the integration process foremost   in the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Significant progress has already occurred in the area of securities markets, the most remarkable example being represented by money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Bond and equity markets are moving towards further integration as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">While ending the transition towards monetary unification, the single currency must therefore be regarded as the starting point towards further financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, if today we are here discussing the future of the European financial system, it's precisely because - in the euro area - we share the same currency, the same central bank and the same source of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The financial sector - unlike, say, the manufacturing sector - can be called a "system"   first and foremost because it is tied together by the same single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Network externalities are relevant for financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Size matters, and the more traders, investors and borrowers use a system, the more valuable it becomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.67,0)">Strong network effects and high switching costs, however, have the potential to create "lock-in" situations: since it is expensive to switch from one system to another, existing conventions and market practices might be self-reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.6,0)">This seems to be exactly the problem of today's European financial industry, which is still a half way house between a collection of   systems and a single system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Different conventions and infrastructures are the result of decades of evolution and actions by market participants and public authorities within the national framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They survive the advent of the euro as an integrating factor because it is quite costly for their users to abandon them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.44,0)">Market forces alone may not be able, at least in the short run, to drive financial integration forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As times for "inconsistencies" are gone, tonight I would like to use the catchword "necessary trinity" to state that, in my opinion, the completion of the financial integration process requires the interaction between three   drivers: i) competition, ii) co-operation and iii) public action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Free competition across borders permits market forces to push towards greater integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Co-operation is needed to overcome situations where the optimal outcome is not achieved by the simple interaction of independent individual decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.25,0)">And finally, public action is called for where a public good is at stake or, more generally, a market or a co­ ordination failure occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Behind each of these three drivers there is a distinct and well-defined motivation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.98,0)">Competition results from the selfish behaviour of market participants and is driven by the search for profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.47,0)">Co-operation stems from the awareness of market participants that externalities might impede the realisation of benefits for all firms operating in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And public action is motivated by the public interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Whoever, like myself, holds the view that freedom and responsibility should pervade economic life, is inclined to let market forces do as much as they can to transform the structure of the market in an optimal way, not only to carry on activity within a given market structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But I also think it is crucial to be aware that market-led progress towards integration does require co­ operation among economic   agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In Euroland, not less   than in my much longer service as national policy maker, almost every day brings evidence that competition does not suffice to produce the desired equilibrium of full integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Co-operation is needed, to mention just a few cases, in developing payment and other market standards, adopting pricing conventions, consolidating clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Also the driver of co-operation should be, as much as possible, moved by the private sector, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">by an enlightened perception of the private interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, here again, to hold this principle, and to strive for its implementation in practice, cannot make us blind to the fact that the necessary co-operation among private market participants does not materialise unless public authorities play an important role in promoting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">At the same time, of course, the authorities need to provide genuine public goods such as price stability and a competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In conclusion, all the three drivers are needed, and there is a significant interplay between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the following, I will elaborate this general idea by going through a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.61,0)">The first example concerns securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The costs associated with building an integrated market infrastructure for securities settlement would not necessarily accrue to those who stand to benefit the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.59,0)">Mechanisms to compensate those bearing the costs may be difficult to devise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.53,0)">Further, in the short run some market participants may even benefit   from fragmentation and, hence, lack the incentive to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.53,0)">Under these circumstances, one cannot expect competition to work, as too few players and too many externalities are involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Co-ordination is needed to foster a sensible private sector outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The ECB is positioned to act as a catalyst, as it did for the EONIA rate, which was developed with its active contribution and then adopted as the market benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">The second example concerns the retail activity of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">The typical customers of a bank are households and small firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Therefore, linguistic factors, cultural habits and customer proximity will inevitably keep loan and deposit activities locally rooted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The U.S. experience indeed suggests that geographical segmentation might remain a distinctive feature of European retail banking for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">However, new technological advances might cause a widening of the playing field of competition here too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.28,0)">Public action may not be needed as much as in other segments of the financial sector, because the case for recognising a market failure may not be strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Yet, public authorities may play a useful role, for example by imposing standards on customer information, in order to generate consumers' trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.81,0)">A third and last example concerns financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Here, problems and central areas for public action have been identified by the Commission's Action Plan, and by the recent work of the Economic and Financial Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.57,0)">Important obstacles stem from differences in national tax systems as well as in supervisory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Items on the agenda are the reform of corporate take-over legislation, generating efficient, fair and expedient rules for the transfer of ownership of corporations, as well as the taxation of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">On the regulatory side, the recommendations of the Lamfalussy Committee of Wise Men have started to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The ECB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators have established a joint group aiming to identify common standards for securities settlement systems at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Public action, as I said, is an integral component of the "necessary trinity", a driver that cannot be missing if further progress in financial integration - that is desirable, and that only the advent of the euro really permits - is to occur in the coming two or three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The contribution of public action, however, may not be as easy and straightforward as a textbook   case would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.72,0)">Indeed a distinctive feature of the euro area is the problematic meaning of the term "public".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.95,0)">"Public" are the actions of the individual countries and national authorities of the European Union, and "public" also are the actions of European institutions, where those same countries and authorities obviously play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In a multi-country context, national authorities may not always be the natural promoters of further integration, since their perspective is often mainly domestic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.14,0)">This complicates the functioning of public action as the third driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.63,0)">And since the three drivers are all needed, this also complicates the process of further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">With the above examples I tried to illustrate the crucial importance of the interplay between competition, co-operation and public actions for a successful integration of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Actions by market participants, I repeat, should be the primary driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">Whenever market forces fail to remove relevant obstacles to integration, public authorities may intervene either to remove the obstacles, or to act as a catalyst to complete the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, they have to act to provide genuine public goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Hence, public agents need to have a broad view of the necessary policies in support of integration, focus not just on lifting the remaining regulatory obstacles, but also on the co-operative arrangements among private agents and maintaining effective competition to the benefit of the users of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Because of their European mandate, the ECB and the European Commission are in a good position to foster beneficial co-operation in the market place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In furthering the agenda, applied and empirical research has an important role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Studies like the one of the European Commission about the development of indicators and methodologies to measure the evolution of financial market integration are most welcomed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In the light of the framework I presented to you tonight, it would be important to also study how the interaction between co-operation and competition can work towards an efficient market structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">This brings forward other questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.39,0)">Is the persistence of different conventions due to lack of competition, regulatory obstacles, or failure of co-ordination?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.79,0)">What are the trade-offs between the use of competition and co-operation in fostering financial integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Are co­ operative solutions going to decrease or even drive away competition among agents?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Will this reduce incentives for product innovation and cost control?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If so, how can the public authorities address this problem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">I am sure that by bringing together academics and researchers from official institutions, the new Research Network on "Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe " can play a significant role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">It can promote fruitful exchanges of ideas, create new synergies and give a decisive contribution to our understanding of the functioning of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I wish you a very productive collaboration and I look forward to hearing about the progress of the Network.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Padoa-Schioppa  , Address to the 'Second Symposium of European Banks', reprinted in
