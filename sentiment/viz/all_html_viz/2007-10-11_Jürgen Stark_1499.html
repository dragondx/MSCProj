    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)"> Productivity, structural reforms and globalisation Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBdelivered at the UnternehmerforumBrussels, 11 October 2007 It is a great pleasure to be here today and talk to you about the economic situation and outlook for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.67,0)">Nowadays the two big questions which many people have in mind when they think about this topic are: is the euro area economy at a turning point?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">And: what can we do to move to a path of high, sustainable growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In my presentation, I will share some thoughts with you and provide some tentative answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will look at these issues from a particular angle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">First, I would like to discuss the recent economic developments and the uncertainty we face regarding the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">Part of the uncertainty relates to the assessment of labour productivity developments, which will be the main topic of the second part of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Labour productivity is a, or even the, driving force behind economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.74,0)">Assessing trends in labour productivity is therefore important, but it remains also a complicated task in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">I will provide you with some evidence which shapes our assessment of recent productivity developments and put it into the context of the long-term slowdown that can be observed for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Future productivity performance will depend on the ability of governments to put into place the right policies and the ability of euro area economies to cope with the challenges of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This topic will conclude my talk today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">1 Euro area economic performance since 2006 and outlook Growth in economic activity in the euro area accelerated during 2006 and remained strong in the first half of 2007 after a prolonged period of subdued growth, which began in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Global economic growth was very dynamic, in particular in emerging Asia and with high growth rates in the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Moreover, different domestic demand components gained momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Investment dynamics benefited from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Consumption also strengthened further, in line with the developments in real disposable income, which was increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Employment in the euro area increased by more than two million in 2006, an increase which was in line with the pattern of economic growth and contained real wages reflecting the impact of recent labour market policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Employment growth was fairly evenly spread across age, gender and skill groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">It was marked by a significant rise in both permanent and full-time jobs and stopped the decline in employment among low-skilled workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.43,0)">Thus it went beyond the increase in the employment rate among female and older workers as well as temporary and part-time job ratios observable in previous years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The strength of employment growth also translated into a sizeable reduction in the unemployment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Turning to more recent developments, much of the information that has become available confirms the good fundamentals of the euro area economy as well as the sustained pace of economic growth, although it has moderated slightly from the rates observed in the second half of 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, preliminary data for the third quarter show strong industrial production and growth in the services sector remains solid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Also, labour market dynamics continue to be robust, thereby supporting private consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Corporate earnings and profitability have also been sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.18,0)">Data on activity from various confidence indicators and indicator-based estimates have declined but remain favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.37,0)">Survey indicators for the euro area services sector deteriorated on account of disappointing recent demand and the EC survey on consumer and business confidence dropped in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.61,0)">The decline in confidence was reflected in all sectors apart from construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">While financial market volatility appears to have contributed to this decline, these indicators remain above their historical averages and therefore continue to point to sustained growth during the second half of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The recent financial turmoil has generally raised the degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Particular caution needs to be exercised when assessing any impact of financial market developments on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It thus remains necessary to gather additional information and examine new data before drawing further conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.06,0)">The overall impact will depend on spillovers from the effects of financial market turbulence on the US economy and on global demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">In the euro area, it will largely depend on how the upheaval affects financing conditions and domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.27,0)">Regarding demand in the euro area, I already mentioned that, at this stage, there is little evidence of an impact beyond the decline in confidence indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">As for financing conditions, in our view the higher risk premia now embedded in stock prices and corporate bond prices largely reflect a correction of the past under-appreciation of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Debt and equity financing costs in markets and via monetary and financial institutions have increased in recent months, although corporate bond spreads are still not exceptionally high by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Moreover, heightened financial uncertainty seems, so far, to have led only to a limited ‘flight to safety’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Credit growth to households and especially corporations remains strong, although this may reflect, in part, the re-intermediation of financing onto bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.61,0)">The results of the October 2007 Bank Lending Survey suggest that euro area banks tightened somewhat credit standards applied to loans to households and firms in the third quarter of 2007 and expect to tighten them further in this quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, more data are required to obtain a more comprehensive view of the impact of the financial market turbulence on financing conditions and money as well as credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.34,0)">The uncertainty about financial institutions’ potential exposure to US sub-prime-related losses and to the valuation techniques of complicated structured credit products, however, does appear to have led to a lack of confidence among banks and thus tensions in the interbank money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The ECB immediately reacted to the market tensions and continues to contribute to the smooth operation of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Turning to global demand factors, global economic activity remains resilient so far despite the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The impact of the US economic slowdown on world demand   has been largely offset by robust economic growth in emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.98,0)">But the financial turmoil has increased downside risks to the global economic outlook, intensifying those already stemming from possible further increases in oil and commodity prices, rising protectionist pressures and broader concerns about global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.68,0)">Against this background, international organisations and private forecasters have in fact been recently revising their projections for economic growth slightly downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me now turn briefly to recent price developments and the outlook for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased strongly to 2.1% in September 2007, from 1.7% in August, having been below 2% for 12 consecutive months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A particularly strong effect from the decline of energy prices a year ago, combined with the recent substantial increase in oil prices, contributed significantly to this increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Owing to this effect, we are now entering a period during which we expect the inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the remaining months of 2007 and in early 2008, before moderating again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.65,0)">Looking at the performance of different HICP components shows that inflation remains high in unprocessed food – although it declined slightly to 2.4% in August – and in services prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The acceleration of services prices since the start of the year, now standing at an elevated level of 2.6% for the fourth consecutive month, is partly explained by the impact of the rise in German VAT, but is also linked to the better ability of firms to pass higher costs on to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Capacity utilisation has risen over the past two years for manufacturing and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Indicators suggest that it is still increasing in the services sector, and that price pressures along the production chain have strengthened further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">On food prices, I would like to make a small incidental remark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.53,0)">Food prices appear to be among the most important factors affecting the inflation perception of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In Germany, as in other countries, the strong attention paid to food prices was certainly also supported by the press coverage of the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.05,0)">The overall contribution of food prices to actual inflation, however, is limited by their weight in the overall euro area HICP, which is approximately 12% for processed food and 8% for unprocessed food.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.47,0)">This is one of the reasons why, at times, some discrepancies between the perceived inflation rate and actual inflation may emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Of course in our economic analysis, we have to take actual price developments and people’s expectations affecting their spending and savings behaviour into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.15,0)">Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">They continue to include the possibility of further increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products as well as additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.93,0)">Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the signs of a further tightening of labour markets, with labour shortages increasingly being mentioned in surveys as a source of concern in the industry and services sectors, suggests that stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This may be coupled with an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.3,0)">Such developments would pose upward risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB always cross-checks its assessment of price stability emerging from the economic analysis with the indications about medium to longer-term risks apparent from our monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Without going into the details – because some of the elements were already mentioned before, when I discussed financial market and credit conditions – let me just say that our current monetary analysis identifies continued strong underlying rates of money and credit expansion and thus confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The current experience indeed confirms again the usefulness of the ECB’s approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important during the current period of financial market volatility, as the latter may increase the focus on short-term behaviour and developments at the expense of the necessarily medium-term orientation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">At the same time, monetary and credit data can offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In this respect, monetary analysis adds significantly to the robustness of the assessment underlying our monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In sum, available data suggests that economic activity in the euro area may continue to expand at rates close to potential output growth in the second half of 2007 and 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The sound fundamentals of the euro area economy – notably the healthy financial situation of the corporate sector and the strong labour market – bode well for a smooth absorption of the recent financial market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Global economic activity is expected to remain robust and to provide support for euro area exports and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Consumption in the euro area should contribute to growth in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions remain supportive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At the same time, risks to price stability remain on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.72,0)">There is, nevertheless, a high margin of uncertainty surrounding this outlook and risks for the economy are on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.52,0)">They relate mainly to a potentially broader impact of the reappraisal of risk currently occurring in financial markets, possible disorderly developments related to global imbalances and protectionist pressures, as well as potential further oil and commodity price rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">2 Labour productivity developments in the euro area One piece of the information jigsaw that the ECB puts together in its assessment of the economic situation and the outlook is the development of labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">When we look at recent developments, data released by Eurostat in spring 2007 showed a clear acceleration in labour productivity growth   in 2006, reaching 1.4% growth compared with 0.7% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In year-on-year terms, labour productivity growth peaked at 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">At sectoral level, positive developments in labour productivity were mainly driven by developments in industry  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">However, labour productivity growth in the services sector also showed signs of improvement, recording an increase of 0.8% year on year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These positive developments were welcomed by some economists as a reversal of previous trends and were regarded as the outcome of the successful implementation of recent market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.13,0)">At the ECB, we were of the view that it was advisable to remain cautious as these developments may be cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">Unfortunately, the latest available national account data released by Eurostat in autumn 2007 have corroborated our concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.5,0)">The latest available data   show that labour productivity growth declined in the second quarter of 2007 and currently stands well below its peak at the end of 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.32,0)">What makes this development complicated, as I said before, is the fact that the assessment requires the short-term, cyclical element to be disentangled from the longer-term trends or structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.31,0)">Labour productivity – that is the output per unit of labour   – may change due to the amount of capital or machinery put at the service of workers, technological progress or managerial efficiency gains, or the current economic situation leading to higher or lower capacity utilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.47,0)">Disentangling the short and longer-term nature of changes in all these factors in real time is probably difficult at company level, but even more complex at an aggregate level for sectors and the economy at the whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In practice, we use a wide range of indicators, including some time-series techniques, for our assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.34,0)">Simple trend estimates extracted from macroeconomic time series tend to be unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Therefore, rather than focusing on one or more of these summary indicators, a real-time economic analysis of the degree of permanent changes in productivity   incorporates a broader set of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.56,0)">From this perspective, several available indicators corroborate our view that the recent developments have to be seen rather as a cyclical phenomenon and not necessarily as a change in the underlying trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">First, our own estimates of trend labour productivity suggest that the trend has not shifted upwards by a big margin, if at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Second, from a historical perspective, the pace of improvements in the services sector remains modest compared with that of the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Third, although there has been a pick-up in the contribution made by innovation and other efficiency gains to labour productivity growth, this remains subdued by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.71,0)">Furthermore, the contribution from capital deepening, namely the growth in capital used per unit of labour, further suggests that recent developments in labour productivity may very well be associated with a cyclical pick-up in investment activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">What makes the development important is the fact that productivity is a prime determinant of the speed of output growth per capita in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">As long as economies cannot expand their workforce and the amount of people employed indefinitely, growth has to come mainly from higher productivity through technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A trend increase in productivity should therefore be factored into our assessment of potential output and the current cyclical position of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.12,0)">Labour productivity growth has also direct implications for people’s wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Higher levels of long-term productivity growth through technological advances imply better investment opportunities in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">All else being equal, it should lead to lower prices and allow for higher wages, since workers are more productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.59,0)">This would increase people’s expected income and affect their patterns of consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.94,0)">From this perspective, the assessment that recent productivity figures do not clearly point to a major ‘break’ with past developments is somewhat disenchanting since the euro area has been characterised by a sustained decline in labour productivity growth since the early 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Measured per hour, labour productivity growth averaged 4.7% in the 1960s and 1970s, 2.2% in the 1980s and 1990s and around 1.3% at the beginning of this century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.77,0)">The slowdown in labour productivity growth in the euro area is a reflection of both lower growth in innovation and other efficiency gains   and lower growth in capital   used per unit of labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">From 1996 to 2004 the contribution to growth from capital deepening in the euro area was 0.9 percentage point, while it was 1.3 between 1980 and 1995.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">When assessing the long-term slowdown, we have to take into account the fact that the reduction in the growth rate of capital deepening can probably be seen as the flip side of the employment-rich growth which we experienced over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">This reflects an environment of wage moderation and progress with labour market reforms which may have partly reversed the earlier trend to substitute labour, which had become more expensive due to wage increases outpacing productivity gains, in favour of capital, in the 1980s and early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.65,0)">The slowdown appears more disappointing in view of the fact that it contrasts sharply with the very positive developments in labour productivity in other major economies, most noticeably the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The second half of the 1990s saw a period of sharp acceleration in productivity growth in the US  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In the eyes of many observers, this was caused primarily by the innovations in the information and communication technology   sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Together with the rapid pace of growth in the 1995-2000 period, it prompted some economists to suggest that the US economy was ready to pursue a new path of rapid growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">You will remember when the idea of a ‘new economy’ emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.59,0)">The rate of growth of GDP in the euro area in the second half of the 1990s was significantly lower than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Nonetheless, advocates of the new economy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">believers in the radical implications that the new technologies have for potential growth, suggested that similar developments on this side of the Atlantic were likely to take place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.63,0)">The question is why this did not materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The contributions from ICT technologies   to labour productivity growth come from three main sources: a direct contribution from the production of ICT capital, a direct contribution from the use of ICT capital in the production of goods and services, and indirectly from possible ‘spillover’ effects from the use of ICT capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">These ‘spillover’ effects amount, among other things, to the possibility of introducing more advanced management techniques in the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">When comparing the euro area with other major industrialised economies, we see   that the direct contribution from ICT capital increased in both periods between 1980 and 1995 and between 1995 and 2004 in the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom, but remains at a higher level in the United States and the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In addition, it is commonly acknowledged that the higher TFP growth, in particular in the US, reflects at least partly the spillovers from the development and adoption of ICT technologies as a so-called “general purpose technology” that affects the entire production sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.53,0)">When looking at euro area productivity at sectoral level, we do not find any immediate evidence for such spillover effects in the non-high-tech ICT producing sectors    : First, the performance of traditional non-high-tech manufacturing industries deteriorated significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.64,0)">This is responsible for most of the labour productivity slowdown in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.77,0)">Second, the performance of non-high-tech services remained weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">While its contribution in relative terms is not as sizeable as that from the traditional manufacturing industries, this, however, should come as little consolation, as in absolute terms, labour productivity growth in these services industries has remained subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This is the more so when compared with developments in the US, which saw a large acceleration in productivity, especially in these industries, over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.01,0)">Overall, there may be various forces underlying the slowdown, and I do not claim that my presentation provides a fully comprehensive picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.75,0)">From the pattern of slowdown in the euro area, we can nevertheless conclude, when comparing with other industrialised economies, that one major reason lies in the failure of major euro area countries to take full advantage of new technologies or, at least, their lagged adjustment to the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.98,0)">3 Productivity growth, market structure and globalisation 3.1 Market structure and productivity growth Why might Europe have been less able to participate in the productivity pick-up and is it doomed to follow a continued slowdown?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The performance of European countries can be traced back to existing policies and market rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Policies have changed over the last decade and the impact of these policy reforms is partly visible, but the structural reforms identified in the Lisbon agenda still have the potential to further increase both labour productivity growth and therefore the long-term growth potential of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Major structural reforms are obviously not easy to achieve and require a high degree of ‘national ownership’ and commitment to the reform objectives agreed under the Lisbon process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The initiative of entrepreneurs has often been essential – certainly in Germany – in putting reform proposals on the agenda and keeping up the pressure to get them implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The role played by research and development and education is key for innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Promoting R&D investment includes a better use of public procurement, more innovation-friendly regulation and stepping up the provision of targeted fiscal incentives to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Finland is currently the only country in the euro area which complies with the Lisbon target of 3% spending on R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Adequate systems to support R&D are of course not only a quantitative issue; increasing the efficiency of research at the same time is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">A highly educated labour force fosters prospects for innovation and facilitates the adoption of new technologies from abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In my view, a healthy economic environment consists of well-functioning product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This means an environment where competitive forces will reduce price margins, and therefore entrepreneurs have a strong incentive to allocate their resources in the most efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">An additional channel through which competition has an impact on labour productivity is via enhanced innovation, for when competitive pressures are strong there are more incentives to innovate so as to gain an advantage over rivals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Numerous economic studies have documented the positive link between competition and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Against this background, it can be said that the removal of barriers to competition should be a policy priority of the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Some steps have been taken and their fruits are already visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">For example, the recent reforms implemented in the telecommunications sector show up in their high levels of labour productivity growth  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It is also reassuring to know that most euro area countries have passed competition laws which are comparable in depth with the best legal frameworks available to other major OECD countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">With the exception of agricultural products, these countries score equally well in reducing trade restrictions and in not imposing excessive restrictions on foreign direct investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">However, more remains to be done as regards the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Increasing competition, of course, also means that innovation needs appropriate protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.96,0)">Incentives to invest in innovation would completely vanish if rewards were to be fully shared with competitors due to spillover effects and if the rights associated with the investment were left unprotected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Laws to protect property rights and the strict international enforcement of these laws remain indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">A competitive and well-developed financial system is also a key to enhancing growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">A modern financial system boosts economic efficiency by channelling resources to the most profitable activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">A process of European financial integration is gradually taking place and considerable progress has been made, for instance, in capital markets and wholesale banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.01,0)">However, the retail banking sector does not appear to have reached its potential yet, and competition seems insufficient in this area; it leaves European consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises unable to take full advantage of the benefits of EMU and the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.24,0)">Inflexible labour markets have also been blamed for the labour productivity slowdown in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.69,0)">Labour market rigidities discourage the effective reallocation of labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For example, it has been argued that American workers tend to invest more in general human capital, while European workers favour specific human capital investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.92,0)">This may be partly linked to the fact that workers in the US have little unemployment protection and low unemployment benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.33,0)">On this score, employment protection legislation may have a particularly strong negative impact on industries subject to rapid technological change since it may preclude efficient matching of workers to jobs in view of new job requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.52,0)">Unfortunately, progress in increasing contractual flexibility, in particular for permanent workers, has been disappointingly slow in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Labour market flexibility is not an issue of productivity growth only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Flexible labour markets in terms of wage and employment adjustment benefit both firms and workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Contractual flexibility is essential in a world of technological change and globalisation – about which I will talk more in a minute – where workers can no longer count on job security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It enhances the opportunity to get into a new position and leads to higher employment security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Education and training systems need to help workers master transitions between jobs and keep up with technological developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.64,0)">Flexible labour markets and efficient activation measures contribute to shorter periods of unemployment, which could otherwise lead to a decline in worker’s skills and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">3.2 Globalisation and productivity growth Let me now turn to the link between globalisation and productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In essence, globalisation means the increased international economic interdependence and the rapid integration of several emerging economies into global trade and production networks that we have experienced in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">However, it also includes the growing internationalisation of financial markets and capital movements, a phenomenon which has intensified since the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Globalisation brings clear benefits to the economy, but at the same time poses significant challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Let’s look at the benefits: first, trade liberalisation and globalisation enables an economy to obtain the cheapest products on the world market, and may, in turn, exert downward pressure on domestic prices through lower import prices, thereby increasing the real wealth of the importing economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Globalisation implies welfare gains by having a dampening effect on consumer prices, while allowing producers to substitute cheaper intermediate goods, thereby increasing profit margins or improving their price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Second, globalisation has certainly helped to stimulate competition in domestic markets and to increase and diversify euro area trade linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.58,0)">In 1995, two-thirds of extra-euro area manufacturing imports came from industrialised, high-cost countries, whereas in 2005 their share had declined to around 50%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.89,0)">The decrease is distributed among the traditional major euro area trade partners  , while the shift towards emerging, low-cost economies is mainly accounted for by increased imports from China and, to a lesser extent, the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Third, and most importantly in the context of my presentation today, globalisation impacts on productivity through trade, capital mobility and the internationalisation of technology and R&D, which can lead to a reallocation of production processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Trade increases incentives to specialise in higher- productivity sectors, produce economies of scale and encourages innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Inward and outward foreign direct investment implies opportunities to learn and adopt technologies and productivity-enhancing practices from abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">At the same time, the internationalisation of R&D supports domestic innovation and technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Immigration may also help to increase the matching efficiency of labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, it is also true that globalisation presents challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In order to reap its potential gains, globalisation requires economies to adjust to the reallocation of production and the new competition from emerging markets in certain sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.27,0)">The tremendously increased supply of products from emerging markets may induce a reorganisation of production in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This strengthens the need for occupational mobility and the capacity to also absorb low-skilled labour in new sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.87,0)">The restructuring of the economy may lead to an at least temporary decrease in productivity, which would be more protracted the ‘stickier’ the economy and less able to overhaul traditional production structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.92,0)">This may imply that those countries where the pace of reforms has been slow may find themselves, paradoxically, in a worse position than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.64,0)">Economies with uncompetitive product markets and rigid labour markets not only fail to adjust to technological change, but are also more vulnerable to shocks associated with the globalisation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Concluding remarks I would like to conclude by saying that Europe is reforming its economy so as to adapt to the challenges of globalisation, technological change and ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Considerable progress has been achieved, as reflected in the significant rise in employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Now the challenge is to also raise the level of productivity growth in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">If this challenge is not met, it is hard to imagine that Europe will be able to achieve a higher growth path and to keep the wealth of its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Monetary Union has been effective – and very successful – in supporting growth through a credible monetary policy which creates a stable macroeconomic environment and has lowered financing costs for a number of euro area countries through a reduction of risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">EMU, moreover, gives impetus to European integration, particularly in financial markets, and to a further reduction of the barriers to competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The Lisbon process now provides the tools to address the challenge of fully reversing the previous slowdown through further structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">It will require the firm commitment of governments, entrepreneurs and workers to be successful and meet this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I am still highly optimistic that we will succeed.</span><span

TFP and ICT capital growth does not suffice to confirm the existence of spillover effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Other factors apart from possible spillovers could also explain a possible correlation between ICT capital growth and changes in TFP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.36,0)">These other factors are: i) mismeasured production inputs, ii)
