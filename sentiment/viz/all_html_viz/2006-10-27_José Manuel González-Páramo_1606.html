    <h1> Europe's Monetary Union in practice </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, 14th Osaka City University (OCU) International Academic Symposium, Osaka, 27 October 2006 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: José Manuel González-Páramo </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)"> Europe’s Monetary Union in practice Keynote speech by José Manuel González-Páramo,Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,14th Osaka City University   International Academic Symposium, Osaka, 27 October 2006 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Osaka.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I would like to thank Osaka City University and the European Commission for organising this international symposium, and for giving me the opportunity to address such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">In a speech given in October 1997, the then President of the European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, who later became the first President of the European Central Bank  , forecasted that Economic and Monetary Union   would “contribute to the creation of a large zone of monetary stability in Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">He continued “the euro, in particular, will be a strong and stable currency that will foster further economic and financial integration among member countries, thereby completing the internal market”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The expectation that EMU would promote economic stability and foster financial integration in Europe was indeed forefront in the minds of those who drafted and signed the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">But has EMU fulfilled these expectations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is the question I would like to answer in my intervention today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This kind of stocktaking exercise could help us not only to emphasise the achievements obtained so far, but also to identify the challenges that remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Let me also emphasise the fact that, although Europe’s experience is a unique one and cannot offer a standard solution to other regions on their road towards integration, I am convinced that an evaluation of this experience can also provide valuable lessons to other regional initiatives and, in particular, to the Asian economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Assessing price stability I shall begin by assessing what can be considered the most natural goal of any monetary union: the adoption of a credible monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In this context, credibility should be understood as the confidence that economic agents have in the central bank to react to the various shocks affecting the economy in such a way as to be able to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">How can this credibility among private agents be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">First, by being clearly committed to a well-defined goal and by pursuing it consistently and independently of political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Accordingly, the first two features of our monetary policy strategy in the euro area are the fact that the ECB and the national central banks   of the Eurosystem are fully independent, and the fact that a quantitative definition of the ECB’s primary objective – price stability – has been clearly specified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This quantitative definition   provides clear guidance for inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At the same time, it serves the purpose of accountability, since it sets a benchmark against which the ECB’s performance can be assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As just noted, the ECB’s definition of price stability refers to a medium-term horizon, in recognition of the fact that monetary policy can control price developments only in the medium to longer term and never over immediate horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.43,0)">There are many reasons for this decision, some of them related to the presence of uncertainty in the economy and the need to anchor expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.67,0)">The length of the lags with which monetary policy affects price developments is variable and uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.82,0)">Moreover, the optimum monetary policy response always depends on the specific types of shock affecting the economy, as well as on their magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">A medium-term horizon allows central bankers the necessary flexibility to respond appropriately to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Furthermore, a medium-term perspective helps to avoid introducing unnecessary volatility into the economy and to stabilise output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The medium-term orientation is also important from the point of view of our credibility and thus helps to anchor inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The medium-term horizon implies accepting and communicating to the public that monetary policy cannot offset short-term changes in the inflation rate caused by economic shocks, such as sharp oil price increases or higher administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It therefore also implies that short-term deviations of inflation from the definition of price stability are acceptable and do not call into question the determination and ability of the ECB to deliver price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In order to best serve its primary objective of medium-term price stability, the ECB has chosen a full-information approach which rests on two pillars: economic analysis and monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This two-pillar approach therefore produces complementary pictures which can be cross-checked against each other and which together provide a comprehensive assessment of the current risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Furthermore, there is one feature of our monetary policy that plays a particularly crucial role in maintaining credibility and thus anchoring inflation expectations: communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.42,0)">A central bank which does not succeed in communicating the principles underlying its monetary policy and which is perceived as acting in a non-systematic, discretionary manner will, over time, endanger its reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">A central bank’s communication should therefore ensure that markets understand both the systematic responses of monetary policy to economic developments and the current assessment of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Successful central bank communication supports predictability and correct price formation in financial markets, contributes to the efficient allocation of funds and reduces uncertainty about future interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">A reasonable understanding of the monetary policy strategy among the public helps to guide price and wage-setting behaviour in a manner consistent with the objectives of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, it was understood at an early stage that external communication would be very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In this respect, the publication of the key elements of the monetary policy strategy in October 1998 and the communication of the details of its clarification in 2003 constituted in themselves a major step towards monetary policy transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the practical implementation of our communication we make use of a wide range of channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will mention only two of these here: First, we hold a press conference after the first Governing Council meeting in each month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The introductory statement at this press conference is a key element of our communication, as it conveys the collective view of the ECB’s Governing Council on the monetary policy stance in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.7,0)">Second, there is the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, which is published one week after the press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It gives a more detailed explanation of the analysis behind the monetary policy decisions, as well as regularly reporting on information collected by the ECB, such as the bank lending survey or the Survey of Professional Forecasters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">Importantly, it also includes the quarterly projections, an advance copy of which is published immediately after the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The Monthly Bulletin also contains articles providing insights into the principles governing our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is this combination of a full and transparent presentation of the monetary policy concept and strategy, a precise arithmetic definition of price stability, and detailed explanations of the ECB’s assessment every month which allows market participants not only to have an intimate understanding of our policy and the way it is implemented, but also, more importantly, to correctly predict our decisions on the basis of all pertinent information and data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The question therefore is whether the monetary policy strategy adopted since the introduction of the euro has proven to be effective in the pursuit of this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Looking back on the period since 1999, the answer must be a clear “yes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.02,0)">It is true that occasionally the inflation rate has moved above the 2% ceiling as a result of temporary shocks, for example the recent sharp rise in oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the presence of such shocks, however, what it is important from the monetary policy perspective is that price stability was maintained over the medium term, in other words, once the shock had disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.71,0)">Another key indicator of the ECB’s monetary policy comes from expectations of inflation, which can be calculated, for example, by the differences between the returns on index-linked and nominal bonds and inflation-linked swap rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.04,0)">When looking at these market prices, however, one has to bear in mind that the spread between these nominal and real yields not only measures market participants’ inflation expectations, but also includes the inflation uncertainty risk premium required by investors as compensation for the risk of a loss in purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Keeping this in mind, and also looking at various measures of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, such as Consensus Forecasts and the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, one can say that long-term inflation expectations have been pretty well anchored by the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Moreover, the success of the ECB’s monetary policy can also be judged through its degree of predictability, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">to what extent policy moves have been well anticipated by money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Recent studies by academics have confirmed that the ECB’s level of predictability is the highest of all major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Investors have indeed become more confident in their forecasts of future short-term interest rate developments prior to the ECB’s monetary policy announcements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Bond market indicators paint essentially the same picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.24,0)">Implied bond market volatility in the euro area is currently close to its lowest level since January 1999  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Looking more closely at the results provided by the literature, it can be seen that, between 1 January 1999 and 12 December 2005, out of a total of 120 days on which Governing Council meetings were held, financial markets were surprised on only eight occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.13,0)">The greatest surprise was registered on 17 September 2001, when the ECB lowered interest rates at an unscheduled meeting as a response to the exceptional events of 9/11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.5,0)">The surprises are split more or less evenly between days when the policy rate was changed and days when it was not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.43,0)">All surprises on days when no changes were made to policy rates were followed by a change in policy rates a month later, suggesting that these surprises were related to the precise timing of the decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.41,0)">It is also likely that some of the surprises were related to the size of the change in policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.66,0)">This is particularly true for surprises occurring within longer periods of gradual policy-tightening or loosening  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Finally, the largest surprises occurred during the first three years of EMU, indicating that the ECB’s short-term predictability has increased over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This account of events may reflect the fact that financial markets have gradually learned about the ECB’s monetary policy framework and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Evidence also suggests that the volatility of long-term bond futures prices increases around the time that the ECB makes its monetary policy announcements and holds its press conferences, suggesting that both of these events contain information that is relevant to bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.85,0)">However, the increase in volatility is relatively muted and short-lived, which is consistent with the interpretation that the ECB’s decisions and communication have, on the whole, been predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">All in all, if we consider that the ECB started without a credibility record of its own, the true magnitude of this success becomes apparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The ECB’s independence, its clearly defined mandate and its transparency in carrying out this mandate should be considered crucial underpinnings of this achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Assessing financial integration Let me now turn to the theme of financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">As mentioned in my introductory remarks, another important expected outcome of EMU was an acceleration in the process of European financial market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The significance of this outcome should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Both economic theory and empirical findings suggest that the integration and development of financial markets contribute to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">In particular, from the Eurosystem’s perspective, we generally distinguish four main benefits arising from financial integration  : First, financial integration is of key importance for the conduct of the single monetary policy, as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Second, financial integration is highly relevant to the Eurosystem’s task of contributing to safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Third, financial integration is fundamental both to the Eurosystem’s task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and to its strong interest in the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Finally, it is generally accepted that financial integration fosters financial development and the modernisation of the financial system and, ultimately, contributes to increasing the potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Many factors have contributed recently to enhancing financial integration in Europe, including public action at the Community level aimed at removing residual legislative and regulatory obstacles as well as allowing competitive forces to deploy their effects in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has also played a crucial role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In particular, the elimination of exchange rate risk and the removal of barriers to cross-border trading have opened up the various markets in the euro area to many more investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In addition to the introduction of the euro, the ECB and the Eurosystem have played an important role in fostering European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB has defined four kinds of activity with which the ECB and the Eurosystem contribute to this process: First, we try to enhance knowledge and raise awareness of the state of and need for European financial integration, and we measure the progress made – the most obvious example in this respect is the launch of our regular monitoring on the basis of quantitative indicators of financial integration in the euro area, and the numerous research activities that are being pursued by Eurosystem staff, together with academics, for example via the joint network of the ECB and the Centre for Financial Studies at Frankfurt University on “Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe”, and in cooperation with market practitioners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Second, we act as a catalyst for private sector activities by facilitating collective action and assisting with possible coordination problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As a very recent example of this, I would like to highlight the Short-Term European Paper – or STEP – initiative, led by ACI, the Financial Markets Association and the European Banking Federation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The purpose of this initiative is to promote the further integration of the European short-term securities market via the convergence of standards and practices through market participants’ compliance with the STEP Market Convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The Eurosystem has supported this initiative since its inception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It provided technical support for the labelling process for the first two years, and the ECB produces statistics on yields and volumes in the STEP market, which it publishes on its website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">These statistics are expected to play an important role in fostering the integration of the European short-term securities markets through greater market transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A further example is the area of retail payments, where the degree of integration is relatively low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The banking industry has, however, launched an initiative to create a Single Euro Payments Area  , which will enable European citizens, enterprises and public authorities to make payments throughout the euro area from a single bank account, and using a single set of payment instruments, as easily and safely as in the national context today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In addition, national infrastructures will be migrated to a pan-European payments infrastructure characterised by complete interoperability between SEPA-compliant infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Sizeable financial benefits are expected from the integration of retail payments, as a result of standardisation and the opening-up of payment services markets to more competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">The Eurosystem supports this initiative and acts as a catalyst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">High-level coordination takes place between the Eurosystem and the banking industry, and the ECB has arranged a number of meetings involving SEPA end-users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">An additional example of the catalyst role in the field of standard market legal documentation is the Master Agreement for Financial Transactions  ).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The EMA is the first pan-European market standard for trading operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It contributes to financial integration by permitting cross-border trading on the basis of a master agreement which is both a domestic and a pan-European standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The EMA, which is a multilingual, multi-jurisdictional and multi-product master agreement, may be used to document repurchase agreements, foreign exchange, derivatives and securities loans, and generally serves to maximise cross-product netting and margining possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB participated in the drafting of the EMA and uses it for its relevant operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, we provide central banking services that also foster European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In this respect, let me mention the most prominent example: our operation of the real-time gross settlement payment system for the euro, the TARGET system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This system, which has been operational since the very first day of EMU, has supported the rapid integration of the euro money market, which is a sine qua non for monetary policy implementation, since only an integrated interbank market can ensure an even distribution of central bank liquidity and a homogeneous level of short-term interest rates across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The launch of the single shared platform, TARGET2, which is scheduled for November 2007, will further enhance financial integration, as it will provide a harmonised level of service and a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In July 2006 the ECB announced that the Eurosystem was evaluating opportunities to provide settlement services for securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This proposal is called TARGET2-Securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">If it materialises, it will bring about significant improvements to the way in which securities settlement in euro occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">TARGET is the biggest payment system in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">TARGET2 is its second version – more efficient, less costly and more user-friendly – which is set to be launched in about one year from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Following on from this, TARGET2-Securities is a project which would make use of   the TARGET2 platform to settle the cash legs of securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Another example is the Eurosystem’s decision to gradually introduce a single list in its collateral framework for monetary policy operations as from January 2007 with the aim of replacing the current two-tier system of eligible collateral  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The single list should enhance the level playing-field in the euro area, further promote equal treatment for counterparties and issuers, and increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework for monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The decision in favour of the single list in the collateral framework therefore also underlines the Eurosystem’s determination to foster financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A further example of this kind of activity is the correspondent central banking model  , which exists for the cross-border transfer of collateral to the Eurosystem in addition to transfers via links between securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.46,0)">Initially, the CCBM was created as an interim model that would cease to operate as soon as the market had developed comprehensive and reliable alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Today, however, it remains the main instrument for mobilising cross-border collateral in the context of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Fourth, we provide advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Although financial integration is primarily a market-driven process, an essential task that falls exclusively to public authorities is the setting-up of an effective legislative and regulatory framework that paves the way for further financial integration by establishing basic common rules and removing obstacles to cross-border transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Eurosystem regularly contributes in numerous areas related to EU financial services policy and financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In particular, it contributed to the European Commission’s public consultation regarding the priorities for financial services policies over the next five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In that contribution, the Eurosystem expressed its broad support for the Commission’s general policy orientation, such as the need to pursue supervisory convergence and the need for consolidation and consistent implementation of the existing legislative framework for financial services, which should be achieved by exploiting the potential of the existing institutional set-up, such as the Lamfalussy comitology framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The consultation on this Green Paper led the European Commission to publish, in December 2005, its “White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this document, there was a particular focus on the areas of clearing and settlement, retail banking   and investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Eurosystem also provided contributions to the Green Papers on the last two issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Furthermore, Article 105  of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that the ECB is to be consulted, in its fields of competence, on any proposed Community act and on any draft legislative provision proposed by national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Against this background, what is the status of financial integration in Europe today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The broad finding   is that the euro has generally acted as a major catalyst for the integration of all the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The degree of integration differs, however, between market segments and integration is more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, above all the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me mention some specific results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The unsecured euro interbank deposit market was almost perfectly integrated right at the start of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.3,0)">The cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries was as low as 3 basis points in early 1999 and has since decreased to just 1 basis point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.64,0)">Moreover, since the launch of the EUREPO index in 2002, the euro area cross-country standard deviation of the one-month EUREPO rates has generally been below 1 basis point and that for the twelve-month maturity below 2 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The decisive role of the euro in enhancing financial market integration is also visible in the government bond markets, which shows a very high degree of integration, mainly due to the disappearance of intra-euro area exchange rate risk and the convergence of inflation expectations across countries by the time the euro was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Since then, government bond yields have been driven mainly by euro area-wide factors – despite the fact that remaining differences between countries may also still be explained by differences in liquidity as well as in the availability of developed derivates markets tied to the various individual bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Additionally, bond yields in different countries also reflect differences in perceived credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Our indicators for the state of integration of the euro corporate bond market are based on econometric models and suggest that this market segment is fairly integrated in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">With regard to the euro area equity market, our indicators reflect a rising degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">First, since the end of 2000, the advantages of sectoral diversification seem to have surpassed those of geographical diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Recent data suggest increased correlations of both country and sector returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, equity returns in the euro area countries are increasingly determined by common factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Third, quantitative indicators point to the fact that euro area investors have diversified their equity portfolio holdings within the euro area as a consequence of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Finally, as regards banking markets, the indicators reveal that the euro area retail banking markets continue to be fragmented, whereas euro area interbank   market and capital market-related activities show solid signs of increasing integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The finding that the degree of integration in retail banking markets is low is also supported by the comparatively low cross-border presence of euro area banks in other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.47,0)">Furthermore, the cross-country dispersion of the same types of interest rates for retail banking products remains high among euro area countries and the respective cross-border banking activity is generally low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In contrast, quantity-based indicators for wholesale and capital market-related securities transactions indicate a rising share of cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Corporate banking indicators suggest that this market segment is also fairly integrated, although further progress could still be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.3,0)">Finally, with regard to banking market infrastructures, the situation for retail payment infrastructures is still characterised by a high level of fragmentation, which supports the general picture that the integration of retail banking markets remains limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude with an overall assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Judging from the experience to date, the euro has been an unquestionable success – euro area price stability being the best exponent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The ECB’s clearly defined mandate, its independence and its full accountability are key ingredients of this success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">However, this does not mean that there is room for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Continued alertness is key to preserving credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.29,0)">Moreover, the performance of the euro area economy in recent years has also shown that price stability itself is not sufficient to achieve sustained growth: it is just a prerequisite, a necessary condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Appropriate structural reforms and sound public finances are some of the most relevant aspects that are also needed to achieve sustainable non-inflationary growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As far as financial integration is concerned, significant progress has been made in Europe over the past few years, fostered in particular by the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.3,0)">However, financial integration is still lagging behind in the area of retail financial services – both retail banking activities and infrastructure services for payment systems – and in the area of euro area securities clearing and settlement infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">While financial integration is primarily a market-driven process, it also requires an effective interplay between market forces and the actions of the public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Examples such as the STEP and SEPA initiatives show that the private sector can contribute substantially to the integration of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem welcome such market-led initiatives and will continue to support them by acting as a catalyst.</span>
