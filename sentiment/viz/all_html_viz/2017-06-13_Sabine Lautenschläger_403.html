    <span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)"> Supervising banks - Four priorities Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the International Monetary Conference, London, 13 June 2017 Many thanks for your question, Howard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">So what priorities do I see at the moment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.16,0)">In respect of banking supervision there are four things that come to mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Most importantly, regulation has to remain a global issue; the banking system is global in scope and we need to take a global approach to regulating it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Reforms of banking regulation have now been under way for almost a decade; it is time to finalise them, implement them and see how they work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.18,0)">But it is not only about the rules themselves; it is also about their application.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.29,0)">Supervisors around the world apply the rules very differently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Globally we should focus on how supervision is carried out and how we can learn from each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">What approaches are used?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What are the best tools and methods?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What are the best structures in terms of budget and independence, for instance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These are things we should discuss at global level – also with respect to Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That, in fact, is the second thing on my list of priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We all know that, in the event of a “hard” Brexit, UK banks would have to seek a licence in the EU to do business on the Continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.22,0)">And here, I get the feeling that many banks are a bit too relaxed about this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.18,0)">So my message today to the banks is quite simple: the clock is ticking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Obtaining a licence takes some time, so don’t put off applying for one for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.06,0)">But it is not just about banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the wake of Brexit, we might also see entities, such as broker-dealers or third-country branches, setting up shop in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These entities would probably be supervised at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.87,0)">The market would become more fragmented and all the conditions for a race to the bottom would be present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It might thus be appropriate to have such entities supervised at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The current review of the European rulebook offers a chance to adapt the relevant rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.6,0)">Non-performing loans, or NPLs, are the third item on my list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.75,0)">In some parts of the euro area, banks still have large exposures to NPLs on their balance sheets – a legacy of the economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.88,0)">NPLs are a drag on banks’ profits and they keep the banks from lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.45,0)">The issue needs to be resolved, but it cannot be resolved overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Getting rid of NPLs takes time and effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In March we published guidance for banks on how to deal with NPLs, and our supervisors are monitoring closely the strategies banks devise and the progress they make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Still, resolving NPLs as quickly as possible requires the right structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And here, governments could help by improving the legal and judicial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The price of NPLs depends largely on whether these systems are effective and efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">The fourth item on my list is risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And in a broad sense that also covers internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">After all, banks use these models to calculate risk weights for their assets, which then serve as the starting point for determining the right amount of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I think that risk sensitivity should be central to calculating capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.06,0)">But I also see that internal models have become very complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.8,0)">And that makes them prone to error or even manipulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Against that backdrop, we have launched a major project; the targeted review of internal models, or TRIM, as we call it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">With TRIM, we want to achieve two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, we want to harmonise the supervisory treatment of internal models and ensure a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Second, we want to ensure that the results of internal models are conservative and driven by actual risks, and not by modelling choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This will strengthen trust in the banks’ calculation of risk and, ultimately, in the adequacy of capital buffers.</span>
