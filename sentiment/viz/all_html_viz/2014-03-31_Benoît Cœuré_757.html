    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> The known unknowns of central clearing Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the meeting on global economy and financial system hosted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business Initiative on Global Markets,Coral Gables, 29 March 2014 Ladies and gentlemen  , Today, I want to share some thoughts with you on central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">At the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009, G20 leaders committed to have all standardised OTC derivatives contracts cleared through central counterparties  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The mandatory use of central clearing as a regulatory tool for mitigating systemic risk is a fairly new feature in financial market regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Central clearing definitely has the capacity to promote financial stability, provided it is appropriately used and any potential side effects are well understood and effectively mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In that context, there are still a number of questions that we need to look at.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.0,0)">Let me call them the “known unknowns” of central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I want to touch upon the following issues: Systemic effects of mandatory clearing Recovery versus resolution of central counterparties Optimal design of loss allocation tools Evolution of global clearing structures Systemic effects of mandatory clearing   Let me start with the systemic effects of mandatory central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Clearing houses have done their job very well in the crisis, contrary to other financial institutions, and successfully faced the challenges of a rapidly growing volume of transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We want to make sure that the same holds true in the new world of mandatory clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The systemic effects of central clearing are numerous and, although the overall balance is undoubtedly positive, some of them are ambiguous and should be addressed carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">On the one hand, mandatory clearing reduces systemic risk very significantly as it leads to the collateralisation of trades that might have remained uncollateralised otherwise, enhances risk management by means of sophisticated margining methods, allows for mutualisation of risk, which promotes the resilience of the financial system, especially in the event of catastrophic scenarios, offers multilateral netting so that less collateral is needed to manage risks, and facilitates risk management as it helps to overcome information asymmetries that participants in non-centrally cleared markets face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.08,0)">On the other hand, some consequences of central clearing may increase systemic risk: as a result of growing risk concentration in CCPs and in a limited number of large global dealers, which act as general clearing members as a gateway for other financial institutions to CCPs, as a consequence of mutualisation, risks may spread among participants and markets more widely and the distribution of losses is more difficult to predict, in order to avoid mandatory clearing, we might see migration of risk outside of the regulated universe through the artificial creation of bespoke   products that are not suitable for central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.98,0)">Moreover, the systemic effect of clearing depends on whether risk is redistributed to those who are more able to deal with it, which is difficult to determine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.45,0)">Finally, the overall systemic effect depends on the incentives for risk-taking and central clearing that accompany risk redistribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">To promote central clearing and avoid regulatory arbitrage, a number of reforms have been adopted including:   mandatory clearing,   margin requirements for non-centrally cleared trades, and   higher capital requirements for non-centrally cleared trades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This highlights the crucial complementarity between the regulation of banks and the regulation of financial market infrastructures  , with the overall objective that regulation reduces overall risk, and does not shift it around the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Cooperation between the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions   on the one hand, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision   on the other hand, is key in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">A macroeconomic impact assessment led by the BIS focused on the effects of these reforms and found net benefits of 0.12% of GDP per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These are estimates of the long-run consequences of the reforms and are expected to apply once those reforms have been fully implemented and produced their full economic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, central clearing also involves risk redistribution and potentially the creation of new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The overall impact is therefore less certain: there are significant benefits which need to be balanced against potential new risks and uncertain risk redistribution effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Ultimately, it seems to me that the success of central clearing as a tool for promoting financial stability critically depends on two factors:   the ability of CCPs to handle the risks they are concentrating and thus the design of their corporate governance, risk management and recovery frameworks and   the ability of the official sector to address effectively any unintended side effects and “new” risks that may result from the push towards more central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Recovery versus resolution of CCPs   A second issue that I should like to highlight today concerns the relationship between recovery and resolution of CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">As central clearing involves risk concentration in what we may see as “super systemically relevant” institutions, it is crucial that such institutions can recover from severe shocks or be resolved if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.75,0)">Now there are several questions that are typically raised in this context: At what point in time does a CCP need to be resolved because it cannot recover?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.19,0)">Given that CCPs provide critical services and are required to cover any losses or liquidity shortfalls that may arise, is resolution of a CCP a realistic concept at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Is it ever needed or appropriate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">What makes CCPs different from other financial institutions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.11,0)">Do these differences require different rules for their recovery and resolution?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.48,0)">The CPSS-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures   require CCPs to have a plan for allocating any losses and liquidity shortfalls that the regular “waterfall” – that is, a sequence of prefunded financial resources – does not cover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.92,0)">Alternatively, the respective CCP might have to be resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The CPSS-IOSCO and the Financial Stability Board   will provide guidance on the recovery and resolution of CCPs by mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.16,0)">The question is: should resolution only be performed if and when recovery has failed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">Or could there be circumstances in which the resolution of a CCP is preferable to its recovery, even if recovery was still feasible?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me first explore some features that make financial market infrastructures different from other financial institutions: Service continuation   is more important in the case of FMIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They are utilities at the heart of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Their smooth operation is essential for all other types of financial service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.2,0)">In most cases, there are only a few, if any, substitutes or alternative providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">Unlike banks, FMIs have ex ante loss allocation rules that they can draw on for the purpose of recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">Not all FMIs are exposed to credit risk  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.13,0)">The size and composition of their balance sheets   is different, which makes bail-in as a recovery or resolution tool difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To the extent that the use of a CCP is mandatory, it is absolutely essential that the relevant clearing services are preserved regardless of the circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">In conclusion, the recovery of CCPs in order to maintain service continuation is much more important for CCPs than for other financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That’s why the PFMIs require CCPs to be able to allocate any losses that are not already covered by regular risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">So if the recovery of CCPs is so vital, is there any scope for resolution at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.4,0)">I think there is, for a number of reasons: First of all, the attempt to recover may simply fail: the ex-ante recovery plans may prove inadequate ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Recovery plans have fortunately not yet been tested, and it remains to be seen how they work in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Most importantly, however, recovery is not an end in itself, but a means to preserve financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.41,0)">Entry into resolution should be possible if the recovery plan has failed to return the FMI to viability or if its implementation would otherwise compromise financial stability, for example if the application of a particular loss allocation tool turns out to overexpose certain   participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.52,0)">Moreover, resolution may also become necessary if participants do not want to use the CCP any longer and prefer to wind it down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In conclusion, the resolution authorities have the responsibility   to do what is systemically needed in a crisis situation, which may mean in extreme cases that the application of resolution procedures is preferable to the activation of a recovery plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Of course, much will depend on authorities doing the right thing at the time of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This in turn assumes that authorities have enough information at any point in time to "connect the dots" of a complex network of CCPs and global dealers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Hence the critical importance of enforcing the new reporting requirements to trade repositories  , and further to this, of being able to aggregate data collected by TRs across products, institutions, and jurisdictions, and conduct analytical work based on this data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">Optimal design of loss allocation tools   Let me now turn to the third known unknown, which is the subject of much debate: what is the optimal design and composition of a CCP’s recovery tools?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In the field of recovery, we are entering new territory, which is why the authorities have wisely taken a very cautious approach to giving guidance to FMIs on the design of their recovery plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Ideally, recovery tools should be comprehensive, effective and controllable; they should create appropriate incentives for risk management and minimise any negative impacts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.18,0)">However, the challenge is that no individual tool can equally meet all of these criteria because of trade-offs, for example: Uncapped cash calls are comprehensive, but may create disincentives for central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Variation margin haircutting can be comprehensive and effective  , but the loss allocation and hence the systemic effect is uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Initial margin haircutting may help achieve comprehensiveness, but increases the potential for contagion risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.63,0)">The optimal choice of recovery tools is still evolving and remains a controversial issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The regulatory approach by CPSS-IOSCO is therefore non-prescriptive and aims to provide guidance that should help FMIs to choose the appropriate   recovery tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This approach, however, might need to be adapted over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Evolution of global clearing structures   Let me now turn to the fourth known unknown, which is the optimal design of the global clearing structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Such a design depends on numerous factors and questions: How many CCPs do we need at global level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How many markets should a CCP serve?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.22,0)">What are the implications of competitive clearing where there are several CCPs serving the same trading venue?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.86,0)">Should CCPs be linked and how?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Should links be limited to cash-market CCPs or also apply to derivatives and commodities CCPs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">What degree of tiering is optimal and how should participants get access to CCPs when needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This question has gained in importance with the establishment of the clearing obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">What we see today is a globalisation process that has triggered a trend towards global clearing with increasingly large global CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Moreover, it appears that many banks prefer indirect access to clearing services so as to comply with the clearing obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Client clearing seems thus to be dominated by a few large global intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.61,0)">This concentration creates a higher degree of dependency on this small group of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The trend towards the globalisation of clearing has benefits and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">On the one hand, there is greater scope for netting that allows for collateral savings, the lower cost of direct access and using CCPs, and an increase in transparency for both regulators and CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.05,0)">On the other hand, there is a potential for systemic risks as CCPs may become too big to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.83,0)">Also, market power may push up clearing fees and restrict entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.03,0)">This could create disincentives for central clearing and could undermine the efficiency gains reaped in the first place by eroding the pricing power of global dealers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.19,0)">There could also be cross-border regulatory frictions in the case of multiple   national regulations, and last but not least the cross-border liquidity provision in several currencies becomes more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This leads me to the last and maybe most challenging “unknown”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Given CCPs' role as financial market utilities that has been reinforced by mandatory clearing requirements, and their increasing systemic relevance, would the world be a safer place, if CCPs had been established as non-for-profit institutions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">My tentative answer is no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">I have outlined the importance of good risk management in CCPs, and the ability to adapt to a changing market environment in terms of counterparties, products, and technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">I am convinced that this will be better done in a market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">But this certainly requires strong supervision, effective cooperative oversight arrangements, and setting up the right incentive structure so that CCPs don’t lose sight of public interest, starting with the interest of their indirect members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Central clearing will make the global financial system safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, it also has the potential to redistribute risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Its overall systemic effect will thus depend on the incentives for risk-taking and central clearing that accompany risk redistribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Hence the need for the official sector to provide the right incentive framework ex-ante, produce data that can help understand the distribution of risk, and tightly supervise CCPs in a spirit of cooperation across jurisdictions.</span>
