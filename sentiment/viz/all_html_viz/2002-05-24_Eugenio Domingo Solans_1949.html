    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> Monetary integration in Europe: some past and present experiences Speech by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Madrid Seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American Central Banks, Madrid, 24 May 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It is my pleasure to address you as keynote speaker this lunchtime during the Seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">"Europe will be built through concrete achievements", wrote Robert Schuman in his Declaration of 9 May 1950, the starting point of the European integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A few years later, another great European, Jacques Rueff, was even more specific: "L'Europe se fera par la monnaie ou ne se fera pas", he prophesied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Half a century later, the success of the euro cash changeover, the most complex logistical operation ever undertaken in times of peace, as it was said, marks the functional culmination of European monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I say "functional culmination of European monetary integration" because geographical culmination is still to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">If, as I hope and expect, we are successful in integrating the pre-in European Union countries and the accession countries, the euro area will become the most important economic region in the world by far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">One conclusion we can draw from the European experience is that full monetary integration is the final result of a long process of previous economic co-operation, harmonisation and co-ordination in many areas including exchange rate co-ordination itself: the customs union, the single market for goods, services and production factors, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In particular, nominal, sustainable and durable macroeconomic convergence is a precondition for monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Allow me to underline the ideas of sustainability and durability when I refer to nominal convergence as a precondition for monetary integration, in accordance with Article 109 J and Article 1 of Protocol No.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">6 of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">When stressing this point, I, of course, have the future accession to the European Union of new central and eastern European countries in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As I mentioned before, some degree of exchange rate co-ordination is also one step that must be taken when building economic integration in order to eventually achieve full monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Past experiences in Europe of the "Snake"   resulting from the Werner Report   and the exchange rate mechanism   of the European Monetary System     are clear examples of appropriate monetary co-ordination made along the road towards achieving greater goals in the process of economic and monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this vein and for the enlargement process it is worth mentioning that one of the nominal Maastricht convergence criteria to be fulfilled in order to join the euro area is the observance of the nominal fluctuation margins provided for by the ERM of the EMS   for a period of at least two years, without devaluation against the currency of any other member state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I have not forgotten that many exchange rate realignments occurred in the ERM, especially in the 90s, when – and partly because – the free circulation of capital became a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Actually, I was one of the four members of the Executive Commission of the Banco de España when the last realignment of the exchange rate of the peseta took place in March 1995.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">The existence of these ERM realignments is a clear evidence of the impossibility of pegging exchange rates without complying with certain economic preconditions, as I said before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Moreover, the ERM realignments, decided in Brussels after complex and demanding procedures in an environment of "peer pressure", were in themselves the confirmation of the existence of a firm commitment to exchange rate stability in the context of the European single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This is certainly a crucial point in any process of regional economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Only by avoiding excessive exchange rate volatility and, of course, competitive devaluations can a common market function smoothly and without major distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">At the same time, ERM realignments were evidence of the capacity of the system to accommodate external shocks via the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The ERM was a good shock absorber and struck a good balance between commitment and flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">It was a key factor for the success of European monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Once full monetary integration is complete, or even before, it is worth considering under which conditions the situation is sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In other words, it is worth discussing the "one-size-fits-all" issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Indeed, this is probably the crucial policy debate in the context of the "optimum currency areas" framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Above, I have touched upon the nominal convergence aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me now concentrate on three aspects of this vast analytical and policy debate, of which the first two are from the common wisdom in this field and the third is a rather personal strong view on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">One size does indeed fit all, provided that three key conditions are fulfilled: the degree of synchronisation of the cycles of the regional economies is high enough; output and production factor markets are flexible enough to absorb asymmetric regional shocks; and the responses of the economic policy are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Allow me to elaborate on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The first condition – synchronisation of the cycles – has to do with two main factors: the sectoral composition of regional economies within monetary union and the degree of economic policy interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">The second condition – flexibility – concerns mainly supply side aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The third condition – appropriate responses of the economic policy – opens a wide range of issues   out of which I will only touch one: the style or approach of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Concerning economic policy interaction, I would like to mention three relevant points based on the European experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">First, the fact that Member States regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern, co-ordinate them within the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines, accept that their economic performances are subject to multilateral surveillance and are prepared to accept recommendations from the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, let me underline the importance of the Stability and Growth Pact as a valid institutional arrangement to avoid too divergent fiscal policy stances in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">If, as is the case in the European Union, the central budget is relatively small, the need for a stability pact in the area of public finances is vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.22,0)">The third point I would like to make is the need to avoid ex ante co-ordination between finance ministers and central bankers so as not to confuse their respective roles, mandates and responsibilities and eventually hamper central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">We, as central bankers, know ex ante, on a statutory basis, what our function is and, therefore, we do not need to sit down to discuss with others if, when or how much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Exchanging information and views between ministers and central bankers is certainly necessary, as is explaining ex post the central bank's reaction function and assessing together the ex post results of economic policy, but not ex ante co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Concerning market flexibility and the absorption of asymmetric shocks, let me stress again the importance of the Stability and Growth Pact as an institutional arrangement able to deal within a certain margin with different regional situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Is the present margin wide enough?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I think it is, considering the intensity of the possible shocks to be absorbed, the current mobility of the production factors and the current flexibility of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Nevertheless, in order to be in a safer position, the case in Europe for a supply side policy or market policy oriented towards more input mobility, more dynamism, more flexibility and more adaptability also seems clear to ensure that "one size fits all".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will now turn to the link between the "one-size-fits-all" issue and the style of monetary policy and more specifically the non-activist approach of the Eurosystem monetary policy – one basic element which characterises it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.38,0)">Monetary policy cannot fine-tune economic activity either in time or in space, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">it cannot fine tune economic cycles or discriminate between regional effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">Although monetary policy could have short-term effects – especially via expectations or via the exchange rate channels – as well as regional effects – due to differences in sectoral composition across regions – from a mere positivist angle it would be unwise to try to exploit them, taking into account the complexity and uncertainty of the developments involved and the limited knowledge we have on the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Monetary policy should have a medium-term orientation aimed at providing monetary stability and, by doing so, it also contributes to creating the best monetary conditions for a balanced economy in macroeconomic terms and also for sustainable economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">These remarks are, in my view, sufficient arguments in favour of a non-activist monetary policy, because not being active in terms of frequency of monetary policy changes means that we avoid missing the right moment to act and not being sensitive to regional differences means that monetary policy can meet the monetary requirements of the area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.54,0)">Not being activist means that we do not, as we bluntly say in Spanish, "dar palos de ciego", lash out wildly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Moreover, not being activist also permits a better degree of interaction with other global or regional economic policies, in line with the idea of the non-ex ante co-ordination I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Not being activist is also the logical outcome of having a flexible monetary policy strategy based on judgement, instead of a mechanical strategy based on rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">When considering the Eurosystem's monetary policy style we should bear in mind that gradualism should not be confused with activism and that non-activism is not incompatible with decisive and firm decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The medium-term orientation of monetary policy and the resulting monetary conditions are intended to be valid for the whole geographical area and are actually suitable for all regions, as is the case with the air conditioning of this room which is supposed to suit everybody.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Fresh air as opposed to air from an oxygen tank: this is my preferred metaphor to compare the non-activist monetary policy of the Eurosystem to an activist approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">There are, of course, other metaphors that we can use to depict the lack of activism of the Eurosystem's monetary policy, as opposed to an activist monetary policy: framework rather than action, chassis and shock absorber rather than engine, quietly watching a TV programme rather than zapping or, more appropriately for lunch time, traditional cooking rather than using a microwave oven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In my opinion, there are always good reasons to advocate a non-activist monetary policy for the reasons I have attempted to explain above, irrespective of the geographical size of the area to be covered and independently of the size of the monetary policy jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Nevertheless, the larger and more diverse the monetary policy area is and the more complex and uncertain the economic developments that occur in it are, the more convenient it is to follow a non-activist monetary policy approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">If so, this could be a point worth mentioning in any policy debate on optimal currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The aim of my speech has been to present some views and to share with you some experiences related to European monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Perhaps you will find some of our European experiences worth considering in terms of Latin American regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.53,0)">Nevertheless, let me say – although maybe I should have said this before – that historical experiences are not "tradable goods", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.0,0)">they cannot easily be exported to nor imported from other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Unfortunately, each economic region must try to find its own way towards economic integration, suffer its own setbacks and enjoy its own successes, as we are experiencing now with the introduction of the euro cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As an exception which would confirm the rule of not transferring experiences, let me conclude by mentioning four ingredients of European monetary integration which I think should exist in any regional monetary process, if it is considered that this should be the final goal of an economic integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, political vision and will; second, patience; third, pragmatism; and, fourth, a core idea able to give direction and consistency to all decisions and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Political vision and will because economic integration and, of course, exchange rate stability, as well as monetary integration, will, above all always be political commitments beyond their technical implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Patience because economic integration does indeed take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">As for pragmatism, let me mention that the sequence often followed by European integration has been: need – function – institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In a process of regional economic integration, the need for monetary integration will appear sooner rather than later; this need will require the development of the function and, in order for it to be performed, an institution will need to be set up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Without prejudice to impressive top-down approaches for economic integration, I strongly recommend this pragmatic bottom-up approach of need – function – institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Finally, in the case of European monetary integration, the core idea – "la idea fuerza" as we would say in Spanish – is stability – price stability – as a pre-condition for sustainable long-term growth on which our institutional, functional and legal framework of monetary integration has been built.</span>
