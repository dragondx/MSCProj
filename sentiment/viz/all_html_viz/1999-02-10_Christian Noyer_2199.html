    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)"> The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy Speech by the Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Christian Noyer at an event organised by the Club des Affaires de la Hesse, Frankfurt am Main 9 February 1999 The introduction of the euro was a very happy event for all involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro is present on all major financial markets around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Currency trading in euro has commenced and for five weeks now shares have been denominated in euro on most European stock exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Although not yet embodied in the physical form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play an important role, both in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The euro is a symbol of the achievements of Europeans in the pursuit of common goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is unprecedented in European history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">After years of intensive preparations and successful efforts towards convergence, the single monetary policy for the entire euro area is being determined by the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB, which comprises the Governors of the 11 national central banks of the participating Member States plus the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB, has assumed this responsibility and is in charge of monetary policy decisions for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Decisions by the Governing Council will be implemented via the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Indeed, the introduction of the euro marks the culmination of much successful preparatory work over a period of many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This has been reflected in the positive way in which financial markets have received the euro in the first five weeks of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.64,0)">Moreover, the enormous technical and logistical challenges posed during the changeover weekend at the start of the year have been surmounted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">Today, I shall deal with the role of monetary policy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">More in particular, I shall describe the main features of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which underlie our single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Against this background, I shall briefly explain recent monetary policy decisions adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB and its assessment of the current economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Finally, I shall summarise how I view the international role of the euro and that of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The role of monetary policy A successful monetary policy must always be forward-looking, acting to contain threats to price stability before they become entrenched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, today I should also like to look to the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Monetary Union is a unique and significant achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This stable environment is the foundation for sustainable economic growth, better employment prospects and improvements in the standard of living throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Price stability is a necessary condition for improved economic performance in all these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I am confident that the single monetary policy will make the greatest possible contribution in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy announced by the Governing Council last year, and which is now guiding monetary policy decisions, was designed with this goal in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.88,0)">Nevertheless, monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe's economic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Appropriate fiscal policies and structural reforms implemented by national governments are vital and much progress is required in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Moreover, continued wage moderation in both the public and private sectors would contribute to reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.07,0)">Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.11,0)">Implementing too lax a monetary policy will not solve this problem, but rather exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment and saving decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility and efficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I appreciate that these structural reforms are not always easy to implement, not least because the benefits they yield occur mainly in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.74,0)">However, they are unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.39,0)">In those euro area countries that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Other euro area countries should and must take note: structural reform throughout the euro area is fundamental to the success of Monetary Union and to improving Europe's economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy The Treaty on European Union assigned the ESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">You may rest assured that the Governing Council of the ECB is totally committed to fulfilling this mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In order to meet this commitment, the Governing Council has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy consisting of three main elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">First, in order to give clear guidance in relation to expectations of future price developments, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Defining price stability also serves the principles of transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It clarifies how the Treaty's mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public clear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Price stability has therefore been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.33,0)">Needless to say, deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - would not be consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The annual rate of inflation in the most recent available data, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The Eurosystem has therefore enjoyed the good fortune to assume monetary sovereignty in the euro area in an environment of price stability, owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence achieved by national central banks during the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This reflects the need for monetary policy to be forward-looking and to have a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.46,0)">It recognises the fact that monetary policy is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To maintain price stability according to this published definition, the Governing Council's strategy relies on two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">First, a prominent role has been assigned to money, in recognition of the monetary origins of inflation over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This prominent role is reflected in the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first reference value has been set at an annual rate of 4½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The reference value for M3 is consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and taking account of the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.15,0)">Monetary policy will not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a "mechanistic" way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed for the signals that they offer with regard to the prospects for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">If the deviation points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempting to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators, including economic forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Recent developments in monetary policy Co-operation among European national central banks has been close for a long time and, among the NCBs of the countries participating in Stage Three, has become increasingly so in recent years and months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December last year is an illustration of this co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This co-ordinated interest rate move was thoroughly discussed by the members of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">De jure, the decision to change interest rates had to be taken by the national central banks, but, de facto, Monetary Union existed in all but name prior to its formal implementation on 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.41,0)">At its first December meeting, the Governing Council made a thorough assessment of the latest monetary data and other economic indicators, noting in particular the decline in business confidence in the euro area arising, in part, from the deteriorating external environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.87,0)">This deterioration in the international economy has its origins, to a large extent, in the Asian and Russian financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Following its appraisal of both pillars of the monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council concluded that key central bank interest rates of 3% would best serve the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">National central banks adjusted their interest rates accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This co-ordinated interest rate move allowed the ECB to announce that the new level of interest rates would prevail "for the foreseeable future".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In other words, in the absence of further disturbances to the economy or the emergence of new and unanticipated threats to price stability, this level of interest rates should be appropriate to fulfil the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This announcement helped to resolve some uncertainty at a time when the practical, technical and logistical tasks necessitated by the changeover weekend were uppermost in our minds and in those of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Following the second Governing Council meeting in December, the President of the ECB was therefore able to announce that the interest rate on the first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem would also be 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.52,0)">Moreover, the interest rates for the deposit and marginal lending facilities - which, in normal circumstances, would constitute the upper and lower bounds for overnight market interest rates - were set at 2% and 4.5% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As a transitional measure to help the financial system adjust to the new institutional environment resulting from the transition to Stage Three, from 4 January until 21 January a narrower band of 2.75% to 3.25% has been set for the rates on the deposit and marginal lending facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">During the first few days of Stage Three we observed a relatively large recourse by credit institutions to these facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.97,0)">This was to be expected, given the relatively narrow spread between the Eurosystem's marginal lending facility and the overnight money market rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.79,0)">Although the narrow corridor is intended to facilitate the transition by market participants to the new regime, over a longer period of time such a measure would hamper the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">At its meeting on 21 January, the Governing Council reviewed the experience with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market since the beginning of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">It noted that the few difficulties encountered by some market participants with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market and, in particular, with the cross-border flow of liquidity, have diminished substantially over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a consequence, overall, the integration of the euro area money market has therefore rapidly reached a satisfactory state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Against this background, there was no need to continue the application of the narrow interest rate corridor beyond the date of 21 January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Assessment of the current economic situation At the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB of this year so far, it was confirmed that the 3% rate would apply to the Eurosystem's next main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This level is based on the Governing Council's current assessment of the economic situation, viewed from the perspective of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">First, monetary growth in recent months has been broadly in line with the quantitative reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This, together with further analysis of the monetary data, signals that monetary developments are consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">Of course, monetary growth relative to the reference value should always be interpreted in a medium-term context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.11,0)">Short-run deviations from the reference value are inevitable and, while being monitored and assessed carefully, would not automatically signal an immediate threat to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the three-month moving average of the annual growth rates of M3 up to December 1998 stood at 4.7%, very close to the reference value of 4½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Second, as regards the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments, a number of indicators have recently proved noteworthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.35,0)">Following the co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December, long-term interest rates have also fallen, suggesting that financial markets viewed the cut favourably and considered it to be consistent with the credible maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.81,0)">According to revised Eurostat estimates, real GDP growth remained broadly robust in the third quarter of 1998, while in more recent months activity may have slowed down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.14,0)">Such a slowdown is apparent in industrial production growth up to November 1998, in particular in the intermediate goods sector, which is particularly sensitive to any deterioration in the external environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, at the same time, production of capital goods and consumer durables has continued to expand rather strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.4,0)">A similar pattern can be observed in the decline in industrial confidence that has been apparent in the second half of 1998 in the euro area, while, however, stabilising in January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">On the other hand, consumer confidence in the euro area continued to increase in December and in January; it has now exceeded the peak level reached in 1990, with retail sales up to November showing continued solid growth and car sales growing strongly during the last months of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.09,0)">Finally, the mixed picture is confirmed by other data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Order books, which overall declined slightly further in December, apparently increased again in January, particularly with respect to export orders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.27,0)">Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which started to decrease in the third quarter recovered again thereafter, while December data on unemployment appear to suggest that the decline in unemployment rates stalled around year-end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.41,0)">Therefore, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data seem to confirm our earlier assessment that there are downside risks for output growth and that production may have slowed down around the turn of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.71,0)">Nonetheless, there are also no clear signals as yet of a stronger than expected weakening in output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Given this mixed picture, it should be emphasised that further thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends are needed before any conclusions can be drawn concerning the broad outlook for 1999 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.9,0)">Against this background, the annual rate of increase in the HICP for the euro area slowed further in December, falling to 0.8% as compared with 0.9% in November and 1.0% in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This reduction in the rate of increase of the HICP resulted from further moderation of food price increases and continued falls in energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">On balance, the general environment continued to suggest that there is no significant upward or downward pressure on the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Of course, the Governing Council is fully aware that potential risks to price stability do exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.63,0)">On the one hand, downward risks could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.29,0)">On the other, fiscal indiscipline by national governments failing to respect the Stability and Growth Pact or inflationary wage settlements could threaten the 2% upper bound of the Eurosystem's published definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In addition, exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely given their importance for domestic price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.03,0)">The international role of the euro and the ECB Changes in the external environment - that is, in the economic condition and performance of countries outside the euro area - may affect the outlook for price developments within the euro area, and thereby the conduct of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.21,0)">The effects of financial crises on external demand and business confidence are a notable recent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">However, this relationship works in both directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has created a single currency area of a size and importance and with a population broadly similar to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.2,0)">An event of this magnitude is likely to have major implications for the rest of the world, especially the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the remainder of my speech, I shall consider some of these implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In its monetary policy strategy, the Eurosystem deliberately does not specify a target for the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar or the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Although it will always stand ready to exchange views with other central banks concerning the development of exchange rates, there are no explicit or implicit target zones for the euro exchange rate against non-EU currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The euro area is a large, relatively closed economy, similar in this respect to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.45,0)">Pursuing a target for the euro exchange rate could easily jeopardise the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The level of interest rates required to sustain an exchange rate target may, in some cases, not be that which best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.91,0)">I might add that it may also conflict with the achievement of other domestic policy objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.54,0)">It could be very painful if it were necessary to raise interest rates in a recession in order to defend the exchange rate of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Finally, it should be acknowledged that today we are living in a world with high capital mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.48,0)">Exchange rate arrangements that could be implemented thirty years ago may no longer be feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.24,0)">The required amount of foreign exchange reserves could simply be too large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Within the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy, the euro exchange rate is the outcome of current and expected economic policies and developments in both the euro area and elsewhere, and of the market participants' perception of these policies and developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.85,0)">Supporting the Eurosystem's approach, the Ministers of Finance, who are assigned ultimate responsibility for the exchange rate of the euro by the Maastricht Treaty, have agreed not to issue so-called "general orientations" for the exchange rate policy to the Eurosystem other than in clearly exceptional circumstances, such as when there is a substantial and persistent misalignment of the euro against other currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.75,0)">However, the absence of a target for the exchange rate of the euro against major international currencies does not imply that the ECB ignores or is indifferent to the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar or the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As I already said earlier, the exchange rate will be monitored as one of the indicators of monetary policy, within the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments that constitutes one pillar of the overall strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.73,0)">Nor does the absence of exchange rate targets suggest that these rates will necessarily be unstable or volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">On the contrary, the pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies puts in place one of the major prerequisites for stable euro exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The Eurosystem's stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is a significant contribution in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.27,0)">Absolute stability of the exchange rate is, of course, impossible to guarantee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.55,0)">It would not even be desirable if, for example, the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles that were not fully synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This possibility cannot be ruled out, as even recent history has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.47,0)">We are aware that the emergence of an international role for the euro may sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy if a significant proportion of the money stock is circulating outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Nevertheless, the Eurosystem will accept the international role of the euro as it develops as a result of market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">To the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in meeting its mandate and maintaining price stability, it will also automatically foster the use of the euro as an international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The pace at which the euro will emerge as an international currency is hard to predict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">If history is taken as a guide, it will be a gradual process, but it is possible that, in today's more dynamic and flexible financial markets, the euro could assume a prominent role more rapidly than past experience might suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, I should like to discuss briefly the role of the ECB in international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">As the representative of a monetary union comparable in size and importance to the United States and as the central bank managing a currency that is likely to play a large and increasing international role, the ECB will inevitably play an important role in the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The ECB will embrace the implied responsibility, but at the same time it will have to be modest and realistic in its actions on the international stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Its role will develop over time, drawing on the experience of those national central banks that have played an important international role in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the end of last year, the ECB was accorded observer status at the International Monetary Fund  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.73,0)">Full membership of the IMF is restricted to individual nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate fully in the relevant work and assessment by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ECB also participates in the work of the G-7, the G-10, the Bank for International Settlements and the OECD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It enjoys good bilateral relations with other central banks throughout the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The ECB stands ready to participate fully in, and contribute to, international policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It will, of course, offer expertise and exchange views, when and where appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, in general, the best contribution the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system, including stable exchange rates and well-functioning international capital markets, is to maintain price stability within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Fulfilling the mandate assigned to the ESCB by the Treaty on European Union will help the ECB to meet its international responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Concluding remarks The euro has arrived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB has taken up the reins of monetary sovereignty in the euro area and a truly single monetary policy has been in place for five weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">For those of us who have been involved in the long and at times arduous preparations for Monetary Union, this is an occasion which provides a sense of satisfaction.</span><span style="background-color:
