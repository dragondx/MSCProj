    <span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)"> EU Enlargement: challenges and opportunities Keynote speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBheld at the conference‘Europe’s frontiers: EU enlargement - its implications and consequences’, organised by the Calouste Gulbenkian FoundationLisbon, 27 October 2004 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour and pleasure to address this conference organised by the prestigious Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I have been asked to speak about the recent enlargement of the European Union and its implications and consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Being a central banker, you should not be surprised that I will focus especially on the economic aspects of enlargement and share with you the ECB’s views about the main challenges and opportunities that the “new” Member States are likely to face on their way to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In many respects, the experience of Portugal appears to be of relevance when thinking about the implications of joining the European Union and later on the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Portugal’s accession to the EU back in 1986 was a major step for the country, probably similar to the experience that the “new” Member States from Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean currently make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Portugal clearly benefited from joining the EU as this promoted macroeconomic stability and facilitated structural changes that the country had to undertake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Thus, EU membership was indeed a decisive factor for economic growth and a higher standard of living in Portugal, and consequently for Europe as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The accession of ten new countries to the European Union on 1 May 2004 has been in many respects the largest enlargement round in European history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me illustrate this with some figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In geographical terms, Europe’s territory expanded by around 23% following accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">With 75 million people living in the “new” Member States, the population of the EU increased by about one fifth to 455 million people in total.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The enlarged EU consolidates its position in the first league of the world’s biggest unified markets, accounting for about one fourth of world trade and global income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In some respects, the 2004 enlargement should not be over-dramatized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.41,0)">In particular the economic weight of the “new” Member States is still rather limited, amounting to only 4.6% of the GDP of the enlarged EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.71,0)">Just for comparison, this is well below the increase in the EU’s total GDP following the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986, which amounted to more than 8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.85,0)">The small economic weight of the “new” Member States is mainly a consequence of the low per-capita income levels that most of the countries had at the beginning of the transition process to a market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This, however, will change gradually in the future as the catching-up process progresses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I would like today to concentrate on three main aspects that are of particular relevance for the ECB: First, I would focus on the main implications of EU enlargement on growth and welfare in the European Union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Then, I would like to address the perspectives of monetary integration of the “new” Member States, and finally, I would like to touch upon the challenges for the “new” Member States to follow and adhere to stability-oriented policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The enlargement will have positive implications on growth in the European Union What are the main economic implications of EU enlargement for Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In the public debate, there seems to be widespread agreement that the enlargement of the EU would be particularly beneficial for the “new” Member States, while the implications for the “previous” Member States are expected to be less positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.56,0)">In fact, some people seem to be afraid of mass migration, abuse of the Western European welfare systems or wage and tax dumping.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Most of these concerns remind me of the discussions we were confronted with in the past when there were similar reservations against the Southern European countries joining the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Not only on the back of the very positive experience we have made after the Southern enlargements of the EU in the 1980s, I strongly believe that the concerns regarding the most recent enlargement round are largely exaggerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.65,0)">More generally, I sense that the benefits of enlargement are often ignored in such discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I am convinced that EU enlargement has created a win-win situation, with positive implications for economic growth and welfare in both the “new” and the “previous” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Of course the benefits to be expected by the new entrants would be very substantial, given their low starting point in per-capita income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">But for the European economy as a whole, EU enlargement will not only foster economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">It will increase competition, promote structural reforms and lead to higher productivity and potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Such economic benefits of EU enlargement are confirmed by several studies suggesting that the long-term impact of EU enlargement on real GDP in the “previous” Member States would account for up to 0.8 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">When identifying the main benefits of EU enlargement for the EU as a whole, let me stress that already the prospect of EU accession had positive implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This becomes especially apparent when looking at the degree of trade integration between the “previous” and “new” Member States, which increased significantly during the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Trade integration was largely supported by the removal of tariffs and quantitative restrictions for some industrial products well before accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Consequently, the “new” Member States re-oriented their trade flows to the existing EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At the same time the “previous” Member States were attracted by the potentially large markets in the “new” Member States, given the size of the population and the on-going catching-up in living standards in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Currently the “new” Member States’ share of export to the EU amounts on average to 67% of their total exports, while the share of imports coming from the “previous” Member States is at around 60% of total imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">In comparison, ten years ago the respective shares of imports and exports were below 50% With respect to the euro area countries, their export and import shares with the “new” Member States also increased significantly, standing currently at around 11% of total exports and imports, respectively, compared to 7% ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is not sufficiently known that the “new” Member States as a group are now one of the main trading partners of the “previous” EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.34,0)">The trade shares of the euro area with the new member states are only slightly lower than those with the United States   and are significantly higher than the euro area trade with Japan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Financial integration also intensified between the “previous” and “new” Member States prior to accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.05,0)">All “new” Member States recorded large and increasing capital inflows in recent years, reflecting their limited capital stock, a high marginal return on capital and on average low saving ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Financial integration was also supported by the liberalisation of most capital movements, which took place well before accession, thus already anticipating the Treaty obligations for EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">By far the largest component of capital flows was foreign direct investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Around 80% of FDI in the “new” Member States originated from the “previous” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Looking at it from the perspective of the previous Member States, around 12% of their FDI outflows are currently directed towards the “new” Member States, which is three times higher compared to five years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.73,0)">Compared to other important FDI recipients from the EU-15, FDI flows to the “new” Member States are still lower than those directed to the United States, but considerably larger than those to Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">An additional indicator of the advanced degree of financial integration between the “new” and “previous” Member States is the very substantial level of FDI in the banking sector of the “new” Member States coming from the “15”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Moreover, the prospect of the ten countries joining the European Union has anchored the design of economic policies in the “new” Member States and by this also helped to “frontload” a number of important reform measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Thus, the European Union served as a catalyst for structural and institutional changes in the “new” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In my view, the most important examples in this respect were the orientation of their monetary policies towards price stability and the willingness to grant their central banks independence long before entering the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The statute of the European System of Central Banks was very helpful in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Besides past achievements, after accession economic and financial integration will intensify further, which will contribute to more growth in the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In fact, additional trade and investment opportunities arise in the EU following the removal of remaining technical barriers to trade between the “previous” and “new” Member States and the extension of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the past, some economic and legal uncertainties in the “new” Member States have apparently prevented in particular small and medium-sized companies of the EU-15 from investing more in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">With accession, however, this has been changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In fact, one can already observe that the small and medium sized companies are becoming significantly more active now in the “new” Member States, as they take advantage of the mostly high-skilled labour force and the favourable cost situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In addition to more integration, enlargement leads to higher competition in the EU and enhances the scope for economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.42,0)">It is important to note that also the “previous” Member States will be affected by higher competition in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This consecutively could accelerate structural reforms in the “previous” EU countries, thereby improving the outlook of potential growth in the EU as a whole and contributing to the implementation of the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In fact, the “new” Member States seem to be overall rather competitive and have already made large progress in implementing structural reforms in some areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The monetary integration of the “new” Member States will be carefully prepared Let me now turn to the process of monetary integration in the “new” Member States, which is also likely to have positive implications for Europe as a whole by fostering economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As you know, accession to the EU is only the beginning of the monetary integration process, which ends with the eventual adoption of the euro, as these countries have fully subscribed to the Maastricht Treaty without asking for an opting-out clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The path towards euro adoption is embedded in a well-defined multilateral institutional framework and comprises a number of phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first phase for the “new” Member States is the period after EU accession and before joining the exchange rate mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As you know, this mechanism defines a regime characterised by fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, with a central rate against the euro and a standard fluctuation band of   The “new” Member States need to maintain stability-oriented policies To ensure that the process of monetary integration will be successful, it is important for the “new” Member States to conduct overall consistent and stability-oriented economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Moreover, a stable macroeconomic environment and progress in structural and fiscal reforms are also essential to take full advantage of the benefits of EU enlargement and to support the catching-up process in per-capita income levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Thereby, stability-oriented policies and structural reforms will ensure that real and nominal convergence can be achieved in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">I would like to focus on two challenges that I believe are of crucial importance to the “new” Member States in view of monetary integration and real convergence, namely the challenge to ensure price stability and to foster fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Price stability is an essential requirement for a successful monetary integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">At the same time it could contribute by fostering trade and investment to a more rapid catching-up process in real income levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.31,0)">Where do countries currently stand with respect to price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In fact, as I already mentioned earlier the “new” Member States have already made considerable progress in terms of disinflation in the past years, by bringing the average inflation rate in the “new” Member States closer to the one in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.05,0)">Recently, however, inflation rates have started to pick-up again in most of the “new” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">The recent increase in inflation was mainly related to supply-side factors such as developments in food and energy prices and indirect tax changes in the context of EU accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In addition, it should be born in mind that further upward pressures on prices are expected in the context of the catching-up process of the “new” Member States and the liberalisation of administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Against this background, the “new” Member States will be confronted with the task to contain the pick-up in inflation rates in a controlled and moderate fashion, without substantial adverse effects on inflation expectations and future wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Moreover, for those countries that have not yet fully completed the disinflation process the main challenge will be to lastingly contain inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Besides solid macroeconomic policy frameworks and prudent wage policies, progress in structural reforms can be regarded as being conducive to price stability by improving the supply side of the economy and enhancing growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Moreover, sound fiscal policies are also crucial with respect to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This brings me to the second challenge I want to discuss briefly, namely the need to foster fiscal consolidation and achieve sound fiscal positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.59,0)">Although the fiscal situation varies across countries fiscal deficits are on average high and even very high in a number of “new” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.59,0)">It is clear that fiscal consolidation is a major challenge for most of the “new” Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.4,0)">Their governments are confronted with competing expenditure demands, including inter alia public investment in infrastructure and the need to strengthen the effectiveness of public administration and the judicial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Consequently, policy-makers have to design and implement a credible consolidation path based on durable and growth-enhancing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It is important to bear in mind that fiscal consolidation in the “new” Member States becomes increasingly important in view of their further monetary integration and is particularly essential for a smooth participation in ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Ladies and Gentleman, I should like to make two remarks in conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">First, I would like to stress the historical importance of this enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It proves that the visionary founding fathers of Europe were right in trusting political democracy, human rights, civil liberties and market economies, were right in sticking to their common beliefs during half a century and in inventing a bold, unique and highly successful concept of Union which has no historical precedent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It is a formidable historical achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">And, second, I will share with you a very profound belief that I have acquired progressively over the last fifteen years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let us not underestimate the rapidity of the present pace of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">When we negotiated the Maastricht Treaty we were still 12!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.15,0)">The negotiators did not realise that we were potentially much more numerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We all had difficulty in understanding that we were experiencing an acceleration in the course of history… Within two days, a new Constitution will be signed in Rome by 25 European governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.71,0)">And we know that we are already more numerous : 28 and even more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Europe – and the entire planet – is advancing, changing, transforming itself much more rapidly now than was the case in the 50’s, 60’s, 70’s and 80’s of the last century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is important that we are all fully aware of that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It undoubtedly increases uncertainties and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.7,0)">For uncertainty is the very mark of history in the making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">But it also multiplies chances and opportunities, including within the economic sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It is up to us to make the best of these opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
