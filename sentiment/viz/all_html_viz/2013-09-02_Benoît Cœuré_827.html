    <span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)"> Outright Monetary Transactions, one year on Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the conference “The ECB and its OMT programme”,organised by Centre for Economic Policy Research,German Institute for Economic Research and KfW Bankengruppe Berlin, 2 September 2013 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen  , One year after the inception of the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions  , financial markets in the euro area are in much calmer conditions and fragmentation is receding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.15,0)">Yet, OMTs have created turmoil elsewhere: in the hallways of economics faculties, newspaper commentaries and, maybe, across dinner tables in Europe; today, it is not government bond spreads but emotions that are running high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I very much welcome this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">It is important for citizens to inform themselves about monetary policy decisions, and public debate among experts can help them arrive at a balanced assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As the euro is shared by 330 million Europeans, it is crucial that such a debate brings together different European perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.42,0)">It cannot serve the euro well to take a parochial view of its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">I am therefore grateful to the organisers for arranging this conference and inviting me to explain the rationale and key design features of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me address three issues – and come back to them in turn: First, the necessity of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Here, I will recall the circumstances that made OMTs necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Second, the effectiveness of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will explain why OMTs were effective from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Finally, the robustness of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I will show that the design of OMTs is resistant to the criticisms that have been voiced in the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">Why OMTs are necessary So let me start by considering why OMTs are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Here, two things have to be acknowledged: first, all the ECB’s policy actions and instruments fully serve our objective of price stability in the euro area as a whole and, second, one year ago, we were facing serious challenges in achieving precisely this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So, let me elaborate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.48,0)">When OMTs were announced in August 2012, financial fragmentation had created widely divergent borrowing costs for firms and households across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.52,0)">As a result, the transmission of monetary policy was severely impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.11,0)">First, we saw impairments to the traditional inter-temporal arbitrage mechanism, which curtailed the effectiveness of our standard monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">Second, horizontal and spatial fragmentation – that is, impairments across banks, markets and countries resulting from structural impairments have challenged monetary policy operating with a single instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">These dynamics were exacerbated by an adverse feedback due to the close association between banks and their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">These two dimensions of fragmentation have been mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.56,0)">For example, the lack of cross-border liquidity in the interbank market impaired the price-finding mechanism along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.46,0)">As a result, our monetary policy impulses were not evenly transmitted across countries or adequately along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.0,0)">Furthermore, we saw the emergence of a tail-risk in the euro area, which triggered self-perpetuating dynamics in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.55,0)">A “bad equilibrium” of an adverse scenario was possible, triggered by self-fulfilling and reinforcing expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">In this adverse scenario, the expectation of one or more countries exiting the euro would have driven public and private financing costs in these countries to such a high level that they would have had no other option than to actually exit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">It is clear that the root causes of the adverse scenario were associated with substantial losses in competitiveness, lack of fiscal sustainability and financial risks in national banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.33,0)">But an additional factor became prominent: redenomination risk, reflecting fears of a possible imminent euro area break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">While exchange rate risk across euro area countries should have disappeared permanently with the creation of the single currency, there were signs, early in 2012 and increasingly so during that summer, that investors had started pricing in redenomination risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Investors perceived the monetary union as having turned from a single currency area into a fixed nominal exchange rate system cursed with the classic “peso problem”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Investors required an interest rate premium to compensate for the risk that the euro might not remain the irreversible currency of the euro area – at least in its current composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, redenomination risk was apparent in the market for government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.17,0)">The inversion of the slope of the term structure of sovereign bond spreads observed in early summer 2012, for instance, for Spain and Italy was consistent with expectations of imminent break-up risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.71,0)">Markets perceived a high probability that obligations might not be repaid in full or equivalently be repaid in a different, lower-valued currency, which translated into higher spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.86,0)">If the probability of this event increases over the short horizon, then the cumulative default probability for longer horizons cannot rise much further, and inversion of the spread curve necessarily follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Overall, in the first half of 2012, the pricing of redenomination risk led to a significant and rapid increase in spreads between government bonds in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.59,0)">These divergences could not be explained by changes in fiscal or macroeconomic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For example, the spreads of Spanish and Italian ten-year government bonds relative to Germany increased by 250 basis points and 200 basis points respectively in July 2012 compared with one year before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In neither of the two countries had fundamentals changed so spectacularly to justify such a drastic re-pricing of sovereign risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The Italian government had taken measures which would lead to a reduction in the deficit below the reference value of 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The Spanish government had just embarked on a series of reforms redressing long-standing problems in the labour market and in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Despite this, the compensation that investors were asking for the risk to hold Spanish or Italian bonds was almost twice as large as one year before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.17,0)">The distortions were not limited to long maturities but observed in all segments of the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For example, as of July 2012, the spreads on Spanish and Italian two-year government bonds relative to Germany were averaging around 500 basis points and 400 basis points respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">Why were these sovereign bond market developments relevant from an ECB perspective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In any economy, the government bond market plays a prominent role in the transmission of monetary policy and ultimately matters for the effective achievement of the central bank’s objective – in our case, price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Changes in long-term government bond yields are an important driver of corporate bond yields and bank lending rates – either through arbitrage relations or through sovereign bonds directly serving as a benchmark for the pricing of loans and other assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Through this channel and others, the sovereign bond market turmoil rapidly spilled over to banks and ultimately reached households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.47,0)">As a consequence, the entire economy’s lending conditions deteriorated significantly in the countries under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">The implications of the crisis were not confined to countries under stress but also visible in core euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">With fears of a euro area break up growing, core euro area economies became the destination of safe haven flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.84,0)">Liquidity was suddenly drying up in stressed countries, threatening to lead to a destructive downward spiral of abrupt deleveraging, fire sales and ultimately deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.1,0)">By contrast, there was a risk that abundant liquidity in core countries would unduly drive down financing conditions and fuel asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.3,0)">In fact, as market interest rates were surging in countries under stress, they declined in core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">German two-year government bond yields turned negative in early July 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.9,0)">Deposit outflows and increased recourse to central bank borrowing as a substitute for the lack of alternative funding were reflected in intra-euro area payment imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Target balances, an indicator of euro area fragmentation and capital market malfunction, reached an all-time high at levels above €1,000 billion in the summer of 2012, even though current account imbalances were already being reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.49,0)">In this challenging environment, we were losing the steering function of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The single monetary policy had shifted from “one size fits all” to “one size fits none”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me make a general remark at this stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.38,0)">How should central bankers act in such an environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.1,0)">Policy makers have always the option of doing nothing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Within their mandate, they can choose to respond actively to the crisis by rethinking and potentially revising the appropriate set of policy instruments, or, alternatively, they can be passive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.02,0)">Being passive is, however, not an innocent policy stance, but a policy choice itself with potentially harmful implications for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">As John F. Kennedy once observed, “There are risks and costs to action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.42,0)">But they are far less than the long-range risks of comfortable inaction.” And in the ECB’s case, passivity is not an option if it means failing to reach our objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is our unequivocal duty, enshrined in the Treaty, to do whatever it takes within our mandate to fulfil our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So how should active monetary policy be conducted in such an environment, within the central bank’s mandate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First and foremost, monetary policy should aim to repair the transmission of monetary policy by reducing fragmentation, insofar as it is not related to structural causes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In this respect, it has been argued that reducing fragmentation can imply a redistribution of risk in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For example, central banks can provide insurance policies against a tail event associated with a catastrophic scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The main insight here is that redistribution of risk is not a zero-sum game, but that the overall risk in the economy, in our case in the monetary union, can be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">I agree with this view, but I would also like to stress that any such insurance provided by the central bank should come with appropriate safeguards to mitigate moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">I will come back to that point later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">As our main policy response to the crisis, we announced our decision to implement OMTs in the secondary government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.26,0)">Let me be clear: OMTs are not going to interfere with the pricing of sovereign bonds on the basis of economic fundamentals and the respective credit and liquidity risks of the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.97,0)">The goal of OMTs is a narrow one: to eliminate the unwarranted and self-reinforcing fears of a euro area break-up that have undermined our ability to effectively conduct monetary policy in the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this respect, OMTs are an instrument tailored to the multiple equilibrium problem outlined above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Why OMTs are effective Have OMTs been effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">OMTs were able to address the impairments to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by reducing fragmentation and restoring the distributional neutrality of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It has eliminated fears of disasters and removed denomination risk from the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">How was this possible without spending a single euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">OMTs are an insurance device against redenomination risk, in the sense of reducing the probability attached to worst-case scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">As for any insurance mechanism, OMTs face a trade-off between insurance and incentives, but their specific design was effective in aligning ex ante incentives with ex post efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will come back later to the reasons why OMTs are incentive-compatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">So, what evidence is there that OMTs have been effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">One year after the announcement, the positive effects of OMTs are visible in several key indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">First, distortions on the sovereign debt markets have receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.67,0)">Compared with their peak before the OMT announcement, spreads on ten-year government bonds for Italy and Spain, for example, are now back around levels observed in the summer of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.83,0)">Moreover, CDS spreads have gone down in all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Second, bank and firm borrowing conditions have eased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.55,0)">Corporate bond spreads in stressed countries have declined substantially, giving creditworthy companies better access to market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This has been observed not only for highly rated large corporations but also for other corporations, for the financial as well as the non-financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Third, banks have been able to re-access the market, for both funding and raising capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.32,0)">Also, the strong divergence in funding costs across countries has fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Deposits outflows have been reversed: deposits by euro area residents at banks in stressed countries have increased by about €210 billion since August 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.41,0)">These improvements in the form of reduced fragmentation can be summarised by the downward trend in Target balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.61,0)">These have been reduced by about €300 billion or some 30% from their peak one year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">They have now returned to levels observed before the two three-year LTROs at the end of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In sum, these indicators point to significant benefits from OMTs for corporations, banks as well as individuals in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Fears of a possible euro area break-up have receded and impairments to the transmission mechanism have been partly reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Why OMTs are robust Does this favourable market response mean that OMTs do not raise concerns?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The answer is: no, but these concerns have been discussed in depth by the Governing Council, and adequately mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.68,0)">The easing of financial turmoil is, in itself, not sufficient for a positive assessment of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In fact, for OMTs to be successful, they not only have to eliminate risk in the market, but they also have to do it in a controlled and incentive-compatible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.47,0)">It has been argued that: first, government bond purchases undermine incentives for reform at national level; second, government bond purchases expose the ECB to balance sheet risks that may eventually lead to fiscal redistribution among euro area countries; and third, government bond purchases violate the monetary financing prohibition because they directly affect the conditions on which governments can issue debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.05,0)">I don’t address here a fourth objection, namely that buying government bonds would be conducive to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB has all the instruments at hand to retain control of its monetary stance, whether OMTs are activated or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me explain how OMTs address each of these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.9,0)">Incentives for reform The argument on incentive compatibility goes as follows: sovereign bond markets act as a disciplining device; if governments adopt imprudent economic policies they face higher interest rates in the market; as a consequence, they are forced to take corrective action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.62,0)">But the incentive for such corrective action is undermined if the central bank shields governments from market pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.76,0)">In this case, governments can, to some extent, choose whether they adopt painful fiscal and structural adjustment – or delay their reform efforts and just count on further support from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">On a general level, this argument is convincing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.07,0)">Certainly, the euro area needs an active and freely functioning government bond market, and lack of market discipline was one of the failures that have led to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But when applying it to the case in hand, one should not ignore the most important feature of OMTs, namely their explicit link to policy conditionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This feature distinguishes them from other historical episodes of central bank intervention in government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.86,0)">And it renders the argument on incentive incompatibility invalid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.24,0)">This is because conditionality removes the privilege of governments to choose between economic adjustment and central bank intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Even if the ECB were to decide – at its full discretion – to buy bonds via OMTs, governments would have to continue their reform efforts as required by the respective ESM programme and by IMF involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.65,0)">Otherwise, they would simply become ineligible for OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Hence, no reforms, no OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In fact, the policy conditionality not only aligns incentives in the countries already subject to an ESM programme, but it also aligns incentives in countries that are at risk of requiring support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.56,0)">This is because, in the programme context, national authorities face a substantial loss of sovereignty with regard to economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.27,0)">The political cost related to this loss of sovereignty constitutes a forceful deterrent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Indeed, the experience with existing EU/IMF programmes shows that governments request official assistance only if it is strictly unavoidable through their own efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In other words, there is no incentive for governments to wait and do nothing until they move into an ESM programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">By contrast, they have an incentive to put all their efforts into solving their problems without having to request a programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">Besides, purchases under OMTs are limited to shorter-dated bonds, namely, up to the three-year tenor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.53,0)">Government yields at longer maturities would be entirely determined by market forces, and at shorter maturities, and fear of the programme running off track and OMT eligibility being lost would be reflected in market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Overall, these points demonstrate that OMTs do not eliminate the market as a disciplining device for governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">What OMTs do do is to complement the market, which in the current crisis has been abrupt and unreliable, by another incentive mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">Risks to the ECB’s balance sheet Let me turn to the second argument, which is related to the ECB’s risk exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Thus far, we are in a comfortable situation: the desirable effects of OMTs have materialised without a single euro being spent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.35,0)">In fact, risks to the balance sheet of the ECB have vastly decreased since mid-2012, thanks to the convergence in yields and a marked decrease in central bank borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But let’s be clear: if we were to conduct bond purchases via OMTs, the Eurosystem would assume the concomitant balance sheet risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.13,0)">Under an extreme scenario, with the default of the sovereign concerned, the resulting losses would have to be shared across the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Ultimately, this could indeed constitute a transfer of risk between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let me make three remarks on this: First, it is precisely the existence of OMTs that contains the risk of such catastrophic scenarios materialising, since: by their very existence OMTs eliminate the undue spread components and hence self-fulfilling default trajectories; through conditionality OMTs foster incentives for sound economic and fiscal policies; and by focusing on bonds with shorter residual maturity, they limit the duration of the risk exposure to a given creditor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Second, any risk comes with a reward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Under a successful OMT programme, interest payments on the bonds purchased by the ECB amount to a transfer from the benefiting country to the ECB, then to the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Third, and more fundamentally, one can argue that a certain transfer of risk between different geographical areas is inevitable and inherent in the implementation of a single monetary policy for any currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Indeed, for the euro area geographically diverse risk exposure is not new and has always been part of the way we conduct and implement monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Think, for example, about our main instrument for monetary policy: collateralised liquidity provision via our repo operations with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">Here, the decision on the geographical allocation of liquidity across countries is not at the discretion of the ECB: it is essentially market-driven and depends on the liquidity needs of the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Hence the transfer of risk across countries is inherent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Moreover, the transfer of risk is inevitable because a decentralised allocation of liquidity is a pre-condition for achieving our mandate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.45,0)">If we were to impose a specific distribution of liquidity across countries we would have to renege on our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In sum, and as discussed above, monetary policy can be redistributive provided that it aims to restore distributive neutrality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For OMTs, it is in essence the same as for our standard framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.85,0)">The transfer is inherent to the motivation of OMTs because sources of impaired monetary policy transmission are unevenly distributed geographically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.33,0)">It is inevitable because imposing constraints on OMTs due to risk-sharing considerations would weaken its effectiveness and hamper the ECB in its pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me say a more general word on the distributional neutrality of monetary policy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.65,0)">Central banks are entrusted with a narrow mandate and, being independent, they are shielded from representative politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">They should refrain from engaging in income redistribution, which should be sanctioned by parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">This does not imply that monetary policy actions do not have distributive consequences – in fact, they always have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But these are the side-effects of a strategy that aims to ensure price stability, which is by essence neutral as regards income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">OMTs are just one aspect of such a strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.72,0)">The emergence of redenomination risk resulted into a situation where monetary policy decisions were not evenly transmitted to specific market segments and regions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">OMTs supported the distributional neutrality of our monetary policy by addressing the underlying impairments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.68,0)">The prohibition of monetary financing A final concern that has been raised regarding OMTs is whether it violates the monetary financing prohibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me focus on the economic aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.36,0)">The economic rationale of the monetary financing prohibition is clear: as history has shown, central banks cannot ensure price stability if they have to permanently make up for weak performance in other policy domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union applies this historical lesson to the architecture of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The aim and design of OMTs fully respect this economic requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To see this, we again have to recall the concrete design elements of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The first design element that is relevant here is, once more, the link to conditionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As mentioned before, the link to policy conditionality of an ESM programme ensures that central bank intervention via OMTs does not replace reform efforts in other policy domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Rather, OMTs can – by design – only be a complement to national reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.58,0)">Hence, the design of OMTs clearly prevents a scenario of harmful central bank support, or fiscal dominance over the central bank that has motivated the monetary financing prohibition; that is: the central bank intervenes, although – or even because – other economic policies fail to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The second element to keep in mind is the rationale of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.69,0)">To be clear: OMTs would never be used to indiscriminately push down government bond spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">By contrast, spreads should continue to reflect the underlying country-specific economic fundamentals, fiscal positions and market risk perceptions that incentivise governments to engage in sustainable fiscal spending and competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.74,0)">Hence also on this count, OMTs do not correspond to the harmful scenario that motivated the monetary financing prohibition; a scenario in which the very purpose of central bank intervention is to reduce yields below the fundamentally justified level so as to preserve debt sustainability despite weak policy performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.43,0)">The aim of OMTs is the exact opposite: a deterioration of fundamentals would induce the ECB to lower or even stop OMT intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">OMTs would only aim at that portion of the bond yield spreads that is not fundamentally justified and based on undue risks of a euro area break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">As I have said elsewhere  , central bank independence and a clear focus on price stability are necessary but not sufficient to ensure monetary dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The fiscal authority must be ready and willing to adjust its revenues and primary spending to stabilise its debt at any level of the interest rate that the central bank may choose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.6,0)">In academic parlance, for monetary policy to remain active, fiscal policy needs to be passive, or “Ricardian”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">By creating the right environment and providing appropriate incentives for governments to take action to ensure fiscal solvency, OMTs create the conditions to affirm the monetary dominance regime, which is at the heart of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Conclusion Let me just conclude, by repeating: OMTs are necessary from a monetary policy perspective; they were effective in counteracting the destructive market turmoil in the summer of last year; and they are designed in a way that overcomes the key concerns associated with government bond purchases by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">OMTs are not just words: the ECB is fully prepared to use them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But even if euro area Member States comply with the conditions, there is no automatism to activate OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For the Governing Council of the ECB, there is only one single deciding criterion and that is the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This overarching criterion has shaped the design of OMTs, and it will determine its potential activation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">I am
