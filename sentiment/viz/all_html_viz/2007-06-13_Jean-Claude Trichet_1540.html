    <span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)"> Economic integration and adjustment processes in the euro area Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the Wirtschaftstag 2007 as recipient of the “Ludwig Erhard Memorial Coin in Gold”Berlin, 13 June 2007 Introduction  Es ist mir eine große Ehre, als Ehrengast zu dieser Veranstaltung eingeladen zu sein und mit der Ludwig Erhard Gedenkmünze in Gold ausgezeichnet zu werden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Nicht nur Deutschland, sondern ganz Europa ist Ludwig Erhard zu Dank verpflichtet für seine mutige, auf den Prinzipien von freiem Wettbewerb, flexiblen Preisen und offenen Märkten beruhende Politik, und insbesondere für seine Ideen zum Konzept der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Er hat überdies auf die Bedeutung der Preisstabilität hingewiesen, welche er als menschliches Grundrecht aufgefasst hat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">He also stressed the importance of price stability, which he considered to be a basic human right.]</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">We are today – thanks to the work of Ludwig Erhard – confronted with exciting challenges and a unique historical development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The creation of the euro area is an exceptional endeavour, now comprising 13 countries, with the entry of Slovenia, and 318 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.87,0)">I remember many critical voices anticipating a failure and claiming that it would be impossible to share a single monetary policy and a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Let me be clear from the very beginning: while there are still formidable challenges and we should not be complacent, Economic and Monetary Union   has been a great success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.29,0)">Some people claim that the euro and our focus on price stability have undermined job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">I always put facts and figures first: over the eight years since the creation of the euro, employment in the euro area has risen by more than 12 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This can be compared with a rise of less than 3 million in the eight years preceding the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Obviously, I do not intend to give all the credit for this impressive employment growth to the creation of the euro alone, but it is difficult to deny that the solid anchoring of price stability for all our vast continental economy has contributed to this achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It is a fact that economic integration has increased among the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">However, it is also true that the creation of the euro area – like globalisation – highlights the need for flexible economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.79,0)">I do not see this as a negative aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">On the contrary, it is a positive implication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In this sense, EMU has increased the pressure on all policy-makers and also all social partners – and I stress the word “all”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">They must ensure a well-functioning euro area, by good management aimed at enhanced flexibility, integrated labour, product and financial markets and disciplined fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This leads me to the two main issues I would like to address this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, I would like to share with you some stylised facts on the features of the euro area’s economic integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Second, I will address the complex and important issue of how to ensure that economic adjustment mechanisms function properly in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.59,0)">Why are these topics so decisive, you may ask?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Economic integration benefits consumers through lower prices and leads to increased employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">It is also crucial to enhancing the adjustment mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">This, in turn, helps to improve the ability of economies to cope with various events, with various “shocks” as we say in economics, so as to prevent a country or a region from entering into a long-lasting period of recession or overheating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">These are very important issues because they are intrinsically linked to the welfare of our citizens and the continuing success of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Features of economic integration in the euro area Allow me to briefly elaborate on five main features of the process of economic integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The first three are related to the completion of the Single Market, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">the integration of goods, services, capital and labour markets across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">i) As to the first feature, economic integration has been reflected in a marked increase in intra-euro area trade in goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me provide you with some figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Exports and imports of goods within the euro area increased from about 26% of GDP in 1998, the year before the adoption of the common currency, to around 32% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 5% of GDP in 1998 to almost 7% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The full achievement of a single market for services should further facilitate trade in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">As this interdependence within the euro area becomes stronger, the euro area is also becoming a more open economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Extra-euro area exports and imports of goods rose from about 24% of GDP in 1998 to around 33% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the same period, extra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 8% of GDP to almost 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These developments clearly show that we are not witnessing the creation of a “fortress Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">On the contrary, European integration complements global integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">ii) As a second feature, the introduction of the euro has also contributed to financial integration which, in turn, improves the free movement of capital in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">First, financial integration raises the potential for stronger, non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">For example, recent research by London Economics estimated the benefits of the integration of EU bond and equity markets to be around 1 percentage point of additional GDP growth over a ten-year period, or approximately €100 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Second, a well-integrated financial system is, of course, also crucial for the conduct of the single monetary policy, as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Generally, financial integration is more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, especially the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">However, as I have stressed on several occasions, further financial integration is particularly needed in a number of areas, including in retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.77,0)">iii) Turning to labour mobility, which constitutes the third feature I would like to mention, available evidence suggests that, overall, cross-border labour mobility is still low in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And we still have formal barriers to labour mobility across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.62,0)">This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">iv) As a fourth feature, economic integration and convergence is also reflected in the fact that current inflation and output growth differences among euro area countries are relatively limited by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The differences also appear to be similar to those observed across regions or states within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.48,0)">I understand that some observers may like to create headline news from the differences in economic growth or inflation between some euro area countries in a specific quarter or year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But let me stress that it is absolutely normal in a monetary union, such as the euro area, for economic developments to differ across individual regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is also the case among regions in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.95,0)">Why is it normal?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">First, differences in growth rates and inflation may be related to catching-up phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A region which is relatively underdeveloped would, if not hindered by bad economic policies, be expected to grow at a rate above the currency area average and thus, over time, reach an income per capita level similar to the currency area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This process is highly welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Second, there are countries that are more advanced, in terms of structural reforms, than others and have therefore a higher growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.61,0)">Third, a country or region might also be exposed to country or region-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.74,0)">This specific shock may cause a growth or inflation differential, which is also normal in any monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.43,0)">However, it is also true that persistent differentials which reflect structural rigidities are a concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.14,0)">I will address this issue later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">v) Equally relevant for the conduct of the single monetary policy of the ECB is the fifth and final feature of economic integration I would like to mention to you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The degree of synchronisation or co-movement between the different cyclical positions across the euro area countries seems to have increased since the beginning of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In other words, a large number of euro area economies now share similar business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The increased co-movement of business cycles across the euro area economies has resulted from a continuous process of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The move from several currencies to a single currency has meant the elimination of exchange rate risk between countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro has also reduced information costs and has enhanced price transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">This, in turn, has fostered competition and market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In this way, the adoption of the euro has acted as a catalyst for the Single Market, within which goods, services, people and capital are to move freely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Ludwig Erhard said “ A free market can only be said to exist   if and as long as free performance competition and free price formation are the motor and means of steering the economy.”   In sum, there is evidence of stronger economic integration among the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Evidence of the completion of the Single Market looks promising, especially the rise in intra-euro area trade and integration in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.36,0)">Business cycles have become more synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This is an encouragement to continue to work actively to enhance integration, notably in the provision of services, in labour mobility and in the integration in some segments of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A lot of homework remains to be done in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Adjustment processes in the euro area Economic integration is a clear prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.89,0)">All the more because the euro area is continuously confronted with adverse events or shocks, for instance in the fields of global competition or energy price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.05,0)">In addition, individual euro area economies or regions may be affected by specific sectoral developments, for example in real estate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is therefore important to make sure that adjustment mechanisms function efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Why is an efficient adjustment mechanism important in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">As national monetary and exchange rate policies are no longer available options, it is important to make sure that other mechanisms of adjustment to shocks function properly within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.63,0)">This is needed to avoid a situation where a country or a region, after suffering a specific or asymmetric shock, enters either into a period of protracted low growth and high unemployment, or in a long period of overheating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">There are many factors that can improve the resilience of the euro area economies to adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But before addressing this issue, let me stress that the ECB’s single monetary policy contributes to the proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area by ensuring price stability, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">by anchoring price stability in economic agents’ decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">I believe that this is a very important contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In other words, the social partners when agreeing on wage increases, and also national authorities when preparing their budgets or designing policies in their fields of responsibility, should be, and, as a matter of fact, are fully confident that we at the ECB and in the Eurosystem will deliver price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.47,0)">On this issue, Ludwig Erhard said that “ It is a great mistake for a people, or a State, to believe that it can introduce and pursue an inflationary policy, yet insure itself against the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.54,0)">This is to try to lift oneself by one’s own bootlaces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">On the contrary, it is essential to concentrate all efforts to prevent an inflation  ”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And let me add that the best way of anchoring price stability in economic agents’ decisions is through an independent and accountable central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">German history provides the best possible example of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Turning to other factors which are particularly relevant for the proper functioning of the euro area, well-designed structural reforms that enhance flexibility in product and labour markets are crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This is helping to better absorb shocks and thereby improve the working of adjustment mechanisms in individual countries, regions or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In this context, the Lisbon strategy is a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw Europe’s attention to the urgency of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Such reforms would improve long-term growth prospects in the euro area by, on the one hand, affecting positively labour participation and, on the other hand, improving labour productivity growth through the promotion of innovation and technological change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Needless to say, the responsibility for the implementation of reforms is in the hands of national governments, of Parliaments and of social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.69,0)">We know very well that structural reforms may face both resistance from economic agents and different sensitivities in public opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">This is why it is extremely important to communicate the fact that the medium to long-term benefits of structural reforms will significantly outweigh any short-term cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">We therefore strongly support governments in their implementation of structural reforms and we consider our duty to stress and explain their benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">What factors may help to increase flexibility within the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Economic flexibility can be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible wage and price-setting mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">If wages and prices are flexible enough and be able to adjust to the changes in the economic conditions, then this will help to avoid unwelcome fluctuations in unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Specifically, in a monetary union most of the adjustment has to take place through national labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Therefore, wage setting should appropriately reflect the different situations of sectors, of firms and of overall labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me stress that governments and social partners share responsibility for ensuring that wage determination sufficiently takes into account labour market conditions and does not jeopardise competitiveness and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Governments should also be aware that wage setting in the public sector can serve as a role model for the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.14,0)">And social partners need to take into account the different conditions at the firm and sectoral level, internalising the repercussions of wage settlements on competitiveness and thus employment at their company and in their industry, sector or region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Sufficient wage differentiation would improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions or sectors with high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.99,0)">In this respect, excessive wage regulations are undermining job creation, in particular for young and less qualified workers as well as for all those who face problems entering the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Allow me to mention also that corporate governance should ensure that executive board remuneration is properly set, in line with the performance of the board members and conditions at the respective company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As seen in the German case, the period of adjustment can be painful, but reforms and unit labour cost moderation is paying off and contribute to robust growth and impressive economic records, like the one currently observed in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">I remember some observers arguing that much stronger wage increases were needed for higher growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.74,0)">The recent evidence does not confirm this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.64,0)">As seen in Germany since last year, past moderation of unit labour costs has very significantly contributed to declining unemployment and higher growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The competitiveness gained by the German economy was an important prerequisite for sustainable job creation and sound and long-lasting growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.36,0)">The proper functioning of adjustments through labour markets also requires the completion of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, all existing barriers to labour mobility within the euro area – in particular as regards Slovenians – must be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As to product markets, let me stress that it is essential that the Single Market must be fully completed, particularly in services and network industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">A deeper integration of markets would stimulate price flexibility by fostering competition and open product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Greater cross-border competition and the integration of markets across the euro area countries would contribute to lower prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">It could also enhance the adjustment processes in the individual countries in the event of asymmetric shocks or differing cyclical developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Another important market-based mechanism in a monetary union that can help to attenuate the impact of shocks in a country or region is well-integrated financial markets and readily available opportunities for portfolio diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Well-integrated financial markets and diversified portfolios reduce the dependence of firms’ and households’ saving and spending decisions on economic and financial developments in a specific country, region or sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This mechanism is known as the “credit and risk-sharing channels”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In essence, it means that consumption does not need to follow movements in regional output, first because consumers can borrow abroad and second because their financial wealth is less dependant on local conditions thanks to an internationally well diversified portfolio allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Moreover, more integrated financial markets give rise to greater competition, resulting in more favourable financing conditions for consumers and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This mechanism is more important in the United States than among the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, recent evidence shows that the degree of risk-sharing across euro area countries has increased since the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">National authorities can make a substantial contribution to ensuring a proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Not only can they improve the flexibility and integration of labour, product, including services, and financial markets, but they can also conduct a well-designed fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">As I have stressed on many occasions, the best contribution fiscal policy can make to the proper functioning of the euro area is by being sustainable and medium-term oriented, fully in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Moreover fiscal policy can and should also help mitigate undesirable trend growth differentials through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.68,0)">In particular, high and inefficient public expenditure can put a brake on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Let me take the opportunity to stress that the Governing Council of the ECB welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers at the Eurogroup meeting here in Berlin on 20April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">All euro area finance ministers then committed to making full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In the view of the Governing Council, this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets, the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For 2008, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than currently planned budgetary targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This would allow euro area countries not only to meet their commitments but also to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions and the rising fiscal burden in the longer run associated with population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In this context, the gradual increase of the pension age in Germany is an important step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It will help to reduce the large ageing-related fiscal burden on the active and younger generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me finally mention the important issue of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">One of the most important market-based adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union works via changes in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Simply put, competitiveness is the ability of an economy to compete in international markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This ability to compete is usually assessed on the basis of various measures of cost and price competitiveness  , complemented by accounting for some “non-price” factors, such as the quality and the technological content of the goods produced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Economic adjustment via the competitiveness channel works as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Assume, for example, that a country or a sector in a monetary union experiences an increase in demand that drives its output above long-term sustainable production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.57,0)">This will lead to inflationary pressures in this country or sector, in particular a rise in wages and other domestic costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.13,0)">As a result, competitiveness will gradually deteriorate over time, reducing demand for goods or services produced by this country or sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This decline in demand will tend to restore output to its potential level and to dampen previous inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Differences in price and cost competitiveness are observed between the various regions and states of any vast economy of the size of the euro area or of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The competitiveness channel plays a permanent role in the adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.64,0)">It is particularly justifiable, economically, when any particular economy has to cope with a demand shock, whether positive or negative, as in the previous example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.6,0)">Such differences are also a normal phenomenon when any particular economy is in the process of catching up, leading to a higher level of per capita income, or whenever an economy has to cope with structural changes or past shocks of any nature that would be reflected in a new relative price equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That being said, developments in price competitiveness and unit labour cost competitiveness across the euro area economies need to be closely monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.06,0)">Persistent losses in relative cost competitiveness, for instance, can also relate to a number of structural rigidities leading to inertia in price and wage formation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">If and when such phenomena are identified, it is important for all parties concerned - the private sector, social partners, the national public authorities - to be as lucid as possible in their own decision-making, to avoid relative losses of competitiveness that would not be economically justified and to minimise therefore possible unwelcome future adjustment through the competitiveness channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">M. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The single currency and Economic and Monetary Union have been an impressive and remarkable success, perhaps Europe’s most remarkable success since the Treaty of Rome was signed half a century ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It has been a success based upon a multinational and multipartisan consensus all over Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is up to all of us to consolidate this great success and ensure that it is reinforced in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">As regards monetary policy, Europe can count on the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem to be faithful to its primary mandate and to deliver price stability to our 318 million fellow citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This is a pre-requisite for sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As regards the other elements of policy that do not depend on the central bank, let me stress the three areas where sound policies are absolutely of the essence: sound fiscal policies, fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; structural reform policies, fully in line with the Lisbon program and the achievement of the Single Market; and appropriate monitoring of the relative cost competitiveness indicators in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Ludwig Erhard was a pioneer in understanding the utmost importance of price stability, of free and flexible markets and of competition for social and economic progress and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">We are also indebted to him for his thoughts and leadership that left a clear mark on the later negotiations for the preparations for Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">I am greatly honoured to receive the Ludwig Erhard Memorial Coin in Gold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">I thank Malin Andersson and Juan Luis Diaz del Hoyo who prepared this paper, Hans-Joachim Klöckers and Klaus Masuch for their helpful comments, and Arne Gieseck, Ruth Imkemeier and Philipp Rother for their additional input.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">“ A free economic order can only continue if and so long as the social life of the nation contains a maximum of freedom, of private initiative and of foresight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">If, on the other hand, social policy aims at granting a man complete security from the hour of birth, and protecting him absolutely from the hazards of life, then it cannot be expected that people will develop that full measure of energy, effort, enterprise and other human virtues which are vital to the life and future of the nation, and which, moreover, are the prerequisites for a social market economy based on individual initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">… It should not be denied that in modern industrialised countries even a good economic policy will have to be complemented by social policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">On the other hand it is true to say that every effective social aid will have to be based on an adequate and growing national income, which means an efficient economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Thus it must be in the interests of every organic social policy to secure an expanding and sound economy, and to take care that the principles guiding this economy are maintained and extended.” From: Ludwig Erhard, “Prosperity through Competition”  , Chapter 12 “Welfare State – The Modern Delusion”  , London 1958.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.99,0)">Baldwin “The euro’s trade effects” ECB Working Paper No 594, 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">London Economics, “Quantification of the macroeconomic impact of integration of EU financial markets”, report to the European Commission, 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.39,0)">Although the data available refer mostly to the 15 earliest members of the European Union, the EU15, they are still illustrative of the situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.8,0)">In 2000 only 0.1% of the total EU15 population   moved their official residence between two Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.82,0)">Furthermore, only a small proportion of individuals – 0.4% of the EU15 population – were known to commute across borders to work, and half of this amount was to a non EU15 country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In the United States, geographical labour mobility appears to be far higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">Evidence suggests that around 5.9% of the total US population moved their residence between US states in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">F.
