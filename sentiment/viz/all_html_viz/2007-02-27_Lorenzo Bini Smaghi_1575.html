    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.93,0)"> The governance of the euro area   Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the round table organised byHEC School of ManagementBrussels, 27 February 2007 Introduction The fact that the governance of the euro area is frequently discussed in academic and policy fora could suggest that the issue has not yet been settled, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.95,0)">that there is not yet a clear governance framework for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.08,0)">This impression is wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The Treaty provides a clear governance structure for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The real question that one should address is whether the existing governance functions adequately and, if not, whether it should be changed or better implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The existing economic governance of the euro area can be analysed from three main viewpoints: the policies, the goals and the institutions: Policies: monetary policy fiscal policies structural policies Goals: price stability income stabilisation sustainable long-term growth Institutions: European Central Bank   Eurogroup national governments The governance of the euro area can be assessed on the basis of several criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will concentrate on the criteria of effectiveness, accountability and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The following guiding principles can be adopted: effectiveness is pursued by assigning each policy instrument primarily to one objective; accountability is pursued by making each institution responsible primarily for one policy instrument; efficiency is pursued by designing institutional cooperation arrangements that allow each institution to take spillover effects into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These principles are incorporated in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As far as effectiveness is concerned, price stability is the main priority for monetary policy, cyclical stabilisation for budgetary policy and sustainable long-term growth for structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Accountability is ensured in particular by the fact that monetary policy is the responsibility of a separate institution, the European Central Bank, which has to give a regular account of its actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Cyclical stabilisation is assigned to national budgetary authorities and sustainable long-term growth to national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Finally, efficiency is ensured by a series of interinstitutional arrangements   ensuring dialogue and cooperation between the various policy decision-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">I will limit my analysis of the efficiency of the current governance of the euro area to three issues: monetary policy, the interaction between monetary policy and budgetary policies and the exchange rate policy of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Monetary policy and price stability The first eight years of EMU confirm that the choice to assign monetary policy one primary objective – price stability – has been correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In fact, since the Treaty was signed and ratified many other industrial and developing countries have modified the statutes of their central banks to make them independent and to assign them a clear objective, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Notable examples are Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway and Israel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In none of these countries is there any more discussion on the issue of central bank independence and on the responsibility for price stability, whether in the academic or political sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.96,0)">Yet now in the euro area the issue of changing again the Treaty to give the ECB a direct responsibility for growth as well as price stability is occasionally raised, often just before elections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.11,0)">It should be clarified from the outset that these proposals have very little chance, if any, of succeeding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Statute of the ESCB, which establishes independence and the primary objective of monetary policy, is enshrined in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Treaty cannot be changed, except with the unanimous support of 27 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The recent debate surrounding the French election campaign seems to suggest that no other country has any desire to change the Treaty in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.04,0)">The discussion on changing the Statute of the ESCB might therefore seem fairly theoretical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.53,0)">In fact one could think that the issue has been raised precisely because it is theoretical and has no chance of actually being implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.11,0)">What is then the reason behind this debate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.5,0)">One hypothesis is that by focusing the discussion on the ECB, the latter becomes the scapegoat for domestic policy shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.2,0)">The main excuse that is given by those who ask for a change in the Statute of the ESCB is that the Federal Reserve System has a dual mandate, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">not only price stability but both price stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">If the ECB had a dual mandate – so goes the argument – it could implement a policy more favourable to growth, while at the same time preserving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.94,0)">If the ECB had a dual mandate, it could – as the Federal Reserve System did between 2003 and 2004 – have pushed interest rates as low as 1%, thus giving a much greater stimulus to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me briefly explain why it would be inefficient in the current context to change the statute of an independent central bank so as to give it a dual objective of price stability and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will make four points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First, neither the economic literature nor the empirical evidence provides support to the hypothesis according to which, ceteris paribus, a central bank can systematically implement an expansionary monetary policy that would stimulate economic activity without producing more inflation over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Thus if the call for giving a dual mandate to the central bank is aimed at achieving systematically more growth, it is also implicitly an invitation to create more inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In fact, those that advocate a dual mandate implicitly suggest that inflation should be higher than the level targeted by the ECB  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.5,0)">Indeed, some of these advocates even go to the point of suggesting that the ECB is “obsessed” by inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">But is it really?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.73,0)">European-wide opinion surveys seem to suggest the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.53,0)">In the euro area, only a small minority of people consider that price stability is very well or fairly well ensured, while more than two-thirds think that it is not very well or not at all ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Furthermore, an overwhelming majority believes that it is important that the ECB preserves price stability and that the ECB should be independent in order to achieve this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Second, it is now widely recognised that in modern economies with developed and efficient financial markets, the best way for monetary policy to support economic growth, in particular through low ex ante real interest rates, is for the central bank to be perceived to be credible in its anti-inflationary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The traditional analytical framework based on the Phillips curve shows that growth can be enhanced not by increasing inflation but by shifting the whole trade-off to more favourable terms by lowering inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.37,0)">How can inflation expectations be lowered?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">By giving the central bank a clear objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Recent experience shows that interest rates can be at low levels in the euro area only because the ECB is perceived by the markets to be fully committed to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.63,0)">The third point is that the existence of a dual mandate is likely to reduce the transparency of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.87,0)">In particular, any central bank with a dual mandate would have difficulties in clearly specifying the objective for price stability, in quantitative terms, without also having to specify an objective for employment or growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.56,0)">However, defining ex ante a plausible combination of quantified objectives represents an impossible task, given that so many factors other than monetary policy can affect inflation and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.48,0)">If the central bank achieved one goal, but not the other, it would easily be subject ex post to criticism for having favoured one objective at the expense of the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">This is the reason why central banks with dual mandates tend not to specify, in a clear and understandable manner for the public at large, the quantitative definition of price stability for which it is accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">The fourth, and related point, is that a dual mandate cannot be easily reconcilable with the independence of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">A central bank with a dual mandate would have to constantly choose ex ante between growth and price stability, assuming – again – that there was such a choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.25,0)">If the central bank was indeed led to make such a choice, it would immediately be subject to the criticism that in modern democracies only elected representatives are allowed to choose between alternative objectives that affect the well-being of citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.35,0)">Specific policies can be delegated to independent non-elected institutions only to the extent that the latter have a very precise mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.59,0)">If the ECB did not have a very precise mandate, and was able to choose between two different and contrasting objectives, some would claim that it should be subjected to political guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.5,0)">In fact, one could suspect that the request to provide the ECB with a dual mandate is ultimately motivated by the wish to reduce the independence of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.8,0)">The analogy with the Federal Reserve System, which is often mentioned by the proponents of the dual mandate, is not relevant and is misleading for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.19,0)">First, the statutes of the Federal Reserve System date back to the end of the 1970s and have not been modified since to take into account developments in the literature on rational expectations and the time inconsistency of optimal monetary policy, which are at the basis of modern central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">On the other hand, even with a dual mandate, the Federal Reserve System constantly reminds market participants, the public at large and the political authorities that its objectives are price stability and growth and employment, “in that order”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In all their speeches, Federal Reserve System Chairmen, lately Alan Greenspan and Ben S. Bernanke, have reiterated that the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable growth is to ensure price stability in a credible manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The latest discussions in the US Congress seem to confirm that the dual mandate might indeed be an obstacle for making the definition of the objective of price stability more explicit, as would be desirable from the point of view of the central bank’s accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Finally, there is now research that shows that in the recent cycle, controlling for the differences in economic structures and the nature of macroeconomic shocks between the United States and the euro area, the policy enacted by the Federal Reserve System has not been more supportive of economic activity than that of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">To sum up, the governance of the euro area with respect to the ECB, its monetary policy and its objective of price stability have been clearly agreed in 1992 and ratified by all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">It has become state of the art in industrial countries and is fully consistent with mainstream economic literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The bottom line is that there is no need to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">Interactions between macroeconomic policies I will not comment extensively on the two other policies, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">budgetary and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">According to the Treaty, these are the competence of national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.76,0)">There is nevertheless an issue of interaction among the various policies and policy actors, given that these policies might affect not only the objective that they target primarily but also the other objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The interaction takes place at two levels: i) at the European level, among the various European institutions; and ii) between the European and the national levels, for a given policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At the European level, the interaction between the authorities in charge of monetary, budgetary and structural policies is well codified in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This is also consistent with the mainstream literature and with the experience in most industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The main goal of the interaction is neither to blur responsibilities nor to make pre-commitments between independent institutions but to ensure an appropriate exchange of information so that each policy can be conducted on the basis of the best possible knowledge of the economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">The exchange of information between the ECB and the finance ministries takes place in various fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.05,0)">Every month the ECB President attends the Eurogroup meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">These meetings are prepared by the Euro Working Group, which comprises the deputies of the euro area finance ministers and ECB representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">Furthermore, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs are invited to attend each meeting of the ECB Governing Council, which takes place every fortnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">This allows both of them to be at the core of monetary policy-making, obviously without the right to vote, and to benefit from all the discussions leading to the final decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This arrangement is without analogy in other industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Any meeting between the ECB and the Eurogroup can be held at any time, if needed, to discuss issues of relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The dialogue between the various European institutions takes place with due regard to the independence of each and works appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There appears to be no need to formalise in any bureaucratic way the format of the dialogue beyond what is already provided for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The second type of policy interaction is between the European and national levels, in particular in the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Budgetary policies are conducted at the national level, in the context of the coordination process provided by the Stability and Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">One question to be asked is whether such policy cooperation is effective and efficient in achieving the desired objectives, such as income stabilisation and sustainable long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.84,0)">I will not address this issue today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.0,0)">I would just note that some people have expressed disappointment at the way in which the Eurogroup has been able to exercise its prerogatives in the budgetary field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Some progress has been achieved over the years in terms of improving the functioning of the Eurogroup, for instance by lengthening the term of its presidency from six months to two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The call for creating some sort of European economic government is frequently proposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">However, these calls have never really been substantiated with concrete proposals, aimed at effectively improving the conduct of national budgetary policies and at implementing a coordinated policy action at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I recently made some proposals, related in particular to the way in which budgetary policies are prepared in the Member States, with a view to taking better into account the European dimension and the interaction with budgetary policies conducted in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.17,0)">The problem is that the Member States, including those that have been calling for a strengthening of the Eurogroup, have resisted adapting even their national budgetary procedures to the European context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Overall, there does not seem to be any desire within national or European policy circles to shift decision-making powers from the former to the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.69,0)">Incidentally, the prevailing economic literature does not support such a move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.96,0)">In this context, the suspicion may arise that the call for such a government is motivated mainly by the attempt to exert influence on the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A final word on international economic policies and cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this field the euro area member countries continue to exercise their national sovereignty separately, in the IMF, the G7 and other fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Some coordination takes place to try to achieve common positions, but the degree of success is unequal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Although the current situation is quite inefficient and does not allow for synergies to be maximised, there is still strong resistance within some policy circles to a more unified and consistent approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.14,0)">This is why, in my personal view, the euro area has a political role that does not match its potential, in light of its population of over 310 million and a GDP comparable with that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Exchange rate policy The governance of the euro area on exchange rate policy is specified in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The choice of exchange rate regime is made by the EU Council of Ministers, after consulting the ECB in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It was decided at the start of EMU that the exchange rate regime of the euro would be a purely floating regime, similar to that in other major industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.03,0)">In the current regime, the responsibility for conducting foreign exchange interventions is exclusively the competence of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The EU Council, acting by qualified majority, can formulate general orientations for exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It can only do this on a recommendation by the European Commission or the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These orientations cannot be in contradiction with the ECB’s primary objective of promoting price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">No general orientation has been given thus far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Arrangements in the euro area differ somewhat from those in other major countries, such as the United States and Japan, where the responsibility for foreign exchange policy, including interventions, is within the competence of finance ministries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">However, experience has shown that the euro area arrangements are fairly balanced and are consistent with the way in which financial markets work in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Indeed, the involvement of the central bank, and consistency with monetary policy, is essential for the effective implementation of any foreign exchange policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.31,0)">In addition, any foreign exchange policy, including intervention in the foreign exchange markets, is likely to be ineffective unless it is agreed with the other major partners, in particular the G7.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">In the euro area, the decision concerning foreign exchange interventions remains exclusively with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There is a strong interaction with the Eurogroup, with a view to achieve a common position with the other main partners, in particular the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The euro area has always acted united in the relevant fora, such as the G7, where common positions on exchange rate issues are achieved and expressed in public, in particular through the G7 communiqués.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">From this point of view, the present arrangements are working properly, and even better than in some other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To be effective, policy messages on exchange rates have to be consistent, within institutions, between institutions and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is the main reason for having G7 communiqués, so that they can be used consistently by all G7 members for consistent public communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For the euro area this would imply that public communication on exchange rate issues should be conducted mainly by the President of the ECB and the President of the Eurogroup, consistent with the practice of the other main partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The members of the Eurogroup should thus align their communication to the message agreed between the ECB and the Eurogroup Presidency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.61,0)">When euro area finance ministers express themselves on exchange rate issues in terms that differ from each other and from the agreed euro area and G7 positions, the most likely outcome on financial markets is the opposite of that intended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.66,0)">Indeed, market participants interpret differences in words as potential disagreements between policy-makers and tend to push rates in the opposite direction to that desired by the authority making the statement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.84,0)">This confusion also undermines the authority of the President of the Eurogroup to speak on behalf of the euro area finance ministers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Overall, although the current arrangements on the exchange rate policy of the euro area are well designed, they probably need to be better implemented, in particular to achieve more stringent verbal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, there is a clear framework for the economic governance of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is fully implemented as far as monetary policy and the coordination between the ECB and the Eurogroup is concerned, in particular with respect to exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There is certainly room for improvement in several areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The first is the coordination, within the Eurogroup, of budgetary policy, to improve the conduct of national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The second is the external representation of the euro area, in particular in international financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In the case of Canada, Israel and New Zealand, the adoption of an inflation targeting scheme was agreed on slightly earlier than the signing of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In fact the Federal Reserve System has a triple mandate, as it has to ensure low long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.76,0)">As FOMC member Anthony M. Santomero was quoted as saying in the Financial Times of 30 September 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The Coordination of Macroeconomic Policies in Europe”, Aspen European Dialogue, February.</span>
