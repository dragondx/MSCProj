    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)"> How can we increase growth potential in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBSuomi Areena 2007Pori, 20 July 2007 Dear Governor Liikanen, I would first like to thank you very warmly for inviting me on the occasion of the “Suomi Areena 2007” event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It is a pleasure and a honour to be here today and to share with you my views on “How can we increase growth potential in Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.64,0)">In light of the partly disappointing euro area economic performance in the past, it is a major policy issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">By contrast, the impressive performance of the Finnish economy, with output and productivity growth over the second half of the 1990s among the highest in the European countries,  , offers a good illustration of what could be done to increase growth potential in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The transformation of the Finnish economy over the last decades represents one of the examples of the “knowledge based-economy” taking hold in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Against this background, I will first review the past economic growth performance of the euro area in comparison to the US and focus on some of the underlying factors of potential output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Then I will elaborate on the reforms which I consider essential to increase the potential growth rate of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The economic performance of the euro area since the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Since 1996, the annual growth rate for the euro area has averaged 2.1% per year compared to 3.3% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.51,0)">What are the fundamental causes of this unsatisfactory low trend growth in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The answers can be found by looking at the factors that determine potential or long-term economic growth, namely  : The degree of labour utilisation, Productivity growth, And the demographic trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">- Over the period 1996-2006, the euro area witnessed a slight improvement in the utilisation of labour, which increased on average by 0.4% per year   when defined as the total annual hours worked divided by the total population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Labour utilisation reflects the extent to which the potential labour resources in an economy are actually utilised and therefore have a direct influence on output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This improvement in labour utilisation mainly reflects the significant rise in the euro area overall employment rate from 58% in 1996 to 64.4% in 2006, accompanied by a decline in the aggregate unemployment rate from 10.7% to 7.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.05,0)">Although this is a very encouraging fact, which shows that the positive employment effect we witnessed over the last ten years has significantly helped us to partly counteract the growth differential to the US, one has to remain aware of the inferior starting position of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.15,0)">Despite the important progress recorded, the overall employment rate in the euro area remains low by international standards   and the unemployment rate is still clearly too high  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.99,0)">It has to be noted that in 2006 the estimated number of annual hours worked in the euro area was 1604 compared to 1804   in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.72,0)">Moreover, while the prime-age male employment rate in the euro area is comparable to that observed in the United States, the disparities remain important when we look at the youth, female and older worker employment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.94,0)">In 2006 the female employment rate was 56.5% in the euro area and 66% in the US, the older workers employment rate was 41.7% in the euro area and 61.8% in the US, and youth employment was 37.1% in the euro area and 54.2% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.3,0)">These features appear to be consistent with an “insider-outsider” characterisation of the European labour market, where structural impediments prevent those groups “at the margin” from participating in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The performance of the labour market in Finland has also been quite impressive these last years with the overall employment rate increasing from 62.4% in 1996 to 69.3% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.29,0)">However, some problems remain with regard to the institutional settings of the labour market, which may have to some extent inhibited the full realisation of employment gains from greater competition and innovation as illustrated by the still relatively high unemployment rate 7.7% in 2006  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">All in all, the rise in employment did not cancel out structural weaknesses of labour markets and there is still considerable room to increase the level of labour resource utilisation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">- Productivity is the other major factor determining growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.12,0)">Over the last decade, the diverging trend in hourly labour productivity growth has been the main reason explaining the growth differential between the euro area and the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">During the 1980’s and the first half of the 1990s, hourly labour productivity in the euro area grew on average by 2.4%, then it decelerated to 1.3% between 1996 and 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">By contrast, US hourly labour productivity growth rose from 1.3% to 2.1% over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">At the sectoral level, the gap in labour productivity growth between the euro area and the US has been mainly driven by some market service sectors intensively using Information and Communication Technologies   namely the wholesale and retail trade sectors as well as the financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.11,0)">In contrast to the US, in these two sectors, labour productivity growth significantly decelerated in the euro area over the last 15 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In the wholesale and retail trade sectors, hourly labour productivity significantly accelerated in the US from 0.7% to 2.6% over the periods 1980-1995 and 1996-2004, while at the same time it decelerated in the euro area from 2.3% to 1.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the financial sectors, over the same periods, hourly labour productivity growth has also accelerated in the US and has been roughly 4 times higher than the growth rate observed in the euro area over the period 1996-2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.12,0)">Several causes have been mentioned to explain this downward trend in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.82,0)">Specific policies aiming at increasing employment particularly in the unskilled segment of the labour market may have contributed to the observed slowdown in labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.81,0)">However, this apparent trade-off between labour utilisation and productivity is likely to be a temporary phenomenon that should progressively fade, when the economy reaches a higher “equilibrium” labour/output ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">There is another major reason that explains the big difference in the rate of labour productivity growth in Europe compared with the US, which in my view is a major policy issue, namely the fact that the European economy, being more inflexible, does not fully take advantage of all the opportunities offered by new technologies, including ICT, and by the new division of labour initiated by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">Restructuring of the productive sector and re-engineering of the production processes appear to be more difficult in a less flexible economy like the European one, implying a negative influence on productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The structural characteristics of the US economy – a more flexible labour market, a higher degree of competition in product markets and lower barriers to entry for new firms – were more conducive to exploiting the opportunities provided by new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It remains relatively easy to understand that the absence of sufficient flexibility in Europe and in the Euro area has not permitted us to take advantage of the new opportunities that were offered and therefore that Europe has not benefited from an increase in labour productivity   like the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.2,0)">What remains hard to explain, is that not only labour productivity growth in Europe did not accelerate but that it slowed down significantly, by more than what would be accounted for by increasing employment in the unskilled segment of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.86,0)">A conjecture that seems to me important to test is whether in periods of very rapid technological and structural transformations not only less flexible economies are not taking advantage of the situation but they might paradoxically behave less properly than in more “normal” times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.47,0)">That could be due to the fact that the degree of rigidity of the economy would augment in practice under the economic “stress” of the much more rapid changes of their environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.73,0)">The fact that total factor productivity, which is one of the proxies for the pace of structural transformation over years has dropped from 0.7% before 1995 down to 0.3%   after 1995 seems to give some credit to this conjecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">- Finally, let us not forget the demographic change occurring on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.3,0)">Indeed, Europe’s long term growth performance has also been constrained by the low rate of population growth and the ageing of its society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Since the mid 1990’s, population in the euro area has been growing at a yearly rate of just 0.4% compared to 1.1% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.17,0)">However, what is worrisome is that at the same time, the gap in population growth has been even larger with regard to growth in the working age population the working age population grew on average by 0.3% per year in the euro area over the period 1996-2006 compared to 1.4% in the US , which manifests that Europe has a more acute problem of population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.53,0)">The need for further structural reforms in Europe This brief assessment of the underlying causes of Europe’s relatively disappointing longer-term growth performance provides a mixed picture of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The lack of structural reforms is, in my view, a major cause of the difference in the growth potential in Europe compared with the US and with some other advanced industrialized economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The structural reforms identified in the Lisbon agenda have the potential to increase both labour productivity growth and labour utilisation, and therefore the long-term growth potential of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The experience of European countries which have undertaken some courageous and successful reforms show that it pays off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">For instance, since the beginning of the EMU in 1999 the euro area has witnessed an increase of more than 12 million in the number of people employed, while from 1990 to 1998, the number of people employed only increased by around 3 millions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is clear that major structural reforms are not easy to achieve, but pursuing resolutely such reforms is especially needed in the current environment, where the European economy is facing a number of important challenges, including rapid technological change, accelerating globalisation as well as ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.88,0)">According to the European Commission’s and ECB projections, the impact of ageing populations alone could reduce on average potential output growth in Europe by nearly half by 2040, if structural reforms are not carried out  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">There is today a unique opportunity for European governments to take advantage of the present favourable growth developments to push ahead with the structural reforms that have been already agreed upon but are still far from being achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Without aiming to be exhaustive, I should like to highlight some of the key priorities for reform in three main areas, namely: Getting more people into work, Increasing competition, And finally, supporting an innovative environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Getting more people into work First of all, well-functioning labour markets are indispensable in fostering higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The differences in labour market developments, especially with regard to the level of labour utilisation, between the US and Europe has prompted some economists to suggest the existence of a “European model” and a “US model”, related to the trade-off between labour and leisure  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.18,0)">One view is that the lower levels of GDP per capita in Europe reflect a European preference for more leisure time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.05,0)">However, we should bear in mind that lower participation rates are not necessarily associated solely with personal preferences, but are also triggered by the legal and regulatory environment, tax systems and social institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Necessary measures to increase labour utilisation or labour supply include the reform of tax and benefit systems in order to increase incentives to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The use of flexible forms of work such as part-time and temporary work may also provide further working incentives  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">High unemployment rates in the euro area and in particular unacceptable high youth unemployment rates clearly suggest the need to spur not only labour supply but also labour demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">There is a need to reduce labour market rigidities restricting wage differentiation and flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.44,0)">Adjustments should be made to employment legislation where it impedes the hiring of younger and older workers in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For instance, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands – which, by the way, are all three, de jure or de facto for Denmark, in the euro area - have achieved success in reducing unemployment and stimulating job creation, despite significantly different economic conditions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.17,0)">In 2006 the unemployment rate in these countries stood below 4.5%, while their overall employment rate was above or close to the US level, namely 72 %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">To achieve such remarkable success, these countries reformed their tax and benefit systems by reducing for example tax wedges on labour income and by carrying out a stricter enforcement of job search rules and a better surveillance of eligibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">They also increased, when and where needed, the flexibility of their labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Increasing competition What all these countries also have in common is a significant reduction of product market regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This leads to the second prerequisite for higher medium to long-term growth: increasing competition towards establishing efficient and well-functioning product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Most studies point to the potential that improving competition has to increase employment in the medium and long run, and to boost productivity trends by improving production efficiency and by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In the EU, some progress has been made in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For example, several network industries, like telecommunications, are now fully or largely open to competition and the hourly labour productivity in this particular sector significantly accelerated from 4.9% to 8.4% over the periods 1980-1995 and 1996-2004 By comparison in the US, hourly labour productivity grew by 3.4% and 4.4% over the same periods in the telecommunication sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">A lot remains to be done, however: the extension and deepening of the EU internal market remains a priority in particular as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Member States have the primary responsibility for these tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.19,0)">Unfortunately, Member State's implementation record of Internal Market legislation is worsening and the number of Internal Market infringements remains stubbornly high in some European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">Let me also briefly mention labour mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Labour mobility is an essential element of the Internal Market and an important factor of adjustment mechanism in a context of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.81,0)">Evidence however suggests that, overall, cross-border labour mobility is still low in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And we still have formal barriers to labour mobility across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States   All in all, increasing product market competition and labour mobility – at the EU and national level, would enable more efficient production structures associated with a more competitive price setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Following the principle of “an open market economy with free competition” is pivotal to fostering long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me now focus more specifically on the financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Financial integration is indeed of key importance for the ECB, given the relevance for the conduct of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The process of European financial integration is gradually taking place and considerable progress has been made for instance in capital markets and wholesale banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.99,0)">However, the retail banking sector appears not yet to have reached its potential, and competition seems insufficient in this area leaving European consumers unable to take full advantage of the benefits of the EMU and the Single Market  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.38,0)">This seems also to have constrained to some extent the economic performance and the development of these sectors in the euro area as illustrated by their disappointing labour productivity growth performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">More generally speaking, evidence indicates that the reallocation of capital from declining industries to industries with high investment opportunities and high productivity is faster in countries with developed financial markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These findings suggest that countries with more liquid capital markets and a developed banking system are growing faster on average  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Supporting an innovative environment Finally, to fully exploit productivity potential, the labour and product market reforms I just mentioned need to be accompanied by policies that support innovation and technological changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">These include, inter alia, the unlocking of business potential by creating an entrepreneurial-friendly economic environment, measures to support innovation through higher investment in research and development   and policies aimed at improving human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The performance of the Finnish economy illustrates all the benefits arising from developing a “knowledge based-economy” as targeted by the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Finland has been ranked by the World Bank among the top world and European countries regarding the ease of doing business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Moreover, Finland is ahead of most European countries when looking at venture capital and R&D investments as well as educational attainment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">First of all, Europe needs more new and thriving firms willing to reap the benefits of opening markets and to embark on creative or innovative ventures for commercial exploitation on a larger scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.17,0)">It is increasingly new and smaller firms, rather than large ones, that are the major providers of new jobs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The contribution from firm dynamic processes to aggregate labour productivity growth and innovation also plays a major role, in particular in high-tech industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">All in all, an entrepreneurial-friendly economic environment would imply less red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises to help them develop at home and across borders, as well as positive action to ease access to the finance they need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">And Europe is significantly lagging behind in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">For instance, venture capital financing in Europe remains only a fraction of what it is in the US relative to the size of their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, promoting R&D investment is also a major issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">While many Member States expect to increase their R&D spending, Europe will fall short of the 2010 overall EU target of achieving 3% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.34,0)">In 2005 R&D investment relative to GDP was 1.9% in the euro area compared to 2.7% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The efforts of European countries to increase R&D investment are still insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Particular attention should be paid to increase public R&D spending efficiency and more attractive conditions for technology-intensive markets should be created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This includes for instance a better use of public procurement and a more innovation-friendly regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The European Commission estimated that an increase in the share of R&D expenditures in GDP from 1.9% in 2004 to 3% by 2010 would result in an increase of 1.7% in the level of GDP by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It goes without saying that it is not only a quantitative issue and that at the same time the efficiency of research and development in terms of industrialisation is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the longer term, GDP could be up by 4.2% in 2015 and 7.0% in 2020, equivalent to an additional growth rate of nearly 0.5% per year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Finally, to make these measures most effective, they need to be accompanied by efforts to improve the labour force’s level of education and expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Meeting the challenges of innovation and its diffusion as well as ensuring the labour force’s employability and flexibility, requires that human capital is continuously adjusted to labour market needs through improved education and training, as well as lifelong learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The last decades have already brought about an enormous increase in the level of educational attainment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.33,0)">However, so far investment in human capital in Europe is still clearly inadequate for a “knowledge-intensive” economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">In 2003, the US annual expenditure on higher education institutions represented 2.9% of GDP, while in the euro area it only represented 1.2%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The gap is mainly a result of greater private funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">European universities should be allowed and encouraged for instance to seek complementary private sources of funding and legal, and other barriers to public-private partnerships between universities and businesses should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A better and more effective education system, as estimated by some research of the European Commission, might add as much as 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points to the annual EU GDP growth rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Macroeconomic stability to support higher and sustainable growth As mentioned earlier, the supply-side determinants of long-term growth that I have emphasised should not be understood as an exhaustive explanation for the growth performance of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">We should also look beyond the microeconomics of the supply-side and ensure an appropriate macroeconomic framework in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First of all, sound national fiscal policies in Europe are of the essence because they ultimately are supporting growth and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Prudent fiscal policies for instance contribute to lower risk premia on long-term interest rates and thus to more favourable financing conditions, which in turn promotes investment and long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">It is important that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation in economic “good times” and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments they made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Beyond that, the “quality” of public finances also matters for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">It is essential to increase public spending efficiency in order to facilitate the reorientation of public expenditure towards productivity-enhancing physical and human capital accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB therefore welcomes the emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Monetary policy plays a key role in fostering sustainable economic growth in Europe through maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.7,0)">A central bank must avoid the negative effects of the uncertainty caused by high inflation on long-term growth as well as the adverse impact of uncertainty due to variable and unanticipated inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.59,0)">Variability of inflation increases uncertainty and exerts a major negative influence on investment and thus on potential output as well as on other components of aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The environment of price stability, the credibility of the ECB in delivering price stability over time and therefore the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, are paving the way for sustainable economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusions Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by stressing a few points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Monetary Union has been effective – and very successful – in supporting growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In 2006, real GDP in the euro area grew by 2.9%, which is the highest rate since 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This positive development is very encouraging, but this is no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Europe still has some way to go to fully benefit from globalization and meet the challenges of rapid technological changes and ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We should also keep in mind that in a context of monetary union, not only fiscal policies, but also price competitiveness and unit labour cost developments across countries should be continuously and closely
