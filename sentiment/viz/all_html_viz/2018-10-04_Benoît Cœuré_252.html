    <span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)"> The local impact of the ECB’s monetary policy Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Les Champs du Possible, Châteaudun, 4 October 2018 Presentation slides It is a great pleasure to be here in Châteaudun and have the opportunity to exchange views with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The ECB Governing Council, which sets monetary policy for the euro area, benefits from such dialogue in two very important ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The first is that it enriches our understanding of the state and the drivers of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with local high school students.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I also visited a company that exports its products to Europe and the wider world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.19,0)">In a currency union with 19 countries, policymakers are always at risk of focusing too much on the big picture and overlooking local reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The second benefit is that such visits to local communities enable us to explain our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We are accountable to the 340 million people living in the euro area, so we have a responsibility to clarify what we do and why we think our actions are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">So that is what I would like to do in the next 15 minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In particular, I would like to talk about the role of the ECB’s monetary policy in the current economic expansion and describe how it has helped to foster employment and growth in the euro area as a whole, and also here in Eure-et-Loir.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And, perhaps even more importantly, I will also set out what monetary policy cannot do, and how sustainable growth crucially depends on growth and job policies decided at regional, national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ECB’s response to financial fragmentation Let me start with an overview of the situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As you can see on my first slide, the euro area economy has now enjoyed five years of uninterrupted growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Gross domestic product – the blue line – is well above the levels we observed before the great financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The labour market has also improved notably in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Employment – the yellow line – has risen by 9.2 million since mid-2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.29,0)">The unemployment rate fell to 8.1% in August 2018, its lowest level in ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The participation rate of people aged between 15 and 74 now stands at 64%, 1.5 percentage point higher than ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.61,0)">By comparison, in the United States the participation ratio of those aged 16 and over decreased from 66% in 2008 to 63% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">With stronger growth and rising employment, we also see a gradual build-up in price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">On the right-hand side you can see that, after a long period of quiescence, wages, here measured as compensation per employee, have finally started to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">And as they are growing faster than the rate of inflation, many people are seeing their real incomes rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This can only be good news for businesses’ order books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">So, overall, it is fair to say that the euro area economy is in the best shape it has been in for many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.76,0)">Yet we are well aware that there might be a discrepancy, or disconnect, between the macroeconomic data that the ECB primarily relies on – and that we use in communicating and justifying our decisions – and what people can see around them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">For example, although in the euro area as a whole the recent rise in employment more than compensated for the decline since the crisis, the unemployment rate here in Centre-Val de Loire increased from 5.5% in 2008 to 8.6% last year according to Eurostat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Before the outbreak of the crisis, the unemployment rate in this region was lower than in the median euro area region; today it is higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me reassure you that such differences across regions, or across countries, do not go unnoticed in the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We are keeping a close eye on regional developments and carefully investigate the possible causes of persistent differences in growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.57,0)">After all, a permanent divergence of the regions or countries in a currency union would make it increasingly difficult to define and implement a common monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.6,0)">There are instances where monetary policy can do very little about regional differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">I will turn to these in a minute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">But there are also circumstances where central banks can and should help reduce perilous disparities, in particular when they threaten the effectiveness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Our experience since 2014 illustrates this aspect well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.85,0)">Around that time, we faced a dangerous disparity in firms’ access to credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this more clearly on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What you can see here are the responses to the ECB’s survey on the access to finance of enterprises, which is mainly targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises   and conducted jointly with the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.4,0)">Specifically, the chart shows the responses of firms across broad European regions to the question: “Would you say that the availability of bank loans has improved, remained unchanged or deteriorated for your enterprise over the past six months?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.9,0)">Yellow areas indicate that firms see a deterioration in availability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.6,0)">Clearly, in 2014 there were many regions in the euro area where SMEs – the backbone of our economy – reported restricted access to credit, including here in what statisticians refer to as the Paris Basin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.53,0)">As influencing the cost of credit is an essential part of what central banks do, the restricted access to credit experienced by enterprises meant that our monetary policy could not fully unfold its potential in these regions, a situation that, in turn, threatened investment and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.24,0)">Our standard monetary policy instrument – the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds overnight – was not suited for addressing such fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">We therefore adopted, from mid-2014 onwards, a range of measures that would ensure that banks could more easily extend credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In a nutshell, we allowed banks to borrow funds from the ECB over much longer horizons – of up to four years – and at very attractive rates, on the condition that they would increase their lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We did this through what we call “targeted longer-term refinancing operations”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And the collateral pledged by banks when borrowing from the ECB   can include credit claims, including loans to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We also took two other policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The first was our decision to purchase securities on financial markets, a move known as “quantitative easing” in the parlance of economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As at the end of September 2018, we had purchased €2,076 billion of public sector bonds, €259 billion of covered bonds, €170 billion of corporate bonds and €27 billion of asset-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">How do such purchases benefit the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The underlying mechanism is, in fact, very simple and powerful: by purchasing government bonds in particular we compress the return that banks and other investors can expect from holding a riskless financial asset, thereby making it more attractive for them to extend credit or provide capital to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.56,0)">Our second decision was to impose negative interest rates, namely an annualised interest rate of -0.4% on banks’ overnight deposits at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.69,0)">Here, we face considerable scepticism from the general public as people feel they are being deprived of their “right” to earn positive interest on savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.24,0)">But one often forgets two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.02,0)">First, negative rates barely apply to firms, and even less so to households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.99,0)">They are, by and large, levied on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.85,0)">And, second, charging banks to leave their funds overnight at the ECB has created a “hot potato” effect: it discourages banks from hoarding cash and gives them an incentive to extend credit to firms and households instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">You can see the success of our measures on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.26,0)">Today, credit is no longer an impediment to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Virtually all euro area regions now report improvements in the availability of bank loans, also here in Paris Basin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">In other words, our measures have visibly reduced fragmentation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">You can see this also on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.48,0)">While in 2014 firms in Italy and Spain faced much higher borrowing rates than in Germany or France, today this gap has vanished, by and large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">Firms are no longer penalised by their location within our currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.06,0)">And those that already benefited from low interest rates a few years ago today enjoy the lowest borrowing conditions on record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Never has it been cheaper for you – for firms – to borrow from banks than it is today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.3,0)">In France, for example, the composite cost of borrowing for firms during the first half of this year was just 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of course, that is not to say that all of you will always obtain credit from your bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Assessing credit risk remains a key function of banks, and the relationship is a commercial one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But all other things being equal, credit has become easier and cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">And firms have responded to the marked easing in borrowing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">You can see this on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Thanks to the impact of our policy measures on borrowing rates, annual loan growth to firms has accelerated measurably in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">As a result, corporate investment is currently growing at an annual rate of well above 3% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In France, loans have increased to such an extent that the Haut Conseil de stabilité financière decided that, from 1 July 2019, banks will have to put aside more capital against possible future risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Making our economies work better So, the ECB’s monetary policy has played a crucial role in promoting investment, consumption and, ultimately, price stability by reducing the borrowing rates faced by the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It is therefore fair to say that many of the jobs created over the past few years can be partly attributed to the success of ECB policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, while a stability-oriented monetary policy is a necessary condition for sustainable growth, it is not enough on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.75,0)">Many of the remaining regional disparities reflect factors other than monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.65,0)">For example, my next slide shows that despite favourable financing conditions, in recent years growth and job creation here in Centre-Val de Loire have been lagging behind developments in many other euro area regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">To some extent, the gap has even been widening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.97,0)">Such disparities often result from differences in labour market practices, product market regulations or, more generally, the ease of doing business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.16,0)">And, indeed, euro area countries still differ widely in many aspects of their economic and financial structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Such differences are of course not a bad thing per se; they reflect national preferences, cultures and histories that should be preserved and cultivated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Europe does not impose a one-size-fits-all development model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But there is a clear relationship between the quality of institutions and economic prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">As shown by the left-hand chart, the better the overall quality of their economic institutions, the richer countries tend to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">France is a case in point, as you can see on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.08,0)">In the ECB survey on access to finance which I referred to earlier, firms were also asked which factors they consider as the greatest impediments to their business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.4,0)">Clearly, many SMEs consider regulation as the most pressing problem in France, and noticeably more share that view here in the Paris Basin than in many other euro area regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For this reason, reforming economies, reducing red tape and improving the business environment can help to promote stronger and more sustainable growth in all regions of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Again, this is not about all countries adopting a single model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">It is about each Member State adopting a model that delivers the right outcomes while allowing them to find and exploit their comparative advantages in the Single Market and in Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The European Union actively supports governments in their efforts to allow productive firms to thrive, also here in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">For example, the region of Centre-Val de Loire can draw on EU funds worth about €600 million via the European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2014-20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">These funds aim, among other things, to boost job creation in SMEs, facilitate climate change adaptation, including the transition towards a low-carbon economy, and to support training initiatives for the younger generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.43,0)">With the help of this programme, more than 1,500 unemployed young people, who here in the Centre region have lower qualifications than the national average, could already return to education, gain a qualification or are now in employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The European Investment Bank is active in this region too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Since 2011, it has provided financing of about €1.5 billion for projects in Centre-Val de Loire, including the modernisation of high schools and the construction, operation and maintenance of a new section of the high-speed railway between Tours and Bordeaux.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Conclusion All of this means, and with this I would like to conclude, that if we all work together as a team within our respective mandates – local, regional and central governments as well as European institutions – we can create and nurture the conditions needed for small firms to compete in the global market and thereby provide jobs, safety and prosperity for their local communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">For its part, the ECB will continue to support the stability of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Our actions over the past few years have decisively contributed to reducing financial fragmentation across euro area borders and I am convinced that they have played a crucial role in supporting growth, employment and stable prices.</span>
