    <h2> Remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 17th Annual International Banking Conference, Policy panel: Where to from here? Chicago, 7 November 2014 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.76,0)"> Where to from here?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 17th Annual International Banking Conference, Policy panel: Where to from here?Chicago, 7 November 2014 Seven years after the beginning of the crisis, much has been achieved to improve the regulatory framework of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">After the scare of a possible financial meltdown, authorities around the world wanted a simpler system that would be less leveraged, more resilient, transparent and efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.71,0)">Nevertheless, several measures are not finalised, implementation of others has been slow and some others will enter into force only in a few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Referring to the title of this panel “Where to from here?”, I would say that we are not yet “here”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my remarks, I will start by highlighting some of the achievements and then move on to comment on what, in my view, is still missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In broad terms, the first area where major improvements were achieved concerns capital and liquidity regulation: the increase in capital requirements, the introduction of a   leverage ratio and the introduction of the two liquidity ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.75,0)">These apply to the regulated part of the system, mostly banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the US, the banking sector increased by the consolidation or transformation of major broker-dealers into banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.58,0)">This was not the case for the European banking sector, which actually shrank in the aftermath of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It became apparent that what had emerged in the run-up to the crisis was a new market-based credit system funded by short-term secured transactions, protected by risk transfer operations in the OTC derivatives market  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">This new system had split traditional credit intermediation into separate transactions and was not captured by the statistical system, be it flow of funds accounts or monetary statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.62,0)">It was indeed a “shadow banking” sector that was not fully on the radar of regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As a result, “shadow banking” is a second area where important measures have been taken and a number of others are under way for adoption in the course of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Securitisation, repos and OTC derivatives operationally underpin the development of this new credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Securitisation standards have been improved by the application of new regulations and the market has abandoned many unsound practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The definition of standards for high-quality securitisations has continued and a revision of capital charges is being prepared to re-launch the market on a healthier basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some measures are still to be completed, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">on shadow banking or OTC derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.42,0)">The implementation of several others has either been delayed or will take some time to be finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Regarding the repo and securities lending markets, a major step forward was the Financial Stability Board’s   recent publication of rules for the introduction of minimum haircuts on transactions basically involving corporate securities that are not centrally cleared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This workstream will be concluded early next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Concerning institutions belonging to the “shadow banking” sector, new recommendations were issued by IOSCO and, in 2015, an assessment will be made of the implementation of new regulations in different jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.4,0)">Progress has been uneven and in several cases insufficient, in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.0,0)">Other types of institution will also be reviewed next year by the FSB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Still in the field of “shadow banking”, regarding the OTC derivatives markets, efforts have been concentrated on transferring the settlement of transactions to central clearing institutions and on stimulating the use of trade repositories to gather and disseminate post-trade information on the transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">However, implementation was not made mandatory in many cases and implementation of the new standards is well behind schedule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.06,0)">The announced transfer of standardised transactions to organised multilateral platforms is even more delayed as only three jurisdictions have introduced trading transfer requirements for a limited type of derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A third domain of regulatory reform concerns the overcoming of the “too-big-to-fail” problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Significant steps forward have been: the increase in capital reinforced by the G-SIB surcharge; the harmonisation of key attributes for resolution already legislated in many jurisdictions; the formalisation of resolution plans that have to be approved by the authorities; the forthcoming introduction of a total loss-absorbing capacity   that includes equity and a layer of “bail-in-able debt”; and finally, the adherence of all the major players in the derivatives market to a new ISDA agreement to forgo the termination of cross-border contracts in the event of a globally systemic bank entering resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This was the maximum that could be achieved to address the risks of ring-fencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.46,0)">But many other aspects will have to remain open, since the harmonisation of national bankruptcy laws is admittedly unrealistic in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The success of the new approach in moving from a culture of bail-outs to a culture of private bail-in depends also on the credibility of the implementation in the eyes of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.0,0)">Another word of caution against over optimism refers to the possibility that problems may not only relate to one institution being “too-big-to-fail” but also possible instances where there are to “too-many-to-fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Another important change in the framework to deal with systemic risk has been the establishment of macro-prudential authorities endowed with a set of instruments to counter risks of financial imbalances, triggering asset price boom/bust cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The range of views about what has been achieved is broad: some say that we are close to overregulation, while others will maintain that nothing fundamental has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.83,0)">They are both wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.34,0)">It has to be acknowledged that there are important delays in the implementation of some measures, while several others are not yet finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is particularly true of “shadow banking” entities and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The recent evolution of the financial system confirms that after an initial decline after 2008, the expanding role of the market-based credit system called “shadow banking” is progressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.62,0)">In Europe, the banking sector’s total assets have decreased by 11% since 2012, whereas the total assets of investment funds have increased by 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A broad concept of “shadow banking” now represents 63% of bank assets in the euro area and more than 100% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Entities like special investment vehicles   or conduits have receded while new forms of funds have flourished, such as: REITs, ETFs, leveraged loans, some CDO structures, and “covenant-lite” loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This brings me to the core part of my intervention: what, in my view, is still missing or “Where to from here?” for financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will concentrate on five key points: “shadow banking”; OTC derivatives; liquidity mismatches; the macro-prudential toolkit; and incentives in financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.49,0)">Shadow banking The first point to consider concerns the insufficient information about the new market-based credit system I just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These are non-bank institutions that, in a broad sense, perform credit intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is not bad per se, but the transfer of activity to the “shadow banking” sector entails new risks that are not being monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.83,0)">Therefore, it is unclear whether the impact on the overall risk of the system is positive or negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Even if overall leverage can become less of an issue, liquidity risks stemming from the maturity transformation may considerably increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Take the case of investment funds, the overwhelming majority of which is of the open-ended type.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As investors incur possible losses, there are as such no issues with excessive leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.84,0)">There is, however, a significant question of liquidity risk as investment funds’ units are redeemable in the short term and their assets have much longer maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.26,0)">The same applies to money-market funds or ETFs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Redemption risk has to be better addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">“Shadow banking” is more than just non-bank entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.08,0)">Shadow banking activities encompass activities often carried out by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">These include repos and securities financing transactions and the use of different types of derivative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Part of these activities is not covered by existing statistics, justifying the designation of “shadow banking”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.65,0)">Flow-of-funds accounts record exposures but not the risk transfer generated by derivatives and become therefore misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.63,0)">At the same time, forms of quasi-money, such as secured short-term instruments that now represent and act as money in the “shadow banking” sector, are not included in monetary statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">We need to create a new statistical apparatus and extend our knowledge of this new sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A second point: I would highlight the management of the boundary problems between regulated and less regulated sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Even before the crisis, the general mantra was that non-banks did not require any regulation because it was enough, from the regulated side, to supervise banks’ exposures to non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">This was not effectively done before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.6,0)">And at present, the two Basel decisions, namely on the equity investments of banks in non-bank financial institutions and on the limits to large credit exposures of banks, still do not fully acknowledge the existence of “shadow banking”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">Large exposure limits relate to exposures to individual clients and not to any particular sector, notably the shadow banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">The Dodd-Frank Act however imposes specific quantitative limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Furthermore, the FSOC in the US has the competence, which has already been activated, to declare any institution as financially systemic and therefore subject to close surveillance by the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This is a powerful tool to apply to the regulated side, light- or non-regulated entities, which does not exist in other jurisdictions, notably in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In my view, the question of managing the boundary problems has to be appropriately addressed through financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The third point I want to make concerns the regulation of money market funds  , an important component of the “shadow banking” sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Some recommendations on MMFs have been issued by international bodies, particularly IOSCO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.82,0)">There is however still no clarity about what to do in terms of international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the US, the approach taken was to move to variable net asset value   MMFs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.03,0)">In my view this is an inadequate solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">If Gary Gorton is right in his recent book  , variable NAVs can more easily trigger runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.19,0)">David Scharfstein has also criticised this approach, which I hope will not be followed in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The fourth aspect relates to the repo market, which is an essential component of the new market-based credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">A change in the bankruptcy laws exempting repos from automatic stays in default cases   triggered the large increase in the repo market’s size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.95,0)">The regulation of minimum haircuts on such transactions when not centrally cleared addresses an important issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The issue of re-hypothecation and re-use of securities in securities financing and repos that create chains of inside   liquidity and facilitate rises in leverage is also being examined by a new FSB workstream.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.23,0)">Such inside liquidity creates an illusion of liquidity that disappears in stressed times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.11,0)">The excessive reliance on repos and the subsequent “run on repo” were important aspects of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Limitations to re-hypothecation were introduced in the US to respond to this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This has however not been done in other jurisdictions, notably Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">It is expected that the FSB work under way will come up with appropriate recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">OTC derivatives OTC derivatives play an important role in the new credit system by helping to create “relatively safe” assets by transferring or hedging risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The move to central clearing and to trade repositories, which has been mostly voluntary, has improved transparency and safety in a significant way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The implementation of the intended transfer of transactions to organised markets of sufficiently standardised derivatives however, has been modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.09,0)">Very little has been done outside the US, where only a segment of the interest swap market has been affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Obvious candidates to such transfers to organised markets would be certain types of standardised CDS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">The present market is dominated by half a dozen institutions and what is known about transaction prices is based on quotes provided by the major players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">In 2009, Myron Scholes said in a conference: “We should blow up or burn CDSs   and start all over again”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The move to multilateral organised platforms would provide price transparency, reduce transaction costs and increase competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It should therefore be kept on the regulatory agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Liquidity mismatches An important regulatory change introduced after the crisis was the liquidity regulation with the two new liquidity ratios: the LCR and the NSFR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.27,0)">Both ratios have been watered down since the original proposals, and the LCR, in particular, might have become too lax.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">Another relevant aspect is that both ratios are static in nature and not sufficiently granular to facilitate liquidity stress testing or to constitute an overall measure of an institution’s liquidity position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Brunnermeier et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">have proposed a new liquidity mismatch indicator   that would attribute liquidity weights to the relevant items of assets and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It would provide a sector-wide LMI and enable liquidity stress testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It goes without saying that more information would have to be collected from the banks and non-banks, but that goes along with the necessary enhanced monitoring of liquidity in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Macro-prudential policies The regulatory reform brought to the forefront macro-prudential policy as a set of regulatory instruments focused on the overall situation of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Most of the instruments are of micro-prudential nature, but applied at system-wide level, which lends them a different dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Macro-prudential tools are now part of the ECB’s policy toolkit since it was entrusted with supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The objectives of the new policy include both the improvement of the financial system’s resilience and the smoothing of the financial cycle, as measured by credit and asset prices developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.7,0)">Empirically, it has been demonstrated that the financial cycle is normally longer than the business cycle, which implies that they evolve differently during certain periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Testimony to this is the “Great Moderation” period before the crisis, or the present situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">Monetary policy is directed to deal primarily with the business cycle and thus to variables like inflation and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.26,0)">The general environment of low inflation and low growth which, particularly in Europe, has been recently associated with the hypothesis of secular stagnation, requires an accommodative monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.45,0)">At the same time, the resulting regime of low interest rates may contribute to fostering a search for yield and creating froth in some asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This requires central banks which are entrusted with safeguarding the stability of the financial system to be provided with an effective set of macro-prudential policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB has at its disposal the instruments foreseen in the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.7,0)">These are concentrated on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.74,0)">However, any froth that may exist in some European asset markets is, this time, not fuelled by bank credit, which continues to decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The reduction in bank credit is being offset by the expansion of capital market-based financing or the enhanced role of non-bank institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.68,0)">The ECB does not have macro-prudential instruments to deal with the new market-based credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The incoming review of CRD IV/CRR may offer an opportunity to reinforce the toolkit by including other instruments such as loan-to-value   or debt-to-income   limits, for instance, addressing risks stemming from real estate, or a more extensive use of large exposure regimes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.71,0)">The reality is that without more instruments, including those that the Federal Reserve already has, the ECB can hardly be made fully accountable for financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.55,0)">V. Remuneration incentives in financial institutions The recent distressing revelation of malfeasance in several financial institutions is the most deplorable consequence of the wrong set of incentives that has prevailed in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.23,0)">Already in 2005, Raghuram Rajan in his Jackson Hole paper   pointed to the destabilising role played by the bad incentives that fostered excessive search for yield and leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.3,0)">The aforementioned regulatory changes introduced since 2008 are clearly not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I agree with the New York Fed President’s recent proposals to introduce deferred compensation   in the form of performance bonds subject to bail-in measures in case of the institution having to pay fines for misbehaviour or having to go into resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.63,0)">Addressing an audience of top managers, Dudley ended with a harsh warning in case incentives did not change in financial institutions: “If that were to occur, the inevitable conclusion will be reached that your firms are too big and complex to manage effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.48,0)">In that case, financial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so that they can be managed effectively”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This statement illustrates the multiple dimensions that restoring confidence in finance implies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is not just all about increasing the capital of the institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Many other aspects must still be taken care of if we want to ensure a transparent, trustworthy and efficient financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Gorton, G., 2012, Misunderstanding Financial Crises: Why We Don't    Brunnermeier, Markus, with Gary Gorton and Arvind Krishnamurthy, 2014, Risk Topography: Systemic Risk and Macro Modeling, University of Chicago Press.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Rajan, R., 2005, “Has financial development made the world riskier?”, Jackson Hole paper.</span>
