    <span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)"> Tackling unemployment in Europe – increasing mobility, enhancing flexibility, optimising education Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the University of Luxembourg,Luxembourg, 26 September 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, First of all: congratulations to all doctoral students, whose graduation we are celebrating today!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">I am confident that you have a bright future ahead of you, as you stand well prepared to enter the labour market and to find jobs that match your skills – be it in academia, in the private or public sectors, here in Luxembourg or elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Holding the relevant qualification is a precondition for receiving a suitable job offer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, it might not always be enough to secure a job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.54,0)">In several European countries, prospects are rather dismal, especially for young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.06,0)">I am aware that unemployment may not be the most obvious challenge to talk to you about on such a celebratory occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.66,0)">It is, however, a major concern for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And I am convinced that well-educated people like you can really make a difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.45,0)">High unemployment in the euro area – merely a temporary phenomenon?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.87,0)">Temporary rises in unemployment rates are typical of cyclical downswings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.2,0)">Such cyclical increases in unemployment are distressing for those affected and can have dire consequences, but they tend to reflect a transitory downturn in labour demand and do not necessarily have a strong structural component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.97,0)">Firms that are uncertain about the strength of the recovery are unlikely to invest or to rehire workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.89,0)">At low interest rate levels and high labour market rigidities, firms tend to favour capital intensive investments over hiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.27,0)">Yet, developments during the second recessionary episode in Europe differ from those observed at the beginning of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.16,0)">During the Great Recession, unemployment rose, as there was a shortage of vacancies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">However, during the second recessionary dip, unemployment increased, although aggregate vacancy rates remained close to long-term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.47,0)">In addition, the second recessionary period led not only to extensive, but also to very persistent job losses in some euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The proportion of people in long-term unemployment rose substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.03,0)">This is particularly worrisome, as it reduces the chances that they will be rehired: if workers are unemployed for a long period of time, their skills might simply erode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.31,0)">Long spells of unemployment may thus easily turn into structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.29,0)">Indeed, the mere fact that firms are willing to hire, but people willing to work are unable to find a job is already indicative of structural factors playing a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Estimates suggest that structural unemployment in the euro area, which was already high prior to the crisis, rose by about 17% from 2008 to 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.77,0)">Structural unemployment is not only distressing for those affected, but can have a substantial impact on potential output in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.61,0)">It is essential, therefore, to avoid hysteresis effects from rises in spells of long-term unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">Particularly in countries that were hard hit, a large part of the decline in employment can be attributed to certain sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.03,0)">For instance, in Estonia, Ireland and Spain, the previously oversized construction sectors had to downsize substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.62,0)">The Spanish construction sector alone has accounted for around half of all job losses in the country since the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.94,0)">Moreover, such a collapse in the construction sector has an enormous impact further down the production chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.36,0)">So, the number of people affected – for instance those providing building materials or real estate services – is estimated to be much greater than the 1.8 million who lost jobs in the construction sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.06,0)">The resulting mismatch between the skills offered by unemployed workers and those that employers require explains why vacancies are not filled, despite people being willing to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In fact, skills mismatch has increased noticeably in the euro area and seems to be becoming more entrenched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Potential solutions to increase high qualified employment If labour market developments are so heterogeneous across countries, why don’t the unemployed simply move to places where the demand for labour is higher?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Indeed, labour mobility is a powerful tool for tackling high localised unemployment levels and alleviating emerging bottlenecks in faster-growing euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">That is why labour mobility is a core element of a successful currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">It leads to a better match between workers’ skills and employers’ demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In economic jargon, it aids factor re-allocation by moving labour to where it is needed, which in turn contributes to overall growth in a monetary union and acts as an effective adjustment mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So, how does Europe fare in terms of labour mobility?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The free movement of workers is a fundamental right enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But how much use do citizens make of this right in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Since the enlargement of the European Union   in 2004, labour market mobility has certainly risen, albeit from very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The crisis boosted intra-EU mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Some studies suggest that the migration response to the crisis might have been even stronger in the EU than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This is quite remarkable given that the United States is often taken as a benchmark for mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, it has sizeable macroeconomic effects: estimates suggest that post-enlargement mobility flows over the period 2004-09 increased the GDP of the EU15 by around 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">The impact on the GDP of major destination countries for migration, such as Ireland, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom was even higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Increased labour mobility is certainly good news – both for originating and destination countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Another piece of potentially good news is that the level of education that migrants bring to their destination countries has improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.83,0)">With highly-skilled people willing to move for work, skills shortages in destination countries could be compensated for by workers emigrating from other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At least, this is how it should work ideally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.96,0)">What is worrying, however, is that many intra-EU migrant workers are employed below their skills level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The resulting underutilisation of human capital shows that reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of cross-border mobility in order to fully reap the benefits of workers’ migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.71,0)">One issue is that recognition of qualifications remains uneven across EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.71,0)">According to a recent survey  , current procedures that tend to be cumbersome could easily be replaced by more automatic ones: more than 90% of requests submitted result in the qualifications being recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.99,0)">But even if their qualifications have been recognised, migrants might simply not be able to take up a position matching their level of education owing to lack of language skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">More training in this area would certainly be welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Beyond efforts at Member State level, the reformed European Social Fund could be instrumental in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Among other things, its objectives include investment “in education, skills and lifelong learning”, as well as measures for “promoting employment and supporting labour mobility”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">It is up to the European Commission and the Member States to make the most out of the opportunity for mobility through operational programmes, such as language courses or exchange programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.85,0)">Another barrier to workers moving from one country to another is that they are uncertain as to what will happen if they cannot find employment immediately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">Unemployment benefits are transferable only to a limited extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">EU law has been adjusted accordingly and now needs to be implemented rigorously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The same applies for the transferability of pension rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">To summarise, adjustment through mobility is not merely a theoretical concept, but a European reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">However, there is scope for both more inter-regional and more inter-country labour mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mobility is not the sole answer, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">After all, employment will rise once firms are willing to hire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">And they will do so if conditions are favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">While policy-makers cannot interfere with employers’ decisions, they can certainly provide the right setting and eliminate barriers to more efficient labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Euro area countries simply need to achieve the labour market flexibility that is compatible with membership of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.76,0)">Traditionally, policy-makers have focused on passive labour market policies, such as unemployment benefits that are de-linked from incentives to find a job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">In my view, such policies should be complemented by more active policies, such as job-search assistance and targeted productivity-enhancing training measures to foster employability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To ensure sustainable economic development, reforms are necessary and beneficial for countries that are currently facing high unemployment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.86,0)">Countries with more rapidly ageing populations also need to prepare, as they might soon face bottlenecks in labour supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">Some of these countries are already confronted with skills shortages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.73,0)">Just to give you an example of the implications: according to an OECD survey, potential GDP growth in Germany could decline to below 1% soon after 2020 as a result of an ageing population and skills shortages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Once I met a boy who said that his professional ambition was to become a pensioner like his grandfather.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.09,0)">When I explained that this was related to age, he said that alternatively he would accept to be an unemployment beneficiary like his father.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.91,0)">Sadly, today he is in and out of prison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.0,0)">You see how wrong mind sets on fundamental values like work lead to social disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.86,0)">The same applies to the belief that you must only make an effort once and then live off your diploma for the rest of your life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.69,0)">Technological and demographic changes affect skill renewal and knowledge transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">More frequent skill upgrades in life cycles and better social usage of the swelling so-called non-productive age cohorts are challenges to intergenerational knowledge transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.87,0)">The fraction of the elderly in the population will increase tremendously, while the fraction of those who produce resources is going to decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.44,0)">This overall loss in productivity will also affect capital, rates of return on capital will go down at a moment when pension funds are already stretched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.57,0)">This is known under the catch phrase “asset market meltdown”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.5,0)">Even in Luxembourg, the annual growth rate of GDP per capita, or better per employee, has strongly decreased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The question is, can you mitigate the effects of ageing societies by a rise in human capital?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.64,0)">Research at Goethe University has shown that “the projected fall in the rate of return on capital of 0.8 p.p.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.16,0)">would be just 0.5 p.p.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">in the case of adjustments in human capital through better education.” Life-long learning, therefore also includes making better social use of the old.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A University in an environment of finite financial resources has to address the challenge of including vocational training in its strategic spanning, in order to reap organisational and logistic gains in efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">A better use of facilities, resources and synergies increase financial efficiency and extend the sense of ownership of the University in the population at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Of course, we must not forget the priority task of a University and the principle that quantity cannot replace quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Striving for excellence must remain the guiding principle, especially in a country where the risks of complacency rise by the day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">Conclusion On that note, I shall draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.14,0)">Unemployment in the euro area remains at unacceptably high levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In order to tackle it effectively, we need to embark on a triad of measures: increased mobility, enhanced flexibility and optimal education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">And this is why, at the beginning of my remarks today, I said that well-educated, highly-skilled people like you can make a difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">So, let me conclude by wishing all of you a very successful 2014/2015 academic year!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Thank you to the departing President Rolf Tarrach, and all the best to the incoming President Rainer Klump.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.49,0)">The European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development   and the International Monetary Fund   use different estimation methods, resulting on average in structural unemployment being estimated at 8.8% in 2008 and 10.3% in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ad hoc task force of the
