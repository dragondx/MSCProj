    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Monetary policy in EMU – views and challenges Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBZEW, Mannheim, 24 June 2005 Introduction The subject which the organisers have chosen for this conference, namely “Competition in Europe – Europe facing international competition” is not only very topical, but also very challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">While my presentation today will not focus directly on these issues, I will address them both in my discussion of economic differentials within the euro area and in my concluding remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">My main message today is that Economic and Monetary Union   is beneficial to all of the individual countries which comprise the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I will begin by presenting some key macroeconomic developments which show the great success of the EMU project, not only in terms of price stability and low inflation expectations, but also with respect to the low macroeconomic volatility in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">I will argue that a high degree of credibility, transparency and predictability on the part of monetary policy are key conditions for this success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is not the stability-oriented monetary policy of the ECB alone that has made the success of the euro possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">During the transition to the euro fiscal policies have been more disciplined than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Moreover, some structural reforms have been implemented and social partners have contributed via wage moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.33,0)">One should not overlook these contributions to macroeconomic stability and job creation simply because their positive effects have been diminished by uncertainties and hesitation regarding further reform projects and fiscal policy soundness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Major adverse supply shocks in recent years have also to be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Finally, I will discuss the issue of inflation and growth differentials within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will explain that these divergences are of a similar size to those observed within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Moreover, inflation differentials are often a normal and welcome equilibrating mechanism within a large currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Similarly, persistent real growth differentials may reflect a normal and healthy catching-up process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.19,0)">However, they may also be caused by cross-country differences in economic structures and in the design of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The first years of the euro – price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations … When taking a closer look at those developments that can be influenced by monetary policy, there can be little doubt that the EMU project has been a great success, which is particularly remarkable against the background of the many and sizeable economic shocks that have hit the euro area since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">When looking at the euro area as a whole, a regime shift towards greater monetary stability took place during the second half of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This was associated with the EMU project enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, and in particular with the convergence process and the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Since the ECB became responsible for monetary policy in the euro area in 1999, HICP inflation has averaged 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is very near to the “below and close to 2%” at which the ECB aims over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">Let me remind you that during the 1980s and 1990s, the average inflation rate was 4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Inflation expectations have also been remarkably stable in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.72,0)">Average long-term consensus inflation expectations have fallen from 2.8% in the 1990s   to 1.8% over the past six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is fully in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The very low levels of short-term and long-term interest rates which we are currently observing are providing substantial support to favourable financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.06,0)">These low levels would be unthinkable without the successful stabilisation of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">… have also contributed to low macroeconomic volatility A further remarkable feature of the change in economic performance is the strong decline in nominal macroeconomic volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.64,0)">With the convergence process during the 1990s, inflation volatility fell strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.07,0)">The volatility of quarterly HICP inflation in the euro area   fell from around 0.6 percentage point during the late 1980s to less than 0.3 percentage point in the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Since then, inflation volatility has stabilised at this very low level, in spite of major inflationary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">And the average volatility of long-term consensus inflation expectations has also declined substantially, by four-fifths, from almost 0.5 percentage point in the 1990s to around 0.1 percentage point in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Lower volatility of actual and expected inflation reduces consumer and investor uncertainty and thereby enhances welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Stable inflation expectations and a high degree of confidence on the part of financial market participants in monetary policy should, over time, also lead to a reduction in the volatility of longer-term interest rates, and thus also to lower risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.71,0)">Indeed, over the past six years, there has been a substantial decline in the volatility of long-term interest rates as compared with that recorded in the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.16,0)">In the 1990s, for example, the standard deviation of long-term interest rates   was around 2 percentage points; in the past six years, this measure has fallen to a little more than ½ a percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.74,0)">It is striking that, while the volatility of long-term interest rates in the euro area was still around twice as high as that in the United States in the 1990s, the situation has reversed in the last six years, with euro area interest rate volatility now being below that observed in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Anchoring inflation expectations is not only important for low medium- and long-term market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It is also crucial for reducing macroeconomic fluctuations in response to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.81,0)">There are some hints that the persistence of inflation in recent years has been lower than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It is likely that this has resulted, at least partly, from the improved anchoring of inflation expectations which may, in turn, have led to a more forward-looking behaviour on the part of those setting prices and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Less indexation of wages and prices to current and past inflation would tend to contribute to lower volatility of employment and output in response to macroeconomic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Importantly, the achievements in the area of monetary stability have not come at the cost of higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.53,0)">On the contrary, the unemployment rate has averaged around 8½% over the past six years and has therefore been more than one percentage point lower, on average, than in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Annual employment growth   has doubled from an average of around ½% in the 1980s and 1990s to slightly above 1% since the start of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Average real GDP growth has been 1.9% in the past six years, which is close to the average of 2.0% in the 1990s  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.45,0)">Moreover, there are no visible signs of costs in terms of higher real macroeconomic volatility; on the contrary, in recent years the volatility of some real variables has also declined relative to the averages observed during the 1980s and 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.5,0)">For example, the standard deviation of quarter-on-quarter percentage changes of real GDP growth has fallen from around 0.5 percentage point in the 1990s to around 0.4 percentage point in the last six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">The volatility of employment growth has also fallen from over 0.3 percentage point to 0.2 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">All in all, however, some encouraging structural reforms notwithstanding, the high degree of monetary stability achieved stands in contrast to the as yet insufficient flexibility and dynamism of some euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The latter phenomenon explains why the success of EMU has not been accompanied by higher real growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.67,0)">In particular labour productivity growth has been weak since the mid-1990s, and unemployment in many euro area countries is still far too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">These problems need to be addressed by stepping up structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.24,0)">An inflationary monetary policy would certainly not be of help – on the contrary, it would make things worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The preconditions for credibility and anchoring of inflation expectations Let me now turn to the question of why we have been able to stabilise inflation expectations, and thus interest rates, at low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">I discussed the convergence of long-term interest rates to very low levels in the late 1990s in a recent presentation , in which I attributed this success to a shift to a more credible policy regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Several institutional provisions enshrined in the Treaty as well as strategic decisions of the Governing Council of the ECB have been necessary preconditions for a credible monetary policy and a successful anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">With regard to the key institutional provisions, the ECB has been given a clear mandate, namely to pursue the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and its independence is fully guaranteed by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Furthermore, rules for pursuing sound fiscal policies are enshrined in the Treaty in the form of the Maastricht criteria; the Stability and Growth Pact implements these principles via regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As regards the key strategic decisions, the Governing Council of the ECB has designed a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This monetary policy concept is based on an arithmetic definition of price stability and on a two-pillar approach involving not only an economic pillar, but also a monetary pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Our commitment to monitoring monetary developments provides powerful support to anchoring long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The precise definition of price stability for the euro area showed full continuity with the national central banks’ earlier core definitions of price stability and thus ensured that inflation expectations for the new currency would be the same as for the most credible national currencies immediately before the setting up of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Finally, the ECB has opted for a high degree of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">From the very beginning, key features of the monetary policy strategy have been published.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Moreover, almost in real time, the monthly assessment of the Governing Council and the reasons for the interest rate decisions taken are presented to the public at the press conferences immediately following the first Governing Council meeting of each month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">All of these factors have contributed to the high degree of credibility enjoyed by the ECB’s monetary policy and thus to price stability and the successful anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But credibility is never gained once and for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It has to be permanently preserved and enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That is why, for central bankers, vigilance is always of the essence and why the ECB pays the utmost attention to monitoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Inflation and growth differentials among countries in the euro area are moderate … In recent months there has been a renewed interest in the issue of economic differentials between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Regional differentials in growth and inflation are a standard feature of all large currency areas around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the euro area these differentials are of a similar size to those observed within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.03,0)">Let me provide some figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The degree of inflation dispersion across the euro area countries was characterised by a strong downward trend in the 1980s and 1990s and has broadly stabilised since the inception of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.8,0)">Inflation dispersion among the euro area countries   was around 6 percentage points in late 1990, while it amounted to slightly less than 1 percentage point in spring 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.32,0)">The average inflation dispersion across the euro area countries has been 1 percentage point since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This figure is very close to the dispersion observed across the 14 US metropolitan statistical areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.76,0)">The dispersion of real GDP growth rates in the euro area has, since 1999, remained very close to its historic average, without any signs of increased divergence having emerged so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.07,0)">In the period from 1999 to 2004, the average dispersion of annual real GDP growth   was around 2 percentage points, and thus very close to the average dispersion of real growth rates since the 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.61,0)">By comparison, the dispersion of real growth across the US States fluctuated around an average of 2½ percentage points between 1990 and 2002, while the average dispersion of the real growth rates was around 1½ percentage points across the eight US statistical regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">… and may reflect welcome adjustment processes In a monetary union, inflation and labour cost differentials across regions or countries are the natural means of adjusting relative prices in the face of asymmetric demand or supply developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The fact that the single monetary policy cannot address specific circumstances in individual countries implies that flexible wages and prices are needed in order to deal with regional shocks or disparities in relative demand across regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.06,0)">For example, regions facing a shortfall in demand relative to potential supply or a loss in cost competitiveness need to exhibit lower prices and costs for domestically produced services and goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If wages and prices are flexible and respond quickly, this will support employment and purchasing power and thus contribute to closing the demand shortfall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In addition, price and wage changes below the euro area average imply that the competitiveness of the country would increase vis-à-vis the other regions and, as a result, that external demand would also contribute to closing the gap between actual and potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.32,0)">If labour and product markets are rigid, however, the shortfall in demand will not lead to a swift and adequate decline in relative wages and prices, unemployment in the region will increase and the related regional disparities could persist for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this context, I should like to make three remarks concerning the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, changes in relative prices within the single currency area have been larger and more frequent than anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.16,0)">The idea that the euro area is an area in which the single currency prevents adjustment of relative prices has been clearly refuted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For instance, the capacity of the German economy to catch up rapidly with the average of the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness after the loss of competitiveness associated with German reunification has been very impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Strong increases in relative unit labour costs during the first half of the 1990s contributed, with some lag, to higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">For example, between 1992 and 1998, unemployment in Germany increased by almost 2½ percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In recent years, however, increases in unit labour costs have been very moderate, so that the conditions for job creation have clearly improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This development also shows that wages and prices are more flexible than sometimes thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">From that point of view, the euro area is more flexible and adaptable than was anticipated by a number of observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.52,0)">Second, the aforementioned process is symmetric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.52,0)">In some cases the existence of positive inflation differentials is the natural consequence for an economy that has been outperforming the average in terms of cost competitiveness and reached rather low levels of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">For such economies inflation above the euro area average may be the natural way to adust towards a more normal price level in line with the average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This problem had been observed, for instance, in the case of the Netherlands and is possibly still relevant for Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Third, inflation differentials are not only the necessary means of achieving relative price adjustments within the euro area, as in the case of Germany, they are also a natural feature of some economies in the euro area in view of their gradual convergence and catching-up process with regard to the average European GDP per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Real growth differentials may be welcome if they reflect such a healthy catching-up process on the part of less advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.37,0)">Indeed, since the mid-1990s, most of the countries which previously had GDP per capita levels significantly below the euro area average have experienced above-average real GDP growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is particularly true for Ireland, Spain and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">A healthy catching-up process is not a zero sum game, it is a win-win situation, as those countries which are already more productive can benefit from increased trade and investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Crucially, EMU increases the chances of achieving such a welcome outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">A credible monetary policy anchors inflation expectations and increases market transparency, thereby facilitating the necessary adjustment of relative prices across different countries or sectors in the presence of economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">In addition to the positive effects of monetary stability, a single currency enhances the processes of financial and trade integration within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And we have also observed increased risk-sharing between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Thus, the euro and the single monetary policy contribute not only to the competitiveness of the euro area and to job creation, but also to real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Cross-country differences may also signal the need for changes in national economic policies I have just given three economic reasons why cross-country differentials in price and labour cost changes reflect welcome adjustments in relative prices within a single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.59,0)">However, there is one case in which such differentials are not advisable in terms of national economic policies: this is when an economy with an already relatively low level of cost competitiveness and high unemployment faces further deterioration on account of higher price and cost inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">In that case, additional attention must be given to increasing the flexibility and adaptability of the institutions and market structures in the national economy concerned in order to allow the appropriate adjustment mechanism to function, and to redress the relative deterioration of cost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.26,0)">There are cases where lasting real growth differentials do not reflect welcome catching-up processes, but rather structural deficiencies in some countries, leading to low trend output growth and persistently high unemployment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.23,0)">Such divergences between different countries are independent of whether or not these countries share the same currency, and in any case cannot be addressed by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.4,0)">Countries that show a relatively poor performance in terms of longer-term trends of real growth and job creation are often also those whose domestic economy has been less flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">For these countries structural reforms are highly advisable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Measures aimed at strengthening product market competition, labour market flexibility and thus job creation would certainly be welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">They would enhance the incentives for firms to both invest in real and human capital and offer new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Close monitoring of unit labour cost and wage moderation are also, in such cases, essential to reduce excessively high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.99,0)">The more successful the structural measures are, the more jobs will be created at current wage levels and the less wage moderation will thus be needed in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">However, for those sectors and areas of qualification in which unemployment is high and/or the competitiveness of domestic workers is threatened, wage moderation, will be important to support job creation, and thus consumption demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Let me stress that both types of measure – reforms and wage moderation – support employment even in a rather closed economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Of course, both measures would tend also to enhance external competitiveness, but their positive effects do not depend on this latter channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.27,0)">Sometimes a radically different equilibrating mechanism is suggested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It has been argued that a euro area country that experiences relatively weak aggregate demand should increase wages more strongly in order to ensure higher demand for domestic goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.46,0)">This would, however, be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.69,0)">Higher real wage and unit labour costs in areas where unemployment is too high would undermine job creation and thus reduce demand and supply even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Of course, once full employment has been reached, real wages can and should grow in line with productivity increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">All countries and economies benefit substantially from EMU As I am speaking here in Mannheim, let me emphasise that the economies that had a very credible currency before the euro such as Germany are benefiting substantially from their integration into the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The euro is as credible and stable as the Deutsche Mark before it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The purchasing power of German workers and consumers has been enhanced by relatively cheap imports from countries within Europe and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Employment has been supported by strong export growth, not least to euro area and EU trading partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.64,0)">Market interest rates and thus financing costs have not only been maintained at the previous low levels but they are at historically very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.26,0)">The fact that in some economies inflation has been somewhat lower than the euro area average for some time should not be seen as a disadvantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">It supports the purchasing power of consumers, and it is a reflection of the increasing cost competitiveness of the production of these economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The success of German exports offers a good illustration of that phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.39,0)">Some observers have argued that traditionally low interest rate economies are suffering as a result of EMU, as their interest rate comparative advantage relative to other countries was removed with the convergence process and the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, the fact that all euro area countries now enjoy stable prices, low inflation expectations and thus low financing costs is also beneficial for economies such as Germany, not least by enhancing trade and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">On top of that the elimination of any exchange risk within the euro area is also beneficial for all euro area countries including for the traditionally low interest rate economies which have in the past suffered a lot from the materialisation of such risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude my presentation by coming back to the subject of this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I have explained today how EMU and a credible monetary policy benefit all euro area countries and create great opportunities for a dynamic economy and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A good monetary policy is necessary and can achieve a lot – but cannot, alone, guarantee full success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">Other conditions are also necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">One cannot stress enough that a high degree of competition and a functioning market economy are crucial preconditions for job creation, high real wages and, more generally, high living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.29,0)">Laws or institutions that hinder competition between existing firms and the entry of new competitors and thus the effective working of market mechanisms tend to support excess prices, incomes and profits in those sectors that are protected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.9,0)">Of course, the costs of such protection have to be borne by consumers in the form of overly high prices and by the unemployed in the form of fewer opportunities for new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, it is not only the competitiveness of firms that is of great importance in our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In addition, we need to enhance the functioning of labour markets and to provide incentives for investing in human capital in order to ensure the “competitiveness of labour”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">A single currency and identical policy rates across the euro area in a certain sense also enhance the possibility to better compare economic performances between Member States and to draw lessons from national experiences in terms of economic structures and policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.26,0)">A single monetary policy implies that lasting divergences in unemployment levels and real growth trends are caused predominantly by different economic
