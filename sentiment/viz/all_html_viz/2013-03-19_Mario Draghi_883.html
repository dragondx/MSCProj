    <span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)"> Opening remarks at the conference ‘Post-trade harmonisation and the integration of financial markets: a joint effort’ Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 19 March 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you to Frankfurt today and to open this important conference on post-trade harmonisation and financial market integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This conference is the result of a joint effort between the European Central Bank and the European Commission, and I would like to thank the organisers for putting together such an excellent programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I am very pleased to see that so many distinguished speakers from both the public and private sectors have agreed to share their views on how post-trade harmonisation will contribute to financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In times of severe economic challenges, it is particularly important that our commitment to achieving a truly single European market is reaffirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">As we all understand, a well-functioning internal market generates many benefits, including lower prices, more freedom of choice for individuals and better opportunities for firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">What Europe has achieved so far is indisputable – and it is often taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.24,0)">People sometimes focus on perceived difficulties caused by the single market from an individual or national perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">But it is important to acknowledge the huge benefits of European integration for our daily lives and day-to-day business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Greater financial integration is a key part of building the single market – and something that improves the functioning of national financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Financial integration leads to better risk-sharing and diversification, it makes markets deeper and more liquid, and it encourages competition, which in turn reduces the costs of intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In addition, financial integration fosters more efficient allocation of capital, higher productivity, and stronger and more sustainable non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Financial integration is essential to making Europe stronger, so it is very important to the ECB’s Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">We are fully committed to making it happen, especially at a time when the fragmentation of the single financial market has led to fragmentation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.11,0)">As you will be aware, the disruptive effects of severe fragmentation in the single financial market have tangible consequences, such as diverging funding costs for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.51,0)">This has resulted in the uneven transmission of our interest rate reductions to firms and households across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">For this reason, the ECB has had to identify the most effective policy tools for repairing these disruptions, while remaining within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Financial integration is clearly in the interests of the market and it is strongly supported by the post-trade harmonisation initiatives that are taking place within the EU at the legislative, operational and business levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">These initiatives all aim to remove national barriers and thus reduce the fragmentation of the European post-trade landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The integration of market infrastructure, the harmonisation agenda triggered by T2S and the regulatory framework are the key elements of a coordinated harmonisation effort that complements and supports financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is through this lens that the topic of today’s conference should be analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Key questions include: how can we contribute to improving post‑trade harmonisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.37,0)">What will this process change?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And what actions can we take to benefit from it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The speakers will give us their answers and explore the various harmonisation initiatives, linking them with changes in the regulatory framework and in market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Last May, I participated, along with some of you, in the signing of the contractual agreements between the Eurosystem and those CSDs that had decided to participate in T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">I stressed that the fundamental objective of T2S is to contribute to making Europe a better place to invest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me say that this objective is not unique to T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is the objective of all the harmonisation efforts that are being undertaken in the post‑trade field, by all parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">It is definitely a joint effort, and what I see is not just the commitment of public authorities at the European or national level, but also the commitment of market participants, CSDs and CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I am sure that we all share the same goal, namely making Europe stronger and more attractive for both domestic and foreign investment, thus stimulating and sustaining growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Through the coordinated action of so many stakeholders, financial markets will become safer, more transparent and, therefore, more efficient and integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Dismantling legal and operational barriers, which is the aim of current EU legislative proposals and new infrastructure such as T2S, will benefit those who adapt their business models to a more competitive landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It is important to highlight that the benefits of T2S will be fully achieved if the current harmonisation efforts are successfully implemented at the European level and especially at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me be specific here by giving you a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In terms of infrastructure, T2S is the necessary platform for setting up a single European market for securities services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In terms of benefits for Europe, T2S will make the post-trade environment safer and more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It will reduce the cost of settling securities transactions and bring about significant collateral savings for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">These collateral savings are particularly valuable at a time when demand for high-quality collateral continues to increase, as a result of both the crisis and new regulatory developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">But reaping the full benefits from the launch of T2S requires that it is complemented by the provisions laid out in the CSD regulation proposed by the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Both initiatives are supported by the harmonisation agenda which has been advanced by the Eurosystem and other European fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The CSD regulation is critical to post-trade harmonisation efforts in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council has stated its strong support for the proposed regulation, which will enhance the legal and operational conditions for cross-border settlement in the EU in general and in T2S in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB has recommended that the proposed regulation and the corresponding implementing acts are adopted prior to the launch of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Work is also in progress at the Eurosystem level to improve the possibilities for the cross-border use of collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, which will increase efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Further benefits are expected from market-led initiatives to enhance the interoperability of triparty services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I do not want to pre-empt the interesting discussions that you will have today, so let me conclude by saying that everyone needs to be involved in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Every contribution matters; and every action is relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">I am confident that today’s conference will further clarify the role that each of us has to play in this important phase of European integration, and I look forward to continuing to work on it together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
