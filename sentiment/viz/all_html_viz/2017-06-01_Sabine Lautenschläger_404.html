    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Banks business models: keeping pace?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Seventeenth Annual Conference on Policy Challenges for the Financial Sector, Washington D.C., 1 June 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, There are 19 countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They all share one currency, but differ in many other respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.09,0)">Their economic structures, tax codes and legal frameworks differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.04,0)">Their macroeconomic characteristics, such as growth, inflation and employment, also differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This mix of economies requires a mix of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And in the euro area, banks are indeed varied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">There are large banks that operate on the global stage and small ones that focus on domestic business; there are banks which are profitable and there are banks which have not earned their cost of capital for several years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.02,0)">All these banks face similar challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, they have to deal with geopolitical risks, that is, with higher uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.58,0)">Second, they have to deal with a challenging macroeconomic environment; and that includes low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.47,0)">Hence, banks have to adjust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">They have to become more cost-efficient and diversify their revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.12,0)">Third, they have to deal with overcapacities in the European banking market; many banks compete for the same customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Fourth, they have to deal with technological change, such as digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">That change attracts new competitors to the market, the famous fintechs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">This makes the market even more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.45,0)">And fifth, they have to deal with tougher rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">That includes higher capital requirements, more reporting and higher demands with regard to the scope and quality of risk management – just think of the BCBS 239.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So banks are important, and they face challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That’s why we take a very close look at how banks in the euro area make profits and how their business models work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That is a core element of our annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, or SREP as we call it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">When we assess business models, we combine two things: an analysis of hard data and the judgement of experienced supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This helps us to be unbiased, holistic and forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And we benefit from our European viewpoint, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Unlike national supervisors, we can compare and benchmark 125 banking groups across the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">That is a big advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Altogether, we have defined nine different categories of business model, ranging from large universal banks and domestic lenders to specialised asset managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We then place each bank in one of these categories and can thus compare it to its European peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Like all supervisors, we ask one very general question: can a bank generate sufficient returns within a framework of suitable risk appetite and on the basis of a clear and sustainable funding structure?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">For us, a business model is viable if it can generate such returns over the year ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">And it is sustainable if it can generate such returns over a three-year period and through a full business and economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The first step we take when we analyse a business model is to map out the general strategy of the bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">We try to understand its main sources of profit and how they might be affected by economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We then refine the map by comparing the bank with its peers across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">As I just mentioned, this is one of the main benefits of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The next step is then to derive an automated score.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This score is based on indicators such as the return on assets and the cost-to-income-ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">And as I already said, we then complement the scoring with expert judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In doing so, we take a forward-looking approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.91,0)">And what we look for are key vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We assess how profits might evolve over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We analyse the bank’s strategic plan; we take into account its financial forecasts and assess how it might be affected by internal and external factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the light of this assessment, we might adjust the score.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The final result then feeds into the SREP and guides us when we determine supervisory capital add-ons and other measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As the ECB is still a young supervisor, we still need to learn more and dig deeper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">That’s why, in 2016, we launched a thematic review of banks’ profitability drivers at firm level and across business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">That review is still ongoing and will provide some more tools to support us when we analyse business models and monitor profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">It will strengthen our ability to identify banks with structurally low profits; and it will examine in depth how banks respond to weak profits – now and in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">The thematic review will conclude at the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Are we satisfied with the business models of banks in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Are we satisfied with the progress banks have made by learning the lessons of the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In all honesty, have you ever met a supervisor who was satisfied with anything?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">I haven’t – that is just not in our DNA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is true, of course, that many European banks have made a lot of progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">They have significantly raised their capital and liquidity buffers, they have got rid of a lot of bad assets, they have refocused their business, and they have streamlined their cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">So far so good!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.75,0)">But even though banks have started doing their homework, they haven’t finished yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.08,0)">There are some banks that still have a long to-do list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.5,0)">And a few banks even have to improve the contents of their list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.72,0)">So again, the banks in the euro area paint a very mixed picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The good news is that there are about two dozen larger banks that have successfully navigated the choppy waters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.86,0)">These banks come from many different countries and have different business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.9,0)">What sets them apart is that they generate more income than their peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Many of them outperform in terms of interest income, but other factors also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">To sum up: banks in the euro area differ in terms of size, business model, legacy issues and their preparedness for whatever the future may hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.72,0)">Quite a few banks still have homework to do or need to implement what they have already decided to do in order to cope with the new challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.34,0)">This variety makes life a bit more difficult for investors and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But as diverse as the banks might be, they all play an important role – and by and large, they are the ones, and not so much the capital markets, who keep the European economy running and growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Thus, we need performing and stable banks in Europe to provide loans and other services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">We need banks that are not held back by the mistakes of the past, but which have been cleaned up and are able to do business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.97,0)">We also need tough rules and tough supervisors who challenge banks’ business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In the long run, only banks that make profits can be stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">And only stable banks can handle uncertainty, deal with a changing environment and reliably serve the economy.</span>
