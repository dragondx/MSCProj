    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.86,0)"> The banking sector – where did we end up after all the reforms?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Opening statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, to panel 1 "After all the reforms: Where did we end up?"</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.51,0)">at the 6th Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy: "European Financial Markets – Too Much Variety?"</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">in Frankfurt, 14 December 2018 It’s often said that in every crisis there is an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And in the case of the financial crisis, I think that regulators have seized that opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.98,0)">The crisis prompted an overhaul of banking regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And it did so not just at the national or European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Through the G20 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the reforms became a common project at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">So what was the general idea behind these reforms?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The primary aim was to address specific issues that had been laid bare by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This was the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.62,0)">But regulators knew, of course, that the latest crisis is never a blueprint for the next one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.21,0)">The next crisis might come in a completely different form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">So the second step was to enhance the general resilience of banks, to make them strong enough to withstand any type of storm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This idea underpins the three main building blocks of the reforms: Capital, liquidity and governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">And much has been done on all three fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Banks not only have to hold more capital than they did before the crisis; their capital also needs to be of higher quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.49,0)">Banks can therefore suffer more losses before they actually fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">At the same time, banks have to fulfil much stricter liquidity standards than before, providing them with a cushion in case trust evaporates and funding dries up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This allows banks to survive such a situation for longer than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Reforms to improve governance and risk management have also come about, but these have received less attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.08,0)">For too long, governance and risk management have taken a backseat in public or academic debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But they are just as important as capital and liquidity – if not more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">After all, good governance and sound risk management help to prevent a bank from getting into trouble in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.37,0)">Capital and liquidity are merely backstops for bad management – or bad luck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">New rules help banks to set up appropriate processes and integrate them into their organisational structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.35,0)">In this context, one of the standards developed by the Basel Committee is somewhat underappreciated in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I am referring to the BCBS 239 principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting, which play a significant role in adequately managing the risks of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In order to make sound decisions, top management needs sound data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">These are the basics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Where do we stand in turning them into actual policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Well, it has taken some time to work through the long list of individual reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Some of them are already in place; others are now being implemented – with some delays here and there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The final part of Basel III was agreed a year ago, in December 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">So, this is the major set of reforms that still needs to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And while speed plays a role here, substance is also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The reforms need to be turned into actual law, and this law has to reflect what was agreed in Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It is important that this happens in all of the relevant financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.73,0)">And I fear that this might not be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.89,0)">Not least in Europe, it seems that some of the Basel standards might not be implemented faithfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.54,0)">This affects important things such as the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio and the fundamental review of the trading book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.99,0)">Other parts of the rulebook have also come under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Pillar 2 capital is a recent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Supervisors set the level of Pillar 2 capital to account for risks which are not, or are only partially, covered by regulatory capital requirements; it is thus an important additional tool for making banks more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So far, significant banks in the euro area have had to cover their Pillar 2 requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, the highest quality of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.67,0)">This, however, might change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In the future, banks might generally be allowed to use lower-quality capital to build up their Pillar 2 buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Such a change will encourage banks and markets to come up with financial innovations with regard to additional tier 1 capital, or AT1 for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And this is something we supervisors are not very keen on, not least because we have already seen significant market volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.77,0)">On top of that, the playing field for large and small banks might become uneven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.5,0)">Unlike large banks, smaller banks are often unable to access AT1 markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">So the opportunity to use AT1 in order to meet Pillar 2 requirements would be of little benefit to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Large banks, by contrast, would have an advantage, not least because AT1 coupons are tax-deductible in most Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.59,0)">To sum up: banks would become less resilient and the playing field less even.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">But let me come back to Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The reforms we agreed on in Basel do make sense, and they strengthen the resilience of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A key feature of the reforms is their global nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">They are designed to ensure not only safer and sounder banks but also a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">So if reforms are not implemented as agreed, the playing field will become uneven, opening the door to regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.77,0)">But regulation is not the only game in town, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.99,0)">Supervision counts too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">And although supervisors need rules to guide their work, they see that not everything can be or should be captured by rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Global reforms such as those devised in Basel and their transposition into European law cannot be perfectly tailored to each and every business model that banks pursue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">At best, rules can cover the average case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is particularly true in a sector that is changing as quickly as banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">So it is up to the supervisor to adapt the capital requirements to a bank’s specific risk profile in order to cater for deviations from the average case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To this end, the rules should be principle-based and leave sufficient discretion to the supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.73,0)">In the European context, this need is even greater, as nowadays, we often have to deal with 19 slightly different national rules applying to the same case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Common principle-based regulation, applied to all 19 countries, would allow supervisors to cater for bank-specific risks in their national environment, thus ensuring a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">So, let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The overarching question is: have the reforms so far helped to make the banking sector a safer place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">My answer is: yes they have, but they still need to be finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The key point is to implement the reforms, to turn them into actual law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.0,0)">So, we cannot stand still; we have to move on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And under no circumstances should we move backwards.</span>
