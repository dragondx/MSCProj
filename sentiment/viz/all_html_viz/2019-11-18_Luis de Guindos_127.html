    <span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 2019 Opportunities and challenges for the euro area financial sector Opening speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 22nd Euro Finance Week I am honoured to open the 22nd Euro Finance Week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We gather here every year to discuss the recent financial and economic developments in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As we are going to publish our Financial Stability Review in two days’ time, today I will focus on the health of euro area financial institutions and the opportunities and challenges they face in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will also offer some policy considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.85,0)">Opportunities and challenges for euro area banks Let me start with euro area banks, which have been reporting persistently low profitability in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.63,0)">The aggregate return on equity of the sector slightly declined to less than 6% in the 12 months to June 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.4,0)">This weak performance is broad-based, with around 75% of significant banks generating returns below the 8% benchmark return demanded by investors for holding bank equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.5,0)">Poor profitability of course reflects both cyclical and structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.18,0)">The current macro-financial environment in the euro area is challenging for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.94,0)">The recent softening of the macroeconomic growth outlook and the associated low-for-longer interest rate environment are likely to weigh further on their profitability prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.67,0)">Many market analysts are concerned about the drag on bank profitability that could result from the negative impact of monetary policy accommodation on net interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.49,0)">And net interest margins are indeed under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.59,0)">Just focusing on this one aspect is misleading, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.05,0)">Importantly, it neglects the first-order effect of monetary policy in supporting economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.75,0)">Without this, bank lending volumes would have been significantly lower and provisioning costs substantially higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">These factors, together with the increase in asset values, have broadly offset the negative impact of low rates on net interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In addition, the introduction of the two-tier system for reserve remuneration will help mitigate the cost of negative interest rates for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.42,0)">Structural factors are at the heart of weak bank profitability, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.6,0)">In particular, euro area banks face challenges linked to the sector’s overcapacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.16,0)">There are too many banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.38,0)">Many of them have low market shares and so are under high competitive pressures, also from outside the sector, for example from fintech companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.35,0)">Another important dimension of overcapacity in the euro area is persistent cost inefficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.94,0)">Banks are not fully benefiting from economies of scale and are relying on overlapping physical distribution networks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">As a result, their cost-to-income ratios – currently at 66% – are high when compared with those of their peers in the United States and the Nordic countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">So, how can euro area banks return to sustainable profitability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">And how can they make more decisive progress in tackling structural challenges and cost inefficiencies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Let me mention two avenues which would support an increase in bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">First, there is room for banks to adjust their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, ECB analysis has found that the best performing banks have diversified their income sources, improved their cost efficiency and invested in digital technologies to a greater extent than their peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Second, consolidation via mergers and acquisitions may allow banks to exploit economies of scale and scope, which should bring about improved performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Cross-border mergers, while less likely to produce cost savings or economies of scale, would have an additional benefit of improved risk diversification and would thus result in more resilient profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">To this end, policy-makers may need to remove obstacles to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, promote further integration and pursue the banking union agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is also worth recalling the good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Banks have noticeably improved their resilience over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This largely reflects the new regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.42,0)">They now need to hold more and higher-quality regulatory capital and they must maintain liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">They also need to finance themselves through stable funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And they have to plan for their potential resolution and issue debt instruments that can be bailed in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">While these adjustments can be challenging in the short term, in the long term they increase the banking sector’s resilience to adverse shocks, reducing the likelihood of costly financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In fact, the euro area banking system already complies with the new requirements for high-quality capital and liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">But even though banks have improved their capital positions in recent years, only a small fraction of bank capital requirements are in the form of the countercyclical capital buffer  , which authorities can release in the event of systemic stress to help avoid costly economic deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This suggests that the current composition of capital requirements may need to be rebalanced to give the CCyB a more prominent role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Opportunities and challenges for euro area non-bank financial institutions I will now turn to the euro area non-bank financial sector, which has grown rapidly since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Its total assets have almost doubled over the last ten years, growing from €23 trillion in 2008 to almost €46 trillion in June 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Euro area non-banks are playing an increasingly important role in financing the euro area economy, especially through their sizeable investments in bonds issued by euro area non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.29,0)">Euro area investment funds, insurers and pension funds jointly hold half of these bonds, as opposed to 7% held by euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The greater role of non-banks can be positive from a financial stability perspective as it helps diversify the sources of financing provided to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Moreover, life insurers and pension funds typically provide one of the most stable sources of long-term financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.16,0)">But, similar to banks, non-banks also face several challenges in the current environment, with profitability being one of the major concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.28,0)">As bond yields have fallen, non-bank financial intermediaries are holding a growing share of low-yielding bonds, which decreases their investment income in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.03,0)">Many non-banks tend to compensate this by searching for yield in riskier, more illiquid and higher duration assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This can be a welcome and intended outcome of monetary policy accommodation as it may help to ease financing conditions for non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.75,0)">But this trend also has a flip side, it contributes to rising risks and vulnerabilities in non-banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.44,0)">Liquidity risk is a particular source of concern, as illiquid funds can face severe difficulties in dealing with large-scale outflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.86,0)">Over the past one and a half years there have been several cases of UCITS funds under such stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.96,0)">All these funds had large liquidity mismatches on their balance sheets as they invested in illiquid assets but offered daily redemptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.56,0)">Another source of concern is the elevated exposure of non-banks to highly indebted segments of the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.43,0)">Excessive risk-taking may adversely affect the ability of non-banks to absorb shocks, especially if economic conditions deteriorate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.43,0)">Moreover, downgrades of corporates to sub-investment grade ratings may force non-banks to sell assets to fulfil their investment mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This could amplify price movements in credit markets in times of low market liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.81,0)">It could also generate spill-overs to the wider financial system and the real economy, as funding flows might recede and the cost of corporate financing might increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.87,0)">Against this background, we need to think about potential gaps in the current regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, we should embark on developing a macroprudential framework for the non-bank financial sector, which is still in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Additional policy instruments should ensure that non-banks can sustain their financing of the real economy under different economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">They should aim to mitigate risks related to procyclical risk taking and excessive leverage, liquidity and maturity transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">One could consider macroprudential restrictions on fund leverage and additional liquidity management tools that align redemption terms more closely with the liquidity of funds’ assets, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The policy tools should also provide incentives for non-banks to internalise the impact that their actions have on the rest of the financial system and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In particular, such policy tools could mitigate non-banks’ potential to amplify exuberance in upturns and adversely affect financial and economic conditions in downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">Of course we cannot have a one size fits all approach for non-banks and we need to account for differences in balance sheet structures and business models when designing any macroprudential policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">But the growing size of non-bank financial institutions, their greater importance to the financing of the real economy and their interconnectedness with the rest of the system highlight the importance of developing a sound macroprudential framework for this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">Currently, one of the most significant vulnerabilities of euro area banks relates to their weak profitability prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.03,0)">The lacklustre outlook reflects both structural and cyclical factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.98,0)">The banking system is operating with significant overcapacity resulting in persistent cost inefficiencies and competitive pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">At the same time, the weaker cyclical momentum and associated low interest rates are weighing on bank profitability, although monetary policy accommodation has supported lending volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, we need to acknowledge that banks have made significant progress in repairing balance sheets since the outbreak of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Nevertheless, a rebalancing of the current composition of capital requirements towards a more prominent role for the CCyB could help mitigate costly economic deleveraging in downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Non-bank financial intermediaries have grown rapidly over recent years in the euro area, which is a welcome development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.01,0)">But similar to banks, they are also facing profitability headwinds in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.11,0)">As a consequence, they are searching for yield in riskier assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Given their increasing importance in financing the real economy, their increased risks and vulnerabilities highlight the need for the development of a macroprudential framework for this sector.</span><span
