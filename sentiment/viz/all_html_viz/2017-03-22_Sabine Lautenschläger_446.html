    <span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)"> Caution should be the life of banking Introductory statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the AFME Board Meeting in Frankfurt, 22 March 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, Taking risks is at the heart of any healthy business, including banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">After all, it is the job of banks to take and allocate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">But as Walter Bagehot said: “Adventure is the life of commerce, but caution is the life of banking”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">I agree with him.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.47,0)">Banks are far too important for the economy to indulge in adventures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They enable business by providing loans to companies or by helping them to tap the capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And they also facilitate business by providing services in fields such as payments, mergers and acquisitions, and global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Banks help the economy to grow and prosper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.72,0)">But they can also badly hurt it; we saw that in the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.83,0)">That’s why banks need to be cautious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In practical terms that requires, among other things, sound risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this sets the scene for my short statement today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.85,0)">The topic is risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will begin with some smaller, or rather bank-specific, risk management topics and end with a few big issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Sound risk management depends on good data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.31,0)">It also depends on firm-wide risk aggregation and reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">Those who take decisions must be in the picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.81,0)">Well, in the crisis we learnt that decision-makers often were not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.75,0)">IT systems, data architecture and related processes were not up to the mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Against that backdrop, we assessed how banks aggregate data and report risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The yardstick was a set of global best practices that were defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">These are known as the BCBS 239 principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.92,0)">The result of our review: many banks do not meet the global standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">As usual, we will therefore be very explicit on how these banks should improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">And we will closely monitor the progress made by the respective banks to ensure that they meet relevant standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, good risk data is one thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.11,0)">But processing such data is another matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">And that leads me to my next topic: internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Many large banks use these models to calculate their risk-weighted assets, which then serve as a basis for calculating capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.22,0)">Over the past years, internal models have diverged greatly, not least due to the fact that supervisors applied different standards when authorising them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In response, we have launched a project called TRIM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That stands for “targeted review of internal models”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It aims to ensure two things: first, that the playing field is level; second, that internal models produce reliable and comparable results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The calculation of risk-weighted assets should be driven by actual risks rather than by modelling choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">TRIM will help to raise trust in how banks calculate their risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, there are small risks and big risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.5,0)">There are risks that affect a single bank and risks that affect the entire sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And then there are risks that stretch across sectors and even countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In that regard, there is one thing that comes to mind: Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.43,0)">Right now, it is still very unclear how the world will look after the UK has left the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Still, banks and supervisors must prepare for any scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.29,0)">The worst case would certainly be a “hard Brexit”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In that scenario, the UK would become a “third country” from the viewpoint of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.28,0)">As a result, UK banks might lose their European passport and, with it, access to the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.16,0)">This would affect many of the 40 UK banking groups that currently operate in the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.52,0)">They would then have to find another way in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Most likely, they would seek to obtain a banking licence in an EU country to regain the passport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the euro area, these licences are granted by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We obviously don’t care whether UK banks move to Frankfurt, Dublin, Paris or some other location in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">What we care about are safe and sound banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">We will therefore resist any supervisory or regulatory race to the bottom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Any bank that moves to the euro area will have to meet our standards – regardless of whether it comes from the UK or any other place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Most importantly, we will not accept empty shell companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">All entities in the euro area must have adequate local risk management, sufficient local staff and operational independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">All that should be self-evident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.78,0)">Banks which seek to permanently book all exposures back-to-back with another entity in London should change their plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And so should banks that plan to book all exposures with a euro area entity while having their risk management somewhere else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.54,0)">We are aware that it is a burden for UK banks to apply for a new licence in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">With a view to internal models, we would aim to be accommodating regarding the timing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There will be a transitional period in which new euro area entities might use internal models that have not yet been approved by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.54,0)">But of course, there are conditions attached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, the relevant models must have been approved by the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We would also reflect on any comments on the quality of the models from our UK colleagues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Second, the banks must have applied for internal model approval in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.67,0)">The transitional period will cease as soon as we have approved or rejected the bank’s model application.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, sound banks are at the heart of a strong economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Banks therefore should note Walter Bagehot’s words and remain cautious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is our job as supervisors to help them do so and steer clear of risky adventures.</span>
