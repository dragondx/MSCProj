    <h1> Risks to banks – from inside and out </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th Asia-Pacific High-level meeting on Banking Supervision, in Sydney, 13 February 2019 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)"> Risks to banks – from inside and out Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th Asia-Pacific High-level meeting on Banking Supervision, in Sydney, 13 February 2019 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here today!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">And not only because it allows me to escape the cold German winter, but also because this meeting allows us to share views from opposite ends of the world – views from Asia and Australia and views from Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The crisis has shown how important it is to do just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">How important it is to be aware of what’s going on elsewhere, of how closely markets and market participants are interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">After all, a crisis that breaks out on one side of the globe can quickly spread to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So, being aware is one thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">But the crisis forced us to go further; it forced us to join forces – not only in overcoming problems as they arose, but also in revamping the regulatory and supervisory framework afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This happened at the global level – Basel III – and at the regional level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In Europe, policymakers went further than anywhere else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the height of the crisis, they decided to set up a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The first step was to take banking supervision from the national to the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So, in 2014, the ECB became responsible for supervising banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Has this worked out?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I still remember that, back in 2014, I heard quite a few critical voices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Not everyone believed that European banking supervision would actually work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Four years later, this has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">European banking supervision has been set up, it is running smoothly, and it contributes to making banks safer and sounder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But it was quite some job, I can tell you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.13,0)">I remember the early days, when we were just a handful of people sitting in a half-deserted building in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I remember how we began to hire staff – around 1,000 – for the ECB, and how we began to bring together the supervisors in national authorities, supporting them in adopting the new European supervisory approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I remember the comprehensive assessment we carried out on the banks that we would later supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We were like a start-up; we still are, in fact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">We are constantly innovating, learning and growing together as a European team of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And this European aspect is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">As European supervisors, we can take a higher vantage point; we can see and act across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As a national supervisor at the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and the Deutsche Bundesbank, I supervised 20 large banks – all from Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the SSM, we supervise around 120 large banks from across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">You can imagine the greater depth of insight that we gain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">We benchmark all these banks against their peers; by comparing them we can more easily spot new trends, new risks and new vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We can clearly distinguish the nodes and links of the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And see what works and what doesn’t – both on the banking and the supervision side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me give you just one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.26,0)">It’s no secret that European banks have a profitability problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In analysing this problem, we benefited a great deal from our cross-country perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">We could identify a number of banks that constantly outperform their peers, and we could assess the factors behind their success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This would not have been possible if we had looked only at a national sample of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But now that I have lavishly praised the concept of European banking supervision, let’s turn to the banks and the risks they face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Risks from the outside – the economy, geopolitics and technology And there are plenty of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.76,0)">Plenty of risks that interact in complicated ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So, for brevity’s sake, I won’t address all the risks that exist but will focus on just a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.63,0)">I will start with one of the issues that has, unfortunately, become a hallmark of the euro area banking sector: non-performing loans, or NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.77,0)">In early 2015, significant institutions in the euro area held almost €1 trillion worth of bad loans on their balance sheets and the aggregate NPL ratio stood at 7.5% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This average, however, masks big differences: NPL ratios ranged from around 1.5% in Luxembourg to more than 45% in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.41,0)">The banks therefore had a heavy burden to carry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After all, NPLs require special care and so tie up management resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.79,0)">They also pose a higher risk of losses, require provisions, tie up capital and affect lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.22,0)">Their effect on lending is what makes NPLs a problem that reaches beyond the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The euro area economy mostly relies on banks as a source of credit – much more so than many other economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is particularly true for small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the EU, SMEs account for more than 50% of value added and more than 60% of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Altogether, 99% of all enterprises are small and medium-sized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The three most important sources of financing for SMEs are bank loans, leasing and credit lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">So they do rely heavily on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.04,0)">This makes them somewhat vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In crises, banks tend to charge higher premiums when lending to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And, as an ECB study shows, this premium is in turn partly driven by the amount of NPLs on a bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.9,0)">The more NPLs a bank holds, the less it lends to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.88,0)">So, it was clear from the start that NPLs were not just a problem for banks and their supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.15,0)">Other national and European authorities had to act as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As for us supervisors, dealing with NPLs is a core task!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">We benefited from our European point of view, from being free of national traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">We drew, for instance, on the experience of countries such as Ireland which had already successfully dealt with NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And we were able to compare and draw lessons from the different legal and judicial environments in 19 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Building on all these insights, we developed a harmonised European supervisory approach for tackling NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This was not easy, though, as we met with considerable pushback.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">But we nevertheless moved ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">After first taking stock, we pursued a two-pronged approach from 2015 onwards: first, directly addressing legacy NPLs; second, preventing new NPLs from piling up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">On this basis, we devised a harmonised approach that rests on three pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The first pillar is qualitative guidance to banks on how to develop and implement strategies to reduce NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">These strategies should contain targets for reducing NPLs at the portfolio level over a three-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But our guidance simply outlines best practices in devising the strategies and lists tools for implementing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">As no two banks are alike, each bank needs to pursue an individual strategy and meet individual reduction targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It goes without saying that we diligently monitor their progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The second pillar is a quantitative addendum to this guidance, in which we specify our supervisory expectations for the provisioning of new NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These expectations depend on the extent to which NPLs are secured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">For fully unsecured exposures and unsecured parts of partially secured exposures, we expect banks to achieve 100% coverage within two years after a loan has been classified as non-performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.28,0)">For secured NPLs, the limit is seven years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The third pillar is a framework to address the stock of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Within this framework, we formulate, for each bank, our expectations regarding the provisioning of legacy NPLs, bearing in mind the general expectations on provisions that I just outlined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Our assessment of each bank’s implementation of our qualitative and quantitative guidance is part of our bank-specific Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, or SREP for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">At the same time, an action plan to tackle NPLs was developed at the political level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This plan set out the need for action in three areas: first, banking supervision; second, insolvency and debt recovery frameworks; and third, secondary markets for distressed debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">And since 2015, we have made real progress in bringing down the level of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.73,0)">The volume of NPLs has declined by almost €400 billion since that year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.83,0)">The average NPL ratio now stands at just over 4%, around €600 billion in absolute terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">So things are improving significantly, but there is still some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">NPLs are among the biggest challenges facing banks in the euro area; it is essential that banks complete the clean-up of their balance sheets as long as the sun is shining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.22,0)">But banks and supervisors cannot focus solely on the past, on legacy assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We must also look to the future and watch out for the risks that are still beyond the horizon or just appearing on the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">While I have just praised the banking union as a major step towards a united Europe, one country is about to take a step in the opposite direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.66,0)">Brexit is about to happen – or so it seems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.19,0)">The official date for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is 29 March 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.42,0)">As of today, however, it is still unclear how this will happen – if it happens at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.5,0)">The worst scenario would be a Brexit without any agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU on their future relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Despite all the uncertainty, one thing is clear: Brexit will change the shape of the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the first place, the large number of banks that are located in the United Kingdom and do business in the EU will have to find new ways of accessing the European market after Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And this is relevant for us supervisors, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Over the past two years, we have clearly set out what we expect from banks relocating to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We have published information on our website; we have talked about the issue in interviews and speeches; and we have had intense discussions directly with the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">We have urged and pushed them to prepare for all potential outcomes of the political process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">At present, most banks relocating to the euro area have made reasonable progress in preparing their move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.71,0)">But it’s not just banks located in the United Kingdom that will be hit by Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Euro area banks rely, for instance, very much on central counterparties, or CCPs, in the United Kingdom to clear derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">With Brexit, they might lose access to these services, and this might disrupt their business and the markets, and in turn threaten financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.79,0)">The European Commission has acknowledged the problem and plans to take temporary measures to preserve access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.02,0)">While this is certainly good news, it is merely a stopgap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There is no time to relax; there is just a little more time to prepare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Now, Brexit at least offers an opportunity to think about CCPs and concentration risk in more general terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The market for clearing is highly concentrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">While I do see the benefits in terms of efficiency, I also see the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And this is something we definitely need to discuss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I have now focused on two challenges that are more or less European: NPLs and Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.06,0)">There are, of course, many more challenges, and these affect banks not only in Europe but worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.05,0)">There are geopolitical uncertainties, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">It seems that nationalism and, thus, protectionism, is on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.73,0)">In the long run this will hurt the economy and everyone will be worse off, including those who appear to benefit from protectionist measures at first glance; the current trade tensions are a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.74,0)">Then there are financial market risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.3,0)">Interest rates are low and liquidity is still abundant and cheap, but these conditions will not last forever; there is the risk of a snapback in markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At the same time, technological progress might change the business of banking and the structure of the sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.59,0)">This could be an opportunity; but it may also be a risk if banks fail to adapt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Risks from the inside – governance, culture and ethics Ladies and gentlemen, banks have to deal with many risks these days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And while it seems that the risks have grown, it should be clear that risks are an inherent part of a bank’s business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In fact, what distinguishes a good bank from a bad bank is how it deals with risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.28,0)">And in this regard, the enemy all too often comes from within.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">After all, banks are managed by people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.08,0)">And people make mistakes from time to time; they are often biased when taking decisions under uncertainty and some people have skewed ethics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.25,0)">The result can be bad risk management or even outright misconduct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.09,0)">Neither is acceptable and each can damage the reputation of a bank, drive away its customers and diminish its capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.15,0)">Each can bring down a bank and harm others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.97,0)">For policymakers, issues of misconduct can bring additional challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Money laundering is a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.87,0)">Recent cases have shown that it often reaches across borders and requires different authorities to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.15,0)">In Europe, national authorities are in charge of anti-money laundering, AML for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB has no AML mandate, but as European banking supervisors we also have to take relevant risks into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We do so, for instance, when we assess acquisitions of qualifying holdings, or when we assess whether banks’ managers are fit for their jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Prompted by the recent scandals, European policymakers have now taken several initiatives, one of their aims being to strengthen the cooperation between national AML authorities and European banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For instance, new European legislation provides that the ECB and national AML authorities exchange relevant information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To better integrate findings from national AML authorities in prudential supervision, ECB Banking Supervision is setting up an AML coordination function which will have three main roles: to handle interactions with national AML authorities, raise supervisors’ awareness about money laundering risks in banks, and be a centre of expertise on prudential AML topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.47,0)">But AML is just one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">More generally, good governance, with the right checks and balances in place, can keep such problems from emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.81,0)">Governance has been neglected by regulators and supervisors for far too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I see it as a crucial topic for the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For European banking supervision, governance is a key issue – and has been from the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The quality of a bank’s governance is one of the four pillars of our SREP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">How could we judge a bank to be safe and sound without assessing its governance framework?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As part of our SREP, we also assess the banks’ risk appetite frameworks, their RAFs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We look at whether banks are fully integrating the policies, processes, controls, systems and procedures set out in their RAF into their decision-making processes and their risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We also assess whether their RAF is aligned with their business plans, strategies, capital planning and remuneration schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Easier said than done, as I’m sure you know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We do not look at banks in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As I just mentioned, benchmarking is a key supervisory tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We carry out horizontal analyses on a host of issues, including governance, which was the subject of a thematic review we published in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, all of this is still work in progress – for supervisors and for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.13,0)">That banks are not yet where they should be becomes clear when we look at the recent scandals in the headlines: money laundering, tax evasion, manipulation of rates and prices – you are no doubt familiar with these cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">They are not confined to a single region, nor to a single bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">While good governance can take banks a long way in behaving responsibly, we have to dig deeper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.99,0)">Ultimately, ethical behaviour is either helped or hindered by a bank’s culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.42,0)">So we do not want to see a culture that tolerates misconduct or even encourages it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.63,0)">But it is not in a supervisor’s power to shape a bank’s culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Ultimately, the onus is on the banks and their stakeholders to bring about a cultural shift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The first step is to understand that staying in business for the long term is more important than ramping up profits in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In that sense, a good reputation is worth more than a dodgy deal – no matter how much profit that deal promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Shareholders, too, should focus more on the sustainability of a bank’s business model, and thus their investment, and less on receiving as high a dividend as possible in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This understanding is only the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">The culture of a bank is shaped both ways, top-down and bottom-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The management of a bank plays an important role in setting the tone and defining expected behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.21,0)">But this is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">When it comes to culture, action speaks louder than words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">Staff will take the behaviour of management as a cue of what is acceptable and what not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Managers have to lead not only by words but by example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Incentives are another important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.36,0)">Staff will know which behaviour earns them a bonus or gets them promoted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">That’s why European banking supervisors assess remuneration schemes, including the extent to which integrity matters in promotions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">More generally, integrity is one of the five criteria we apply when conducting fit and proper assessments of potential bank managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And this is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.78,0)">Culture tends to be self-perpetuating, because people with certain values tend to hire people who hold the same values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">Breaking this cycle is difficult, but necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But simply hiring people with different values and perspectives will not suffice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">They then must be encouraged to speak up – to call foul when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Here, we supervisors can help again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The ECB has set up a breach-reporting mechanism through which whistle-blowers can share information with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Last year, we received more than 120 reports, an increase of about 40% from 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So, there are things that can be done, but we should not expect miracles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.32,0)">Culture is a sticky thing that tends to change very slowly.</span><span
