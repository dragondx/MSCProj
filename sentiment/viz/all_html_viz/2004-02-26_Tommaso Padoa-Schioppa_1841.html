    <span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)"> Building on the euro’s success Luncheon Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa,Member of the Governing Council and Executive Board of the European Central Bank,delivered at the Conference: "The Euro at Five: Ready for a Global Role?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">"organised by the Institute for International Economics,Washington DC, 26 February 2004 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen: “Building on the euro’s success” is the title the organisers suggested for my speech today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">With this title, I could be tempted to indulge in describing such important achievements as the smooth introduction of the new currency, the maintenance of price stability, and the growing international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.54,0)">Important as they are, however, we should not forget that such achievements are means to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The end is to enhance economic prosperity in a stable and safe environment, and to do so both in Europe and worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Indeed, in an increasingly globalised world we cannot take a domestic perspective only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Spillovers between different countries and regions are so powerful and frequent that prosperity and stability can be achieved and preserved domestically only if they are at the same time safeguarded globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In my remarks, I would like to present the euro’s success in this broader perspective, and discuss how Europe can help meeting the challenges faced by the global economy today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me state clearly upfront what I see as the euro’s three main elements of success in this perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">First, European Monetary Union – or, in short: the euro – has granted monetary stability to an economic area that constitutes the world’s largest trading partner and had been for very long an area of instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Second, it has helped anchor policies in its region, and most particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, thereby contributing to guiding one of the most profound processes of economic transformation the world has experienced in many decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">And third, the euro is contributing to global adjustment patterns with an active and constructive commitment to the principles of the post-Bretton Woods global, multilateral arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">The domestic dimension Let me start with the domestic dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.85,0)">European Monetary Union has put an end to Europe being an area of monetary tensions, exchange rate crises, and macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">It has turned it into an area of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Not only has it eliminated exchange rate disruptions among the participating countries, but it has also established an environment of low long-term interest rates throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.17,0)">Long-term rates have declined by about five percentage points from 1994 to the start of the single monetary policy in January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.13,0)">At the same time, interest rate dispersion has virtually disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Given the weight of the euro area in the world economy, this has contributed to global stability in a significant way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Success was not guaranteed from the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Rather it was dependent on the degree of confidence the euro would inspire among the over 300 million euro area citizens when they use it as a means of payment, a store of value and a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Five years ago the Eurosystem had still to prove its capability to build and maintain such confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">At that time, some sceptical observers predicted that inflation expectations and outcomes in the euro area would rise again once the beneficial effects of the convergence process would ebb away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Others argued that the quality of the new currency would correspond just to some average of all legacy currencies, rather than to the benchmark set by the strongest ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.84,0)">We can say now that both views turned out to be wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The Eurosystem has been successful in keeping inflation and inflation expectations stable and anchored to its very demanding definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The euro has also been a central element of the integration process among EU members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">For example, it has enhanced competition across borders and acted as a catalyst for structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">All these are very important achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.89,0)">Yet, when speaking about economic success, I am acutely aware that Europe is far from meeting one key requirement of success, namely combining price stability with healthy rates of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is indeed a crucial issue, to which I shall come back when talking about the global dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The regional dimension Let me now turn to the second element of success: the anchoring role for policies in Central and Eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The prospect of joining the European Union and eventually the euro area has been crucial in guiding the fundamental economic change implied in the transition from a command to a market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This prospect has also fostered macroeconomic stability in the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In about two months from now, 75 million people will join the European Union, and the euro will ultimately become their currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The path towards full monetary integration of the new entrants is clearly laid out and will be implemented as they progress in convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Many of the benefits are already visible now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Trade integration has already fully occurred, and many of the prospective new Member States are trading as much with the current EU members as those members are doing among themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Financial integration is also highly advanced, through the ownership links between EU commercial banks and the banking systems in Central and Eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.31,0)">As for nominal convergence, inflation rates five years ago were still at 10 per cent in the region and had declined to 2 per cent by last year, without economic growth suffering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">As a matter of fact, several of the new entrants are closer to meeting the numerical Maastricht criteria today than the current euro area members were five years before the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This means that the prospect of euro adoption has already helped anchor policies in this part of the global economy and is entrenching progress in transition, integration, and nominal convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Of course, the impressive progress in nominal convergence should not hide the enormous task of real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">The purchasing power per head in the prospective Member States is only about half of that in the current EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The major challenge is indeed catching up in terms of prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But the conditions are in place for these countries to grow by more than 5 per cent per year for many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This would be in line with the experience of regions and countries such as the South of Germany, the North-East of Italy or Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The main challenge for new Member States will thus be to preserve and strengthen nominal convergence while succeeding in the real catching up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The anchoring effect of the euro in the region neighbouring the euro area goes, however, well beyond the scope of prospective new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The EU has significantly tightened its economic, financial and institutional links with many countries surrounding it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The EU enlargement is the best-known example, but there is also the Stabilisation and Association Process with the countries of the Western Balkans; the Barcelona Process with Mediterranean countries; and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements with countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, notably Russia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Indeed, from an institutional point of view, current developments in Europe represent an expansion of the cooperation framework that has characterised the European integration process since the early 1950s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.72,0)">The euro is, of course, only part of this whole process, but not a minor one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In terms of official use, most of the roughly fifty countries for which the euro is - in various degrees of intensity - an anchor or a reference currency are located in the immediate geographical neighbourhood of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In particular, I refer to the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and the Balkans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In terms of private use, the euro is an important financing currency for borrowers and a major vehicle currency in foreign exchange markets in countries close to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In addition, a significant use of the euro as a parallel currency can be observed in EU neighbouring regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Global dimension Turning now to the global dimension, the euro has well established itself as the second international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In some areas, in particular in international financial markets, its importance has grown over the last five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Financial institutions and non-financial corporations, in particular from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, have taken advantage of the greater size and liquidity provided by the increasingly integrated euro bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As a result, the share of the euro in the stock of international debt securities has risen from about 20 per cent in 1999 to more than 30 in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In other areas, the international role of the euro has remained relatively stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">An example is the foreign exchange market, where the share of the euro in foreign exchange transactions today is not significantly bigger than that of the Deutsche Mark in the past, accounting for about one-quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Beyond this rather specific role, however, what matters most is the contribution the euro provides to global monetary and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This contribution consists in the euro area’s constructive participation in the post-Bretton Woods arrangements, and in its active commitment to multilateral cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this point, because I think that in this area we are now confronted with a most pressing issue, namely how to achieve the adjustment of the large global imbalances as smoothly as possible, avoiding - or at least minimising - negative effects on global economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">What should the euro and the euro area do to meet this challenge?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">To answer this question, I would refer to four key features of the post-Bretton Woods regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, no single currency performs the anchoring role for the other major currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Second, exchange rates are determined by market forces and ought to be in line with economic fundamentals; as such, their movements are expected to contribute to the adjustment of external imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.99,0)">Third, as exchange rate markets may be very volatile and may produce disorderly moves among the major currencies, occasional public action through verbal or, in some special circumstances, market intervention might be undertaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Fourth, the appropriate framework for international cooperation is a multilateral one, mainly through the G7 and the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Let me say that the euro area’s policy is fully consistent with these four key features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Exchange rate developments enter into the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, together with all pertinent economic variables, to the extent that they have a bearing on its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We respect the fact that the exchange rate of the euro is essentially market determined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB has - on very few occasions over the past five years - made its view clear about specific developments in the exchange rate of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.68,0)">For instance, we have recently observed that the current magnitudes of exchange rate swings could create momentum and excessive volatility in financial markets that might become unwarranted by economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It is by accepting the logic of the post-Bretton Woods regime, that Europe has fully supported the adjustment process over the last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It has done so in spite of the fact that Europe is not contributing – in either way – to the gravity of present global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As part of this adjustment process, the euro has appreciated against the US dollar by about 46 per cent since March 2002, with more than one third of this   concentrated in the last six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Perhaps even more striking, the euro has appreciated by virtually the same percentages on average vis-à-vis the currencies of Japan, China, Korea and other main Asian economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">This is due to the link these currencies have maintained with the US Dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Such an appreciation is striking if one considers how strong competitors these economies already were before depreciating and how large their external surpluses are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">From experience we know that to bring large external imbalances back on a sustainable path, changes are required both in prices and quantities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.3,0)">The exchange rate alone is not sufficient; growth differentials must also adjust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">And here is where lies the main challenge for Europe today: the challenge is to increase its potential and actual growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">For the world economy not to slow down, it will be necessary, in the years to come, to step up European growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.06,0)">Over the past decade, real GDP in the euro area grew at the disappointingly low rate of 2 per cent per year, whereas in the United States it exceeded 3 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">I am always struck by admiration when I think that in this country actual growth has exceeded potential growth for six of the last seven years of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Even if one considers that part of the EU-US growth differential is attributable to a difference in demographic trends, the extraordinary performance of the US economy remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.0,0)">Not only growth potential is relatively low in Europe, also the actual growth performance is persistently falling short of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In this moment positive chances of recovery seem to lie ahead, such as the establishment of macroeconomic stability and very low interest rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Moreover, important structural rigidities have been dismantled in recent years, and the integration of ten new catching-up economies is an implicit promise for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.47,0)">However, there is no room for complacency: Europe is still well away from its aim to become a fully competitive and dynamic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Only by sigininficantly stepping up its own growth performance will Europe complete its contibution to overcoming the challenge facing the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">But I think that there is yet another, not less relevant European contribution to the good functioning of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This is to strengthen the multilateral character of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">To this end Europe can build on its success in applying multilateralism to its regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.87,0)">A close look at the origins of the current imbalances suggests that they have emerged – at least partly – from a policy environment characterised by a degree unilateralism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me briefly explain what I mean by this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As we know, the reserve build-up in Asia has become the main source of financing of the US current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This unprecedented build-up has been motivated to a significant extent by the desire to protect the economy against external shocks and by the pursuit of a growth strategy that was largely export led.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The pursuit of such a strategy is understandable, as it combines domestic development with international integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">After all, Europe had followed a similar path in the 1950s and 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">However, a policy in which the countries peg, or tightly manage, their currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar implies that the latter becomes the informal common monetary standard in the region and vis-àvis the outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Actually, although regional economic integration has recently risen in Asia, monetary issues have not yet become part of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">For some years, a policy of unilateral pegs was benefiting all parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The US were able to finance fiscal and current account deficits in an environment of low interest rates despite a falling dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Asian countries received strong growth impulses, and some even welcomed the build-up in reserves as a further measure to fight deflationary tendencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">However, one may wonder how long this mutually beneficial outcome will last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Indeed, over the last months there have increasingly been, particularly on the side of US authorities, calls for more flexibility in Asia’s exchange rate management with a view of leading to some orderly and progressive appreciation of emerging Asia currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The G7 statement of Boca Raton in February is pointing in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The adjustment of global imbalances is a delicate process, which has a global and multilateral character even when such imbalances are not evenly distributed across the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.44,0)">At the same time, we should be aware of the fragility and incompleteness of the system of open trade we have constructed over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.41,0)">I know of no country where the constituency of protectionism takes long vacations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Recently, there have been suggestions in some quarters, both in the EU and the US, in favour of protectionist measures to tackle increasing competition by Asian countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">By mentioning this, I would like to stress that in an increasingly globalised economy, the preservation and strengthening of a satisfactory multilateral framework is crucially important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.69,0)">As a European, I am aware that the move towards exchange rates more in line with underlying fundamentals can be difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is all the more true, when exchange rate policies not only bear on trade and financial relations with the anchor country, but also on those with important trading partners in the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.34,0)">But at the same time, and against the background of the European experience, I venture to say that it will be difficult to secure progress in economic and financial integration - both within Asia as well as between Asia and the rest of the world - without addressing at some point the monetary dimension of such cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Conclusions Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">You have noticed that in speaking about the euro’s success, I have said relatively little about the achievements of introducing a single currency for 12 sovereign nations, the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, and the euro’s gradually increasing international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I have said relatively little about these issues as I regard them as necessary foundations for the euro’s success but not as its essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my view, the essence lies deeper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It lies in having brought stability to Europe, both in the euro area and its neighbouring regions, in contributing to global adjustment through a commitment to exchange rate arrangements fully consistent with the post-Bretton Woods setting, and sticking to principles of multilateral cooperation that are applicable at the regional as well as global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">It is in these areas where the euro contributes to a more efficient and stable international monetary system, and it is also here where we have to continue to work in order to improve the functioning of this system further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Domestically, in fostering sustainable growth in the euro area, and globally in working towards a framework that accompanies globalisation in the real economy sphere with an appropriate framework in the monetary sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The positive experience of the euro reminds us that a multilateral framework is the best choice to make.</span>
