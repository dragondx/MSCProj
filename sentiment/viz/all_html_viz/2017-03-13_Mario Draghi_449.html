    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)"> Moving to the Frontier: Promoting the Diffusion of Innovation Welcome address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the joint conference by the ECB and the MIT Lab for Innovation Science and Policy “Fostering Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Euro area”, Frankfurt am Main, 13 March 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you to this joint ECB-MIT conference on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">This might at first glance seem an unusual topic for a central bank conference, since monetary policy principally operates through the demand side of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.81,0)">But the long-term supply picture evidently also affects our ability to deliver on our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Much of the debate today about the true level of the real equilibrium interest rate, for example, is a debate about the outlook for productivity growth, which of course depends in large part on innovation and entrepreneurship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Higher productivity growth is also vital to safeguard Europe’s economic model of high wages and social protection, and hence to counter the sense of economic insecurity that is currently prevalent in several advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But aggregate productivity growth is more than just the development and application of innovation and new technologies which enhance or even revolutionise production processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">New technologies invented elsewhere need to be adapted by firms into their own production processes to make them more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In short, productivity growth depends not only on the creation of new ideas, but also on their diffusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">To raise productivity growth, which has slowed in the euro area and in many other economies in recent years, we need to focus on both areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.32,0)">Innovation There is a lively debate underway as to whether the rate of innovation has slowed or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Some argue that the great innovations of the past – electricity, railways, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">– will not be matched in the future,  or that we have exhausted the gains from the information and communication technology   revolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.02,0)">Others remain more optimistic that the current slowdown in productivity reflects a transition to a knowledge-based economy, and that general purpose technologies such as ICT improve over time and generate complementary innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">My view on the topic is that we should not be overly gloomy about the global prospects for innovation, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The first is that we clearly have potential to boost innovative capacity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.16,0)">Consider, for example, the persistent gap between R&D spending in Europe and other major advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Indicator, only three euro area countries are in the world’s top ten for innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">So if, as the world’s second-largest economic area, we were to dismantle barriers to innovative activity in the euro area, it would clearly give a boost to global innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.43,0)">I will not go into detail here about what policies this might entail, but clearly government support for innovation matters: in Europe differences in innovative capacity between countries are closely related to public spending on R&D, particularly in basic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.13,0)">The second reason why I am reasonably optimistic is that there is no clear evidence yet of a slowdown in innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.61,0)">The available data in terms of global R&D spending, and the ongoing historically high rate of high-tech patent registrations seem to challenge this perception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Moreover, despite the global slowdown in aggregate productivity, firms at the global productivity frontier have continued to post strong productivity gains over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The performance of euro area businesses at the global frontier is on a par with businesses in other developed economies, particularly in manufacturing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.47,0)">It is the performance of firms away from the frontier that has been lagging  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.87,0)">Although this is a common feature for all OECD countries, it is particularly the case for euro area services, where productivity growth for the laggard firms has stagnated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Manufacturing industries are then aggregated with value added shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Service industries are then aggregated with value added shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.25,0)">Diffusion It seems, therefore, that a large contributing factor to the slowdown in aggregate productivity is the second link in the chain: the lack of diffusion of innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.55,0)">This is a long-standing issue for the euro area: better adoption of ICT in the United States appears to explain most of the productivity gap between the US and the EU15 from 1995 to 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The contribution to aggregate productivity growth from non-ICT sources of capital deepening and total factor productivity   growth over that period was broadly equivalent in the two regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">But what is now becoming clearer is where the diffusion gaps lie.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.5,0)">Recent work carried out by the ECB using micro data shows that the difference in productivity between the most productive and the least productive firms in each narrow, two-digit sector is considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The top 10% of firms, in terms of productivity, are on average three times more productive than the firms in the bottom 10%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Similar differentials occur in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.37,0)">This massive intra-industry productivity differential dwarfs inter-industry differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">For comparison, firms active in the tradable sector are on average around 50% more productive than those producing mainly non-tradables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">et al  : “Assessing European competitiveness: the new CompNet micro-based database”, Working Paper Series, No 1764, ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">Non-tradable sectors include: construction, hotels and restaurants, and professional and administrative services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The within-sector 90th percentile/10th percentile productivity ratio is aggregated to the country level using sector shares in total value added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.12,0)">The “old” EU countries are Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Portugal and Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The “new” EU countries are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">How, then, can we improve the diffusion of innovation from the frontier to the laggard firms, especially within sectors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Research suggests three main areas that will improve the capacity of, and incentives for, firms to adopt new technology:   investing in human capital and managerial ability,   investment in intangibles, and   improving economic dynamism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Investment in human capital and management First, there is now an extensive literature on the complementarities between technology and workforce skills, and on how better human capital increases the capacity to absorb technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.62,0)">Human capital includes not just formal education, but also on-the-job training and job security – firms with a large proportion of workers on temporary contracts underperform in terms of innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Managerial ability is also key for the adoption of technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">New technologies often require new structures and a reorganisation of production to maximise efficiency gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">While managerial quality is hard to quantify, the existing studies find a statistically strong correlation between a firm’s managerial quality and its total factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">One of the channels through which managerial practices enhance firm performance has been found to be the increased capability of firms to absorb new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Certainly there is potential to improve education systems in the euro area and thereby to give greater numbers of graduates the necessary technical and scientific skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Our co-hosts today, MIT, came top of the latest QS world university rankings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are nine UK universities and two Swiss universities in the top 50 of those rankings, but only one euro area university.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And education is not just for the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Improving the provision of life-long learning and retraining programmes will aid the flow of skilled labour towards more productive businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Investment in intangibles Second, numerous studies have shown that firms which invest more in intangibles are in a better position to understand and benefit from new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such investment includes conducting their own R&D and developing their own intellectual property, as well as investment in branding, software and databases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.55,0)">Investment in intangibles also appears low in the euro area compared with a number of other advanced economies, although it has been on an upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.24,0)">The aggregate number also masks a wide country-level disparity, with the lack of intangibles investment particularly acute in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Increasing the resources devoted to R&D would improve the ability of euro area firms to absorb more innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Economic dynamism The third main factor increasing absorptive capacity is the framework in which the business operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Greater economic dynamism, from competition to higher rates of business entry, plays an important role in incentivising firms to adopt new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Ensuring that failed firms are able to smoothly exit the market is also key to enabling capital and labour to be allocated to where it can be more productively used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.87,0)">Business churn – the combined rate of business formation and closure – has been declining in Europe and the United States since just before the crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">In lock step with the decline in churn, evidence suggests that capital misallocation has been rising in both regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.74,0)">Depending on the country it can take between four days and almost a month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Yet in the global best performer – New Zealand – it is possible to set up a business in less than a day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.18,0)">There are barriers as well to the orderly exit of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.1,0)">Resolving insolvency takes an average of almost two years in the euro area, three times longer than in the best three performing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">This is why we talk frequently about the need for structural reforms of regulatory and judicial processes to bolster business dynamism, as well as the need to complete the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.58,0)">This is especially true in services, where the laggard firms are noticeably behind the frontier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.05,0)">Of course, creating the right regulatory framework and market conditions to nurture innovation and promote its transformation into new products and processes is complex, and there is no particular established winning formula.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">But there are a number of countries in the euro area that have proven relatively more successful at putting in place an effective “innovation ecosystem”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">One of the aims of this conference is to investigate international and euro area best practice and facilitate the sharing of that knowledge with countries where an effective ecosystem has yet to be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.77,0)">There are many reasons why it is a priority today in the euro area to address weak productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But while some progress can be made in innovation, it is not in my view the sole issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">It is equally important for the euro area to facilitate and encourage the spread of new technology from the frontier to the laggard firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Simply by diffusing better the technology we already have in the euro area, we could make sizeable gains in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In other words, there is much we can still do to reverse the aggregate productivity slowdown and dispel pessimism about our future.</span><span style="background-color:
