    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.34,0)"> A failure of capitalism?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.94,0)">Distinguish lecture by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the inauguration academic year 2009/2010 “Centro di Ricerca sul Cabiamento Politico”, Università di Siena,Siena, 16 October 2009 Since the financial crisis erupted, there has been no lack of opportunity to put on trial the people presumed responsible for the upheavals of recent times: the bankers for taking excessive risks; the regulators for not supervising the bankers; the rating agencies for mispricing the risks; the central bankers for creating too much cheap money; the economists for not foreseeing the crisis; the journalists for turning that crisis into a drama.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Such calls to account may be useful to understand what went wrong and what must be done to put the system right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.91,0)">But as it’s tempting to regard all of them as culprits, each of them can then escape the blame, and the accusing finger turns to the system itself: it’s capitalism that’s at fault.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.79,0)">The system can be improved – and many initiatives are under way to that end – but it includes inherently unstable elements that we have to live with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">One example of this position is reflected in a comment made to the BBC by Alan Greenspan, the former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve: “ The crisis will happen again but it will be different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">Crises are all different, but they have one fundamental source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">That is the unquenchable capability of human beings when confronted with long periods of prosperity to presume that it will continue”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In other words, it’s human nature to drive fast, over the limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.64,0)">So accidents are inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">You can only try to make them less serious by fitting stronger brakes in cars, or by giving them airbags or by improving the roads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This analogy is frequently used to explain the financial crisis and to suggest that since we can’t really avoid new crises, we should rather try to reduce their impact and enhance our defences by having tougher regulations and more effective supervisory mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.36,0)">In his book ‘A Failure of Capitalism’, Richard Posner   – one of the leading ideologues and advocates of the free market – offers a critique of the capitalist system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.33,0)">In his view, the root of the crisis lies in the explosive mix of an expansive monetary policy and excessive deregulation – a mix that has caused financial operators to take risks of a magnitude greater than they could manage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But Posner goes one step further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.38,0)">He claims that those who made the misjudgements, in particular financial operators, knew that what they were doing was very risky, and could even lead to a crisis, although they weren’t able to estimate its scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.14,0)">Posner writes: “ I do not believe that the financial crisis is the result of stupidity or irrationality, criminality or even ignorance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.89,0)">I think that even most of the consumers who bought houses with mortgages they could not “afford” knew what they were doing – speculating not unreasonably on a continued rise in house prices.” And he adds : “I believe that the senior executives of the major banks were aware that there might be at least a small probability of bankruptcy as a result of the risks they were taking”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.0,0)">Alan Greenspan, who must have known many of these senior executives, seems to be of the same opinion, for in that same BBC interview he said: “ The bankers knew that they were involved in an under-pricing of risk and that at some point a correction would be made”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This view seems to be confirmed by the memorable comment made by Chuck Prince, former Chairman and CEO of Citigroup, in the summer of 2007, just a few days before the crisis broke: “As long as the music is playing, we’ve got to get up and dance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We’re still dancing”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This remark – which I believe is not only symptomatic of the crisis but also key to understanding it – has often been quoted but perhaps not sufficiently analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.28,0)">It seems to support Posner’s argument that the managers of the big banks knew they had taken major risks and ventured into activities rather like the game of musical chairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.55,0)">Those managers were well aware that, sooner or later, the music would stop and the race for the remaining chairs would start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.19,0)">They didn’t know how many chairs would be left or how far away they would be from them – all they knew was that at some time the music would finish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Evidently, each of them expected, or hoped, to beat the others to a chair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.47,0)">Why were they so confident?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.19,0)">Their expectations were based on the assumption that the most profitable financial institutions would also be the most resistant to any abrupt stopping of the ‘music’ – an assumption linked to the yardstick by which they were measured in the financial sector, in other words, profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">One bank is more capable than another, and thus worth more, if it earns more than another, not in the space of five or six years, but in a period of three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">A trader is more capable than another if he earns more for his bank and, as a result, earns more for himself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">A bank   which made large profits in the past would feel justified to regard itself as being more capable than the others and would continue to think like that even if it foresaw the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.36,0)">It did not consider, or did not want to consider, that its profits were larger than those of the other banks because it had taken more risks – risks that would slow it down in its rush for the empty chair when the music stopped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">There’s another interesting detail in Chuck Prince’s comment – his use of the verb “got to”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.65,0)">Prince seems to be suggesting that there are no alternatives, as if some external force is pushing him and his bank, along with the others, to take more and more risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It seems difficult to believe, but not that difficult after all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In her book ‘Fool’s Gold’, Gillian Tett   explains how the continual comparison of the results of various banks, and even inside the banks between the various teams – results based on profits obtained – encouraged the banks and employees to take ever greater risks in order to obtain better results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Reporting on an internal discussion at an investment bank, Tett writes: “2005 had been another record year for the banking world: the largest investment banks had collectively raised their revenues by 31% to USD 289 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.45,0)">In that time, however, JPMorgan Chase had produced only a modest result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.87,0)">So what should JPMorgan do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.77,0)">Was it time for the bank to reconsider entering the mortgage CDO and CDS game?”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This quote confirms that the bankers were well aware that if they wanted to make their bank more profitable they had to increase the degree of risk, to “join the game”, in other words, to enter the casino.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">We should not make the mistake of considering that such a perverse system of incentives is limited to the banking world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In the end, it’s the shareholders and savers who demand better returns on their investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It’s the savers, both large and small, who want their fund managers, be they banks, pension funds or investment funds, to beat the competition, and the benchmark is the rate of return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.46,0)">If their savings bring poorer returns than others, then they will invest them where the returns are higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">The fund managers will try to anticipate such shifts, replacing their less effective personnel with those who obtain better results, even if they take greater risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.46,0)">Profit maximisation by entrepreneurs is what drives capitalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It is the best way to reward investment and thereby promote long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">This assumption underlies the theoretical models we use to analyse economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is also consistent with the kind of human incentive that Greenspan and Posner were referring to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The literature has analysed how perfect competition in the product and labour markets ensures that the benefits of growth are distributed among all market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.76,0)">In an ideal world with perfect competition the profit on marginal investments tends to zero, as all resources are fully exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">However, we know that in reality we do not have fully competitive markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">Indeed, sometimes even the entrepreneurs themselves take strong action to prevent markets from operating under conditions of perfect competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In their book ‘Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists’,   Rajan and Zingales explain well the inherent contradiction of a market economy, namely that entrepreneurs can benefit from regulation that reduces competition and maximises their rent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The entrepreneurs thus have an incentive to lobby the legislator to adopt regulation aimed at increasing the barriers to entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.17,0)">Such legislation tends to redistribute welfare from consumers to producers, but also reduces overall demand and investment and thus economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.56,0)">Excessive regulation, aimed at safeguarding inefficient monopolistic rents, can cause an economy to stagnate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This leads Rajan and Zingales to argue that, for capitalism to produce all its benefits, it must put up strong barriers, also at the political level, to that reflex of capitalists to over-regulate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">These barriers encouraged the wave of de-regulation which spread through advanced and emerging market economies as from the mid-1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The same reasoning has been applied to finance – maybe without understanding that financial services are quite special, and different from other products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.01,0)">This difference has become even more difficult to understand during the crisis, as some – like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel – have asked: “ Why is it when I buy a product I know what I am buying, but when I buy a financial product I do not know?”   Many of us have probably wondered this when trying to understand what caused this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The answer is twofold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">Firstly, if you buy a financial product you are, by definition, buying risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">If you only want to preserve the nominal value of your savings, you should just hold cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The return on an investment compensates you for the inherent risk of the asset you acquire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.96,0)">In other words, the value of a financial instrument is uncertain because it is subject to risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The greater the risk, the greater the return should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">The second part of the answer is that it is not always easy to assess risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">Anyone who enters into a transaction should make his or her own assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.92,0)">That may vary not only because of the probability of a specific event, such as the default of the counterparty, but also because of the probability of other events, affecting for instance the other assets held in the portfolio of an investor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.99,0)">But, more importantly, the buyer and seller may value the risk of an asset differently because they might have different information about the asset itself, and its characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.87,0)">In particular the seller – by which I mean the originator – of the asset tends to have more information than the buyer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If the former can hide some of the information, in particular about the risk of the asset, he can sell it at a higher price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">In other words, the rate of return will not cover the intrinsic risk of the asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is where the difference between financial products and other products is relevant, not only for individuals but also for society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Earlier I mentioned that, in a world of perfect competition an industry should attract investment, and thus grow until marginal profits are brought down to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This assumes that both the seller and buyer are able to assess the price of the good or service exchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">If the buyer believes that the good is of higher quality than it really is he or she will buy a larger quantity, for a given price, and thus increase the sales and profits of the company selling the product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In other words, if an investor thinks that a financial asset is less risky than it really is, he or she will buy a higher amount, and the profits of the financial industry will increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This means that the more the risk is undervalued by investors, the greater the profit opportunities for the financial industry are, and the greater the scope for further expanding in particular through financial innovation, which may hide the inherent asymmetry of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Pushing the argument further, in a competitive environment there are incentives for the financial industry to increase the asymmetry of information – it can increase its revenues and profits that way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.7,0)">To sum up, a market economy has a natural tendency to produce and consume financial assets to an excessive degree, and that may destabilise the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.23,0)">The key difference, again, compared with the other sectors of the economy, is the inherent asymmetry of information which underlies the relationship between producers and consumers of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is why   regulation is needed to preserve sound and stable financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.55,0)">The financiers’ incentives are diametrically opposed to those of the capitalists considered by Rajan and Zingales.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">For the latter, the more regulation there is, the better, because it protects the incumbents from external competition, and thus maximises their monopolistic rents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The incumbents are ready to lobby the regulators and legislators to increase the regulatory barriers, to protect their rents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The regulatory pressure will only abate if the potential external competitors and consumers can mobilise sufficient resources and forces to counter such lobbying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.82,0)">In the financial industry, it’s the other way round.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The outsiders, who are not subject to regulation, can become more profitable than the insiders if they are able to sell to investors high-risk assets with returns which appear to offer disproportionate rewards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.01,0)">Financial regulation does not protect the incumbents from outside competition, unlike in other industries, but instead prevents the insiders from conducting more profitable – and more risky – business practices that the outsiders can perform in the non-regulated sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I will not consider in detail why the non-regulated financial sector has grown to become more profitable than the regulated one, the opposite of what should happen in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.19,0)">Asymmetric information is again at the heart of the matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">In the real economy the inventor of a product can protect his intellectual property and investment in production by seeking a copyright.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Production, distribution and sales can be planned on the basis of such protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.92,0)">In the financial system there is no such a thing as copyright.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.13,0)">No product can be protected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.54,0)">No copyrights exist for CDOs, CLOs, CLSs, swaps, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.42,0)">This is why financial instruments or financial institutions’ balance sheets cannot be perfectly transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.77,0)">It would destroy the business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.83,0)">If a successful fund manager were obliged to fully disclose his investment strategy, others would immediately do the same and he would go out of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.96,0)">Financial regulation was intended primarily to prevent very opaque and risky products from being produced by financial institutions and sold to savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Over the years, however, a shadow banking system, unregulated, has developed, which aims to produce and sell the kinds of product not normally available in the regulated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.46,0)">This trend has been tolerated by regulators because these high-risk financial products were developed and purchased by wealthy institutions and individuals who were supposed to understand the risk and deal with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.14,0)">Moreover, the institutions developing such products were not considered as being systemically important – it was not thought that their failure would jeopardise the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.86,0)">This was why hedge funds were left unregulated, even after the collapse of LTCM, an event which should have raised the alarm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.3,0)">The shadow financial system was relatively small at the end of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">But over the past decade it has grown enormously, in particular the hedge funds and investment banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The speculative activity of the traditional banking sector has also developed exponentially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Let me give you some figures: the total assets of the five major US investment banks as a percentage of US GDP increased from about 13% in Q1 1999 to 31% in Q1 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As for the global hedge fund industry, the capital under its management went up from USD 155 billion to USD 1.5 trillion between Q1 1999 and Q1 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">That’s a staggering 853% increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are basically two factors behind this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The first, as already mentioned, is the higher profitability of the non-regulated financial sector compared with the regulated one, which has pushed the former to enter aggressively into the latter’s business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The quote taken from Gillian Tett’s book is quite telling in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The higher profitability of the non-regulated sector attracted the attention of the regulated one, which tried to equip itself to enter into higher-risk business, in particular to originate and distribute high-risk products, in particular through off-balance sheet vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.65,0)">The more regulated institutions entered such high-risk business, the less profitable this business became, because of the greater competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">This in turn created the incentive in the non-regulated sector to innovate, creating more sophisticated products, which often were too sophisticated for other institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.84,0)">As I mentioned, increasing competition in finance tends to promote risk-taking and thus potential instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We know what the solution to this problem is – regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.08,0)">This brings me to the second factor behind the development of the shadow banking system: the lack of regulation or even the deregulation of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.09,0)">In the ten years leading up to the crisis, not only was the burgeoning shadow banking system left unregulated, but also the traditional banking system was deregulated and allowed to enter into businesses which should have been reserved for the shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The US offers the best-known example of deregulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The repeal, in 1999, of the Glass-Steagall Act removed the barrier between commercial and investment banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As a consequence, the latter started to operate in the traditional banking business although they were not subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In particular, the investment banks entered into the mortgage business and developed portfolios that were repackaged and resold as CDOs and other instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.46,0)">The result was that the commercial banks came under greater competitive pressure and probably felt they had to enter into riskier kinds of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.16,0)">The lack of regulation as regards several components of the financial system has been highlighted in a number of reports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.95,0)">Activities of systemic importance were, for instance, not subject to any form of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.52,0)">There was, for example, a lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives business, a lack of oversight for hedge funds, not to mention other shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.37,0)">Moreover, the narrow focus of the regulation that did exist, relating to traditional commercial banks, encouraged them to transfer parts of their business to unregulated entities off the balance sheet, and they thus exploited gaps in the accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.5,0)">Why did this happen?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This is a key question that must be answered if we want to build a better system and not just plug the leak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.39,0)">Let me start by suggesting how it happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.74,0)">Clearly, the decisions not to regulate the shadow banking system and to deregulate the financial industry were taken deliberately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">It was undeniably in the interests of the shadow banking system not to be regulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And it was also in the interests of the banking system to be deregulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The increased profitability of the financial sector – which in the middle of this decade reached 40% of corporate profits in the US, more than double the average over the previous forty years – was also used to lobby the political authorities and the regulators with the aim of reducing regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A recent publication by two non-profit organisations, Essential Information and the Consumer Education Foundation, have estimated that over the 1998-2008 period about USD 5 billion was spent by financial institutions   on campaign contributions and lobbying activities for the US Congress and Administration in order to get rid of a large part of the financial regulation enacted after the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.85,0)">The outcome is ironic: the lobbying ended up sowing the seeds of the biggest economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The report details all the draft bills that pushed deregulation forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">International competition in the financial sector has no doubt led legislators in various countries, in particular in Europe, to compete in order to secure a level playing field, which turned out to be lower and lower, in terms of regulatory constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.84,0)">A veritable race to the bottom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Lobbyists have even been granted some dignity in recent years as legislators have made it their custom to consult the industry whenever new regulatory – or should we better say deregulatory – initiatives were proposed, so as to ensure that the interested parties could express their views and influence those of the legislators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Asymmetry of information plays a role also in this relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Typically, financial market participants have greater knowledge of the financial products that are subject to regulation than political authorities and regulators, and can better assess and explain the reasons – including the advantages they would obtain – from deregulation, thus helping to implement what is in their best interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.77,0)">The holding of regulators and political authorities captive by the financial industry has been one of the main factors underlying the deregulatory process and the regulatory delays in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.29,0)">To sum up, a downward spiral has been created: the increased profitability of the financial sector over the years has encouraged lobbying for further deregulation of the industry, which then leads to still greater profitability and even more lobbying pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">It’s reasonable to ask why no contrarian force has emerged to try and stop this spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">One of the reasons is that the beneficiaries of deregulation and the developers of the shadow banking system have been quite diverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Shareholders benefited from the search for higher yield, and from banks being able to enter into more profitable, albeit more risky, business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Companies benefited from the development of sophisticated financial products which allowed risk to be securitised, thus reducing the burden of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Rating agencies benefited from the development of new sophisticated instruments to which they had to attribute a synthetic rating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They even gave advice to banks on how to develop such instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Households benefited from the development of financial instruments which allowed them to borrow cheaply in order to buy consumer goods or houses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.98,0)">It’s difficult to imagine who, if anyone, during this Goldilocks scenario was a loser, except maybe those financial institutions and operators which were more cautious about playing the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.49,0)">In other words, the losers were those who did not dance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And if so many people benefited from the system, the political authorities could only benefit, and encourage it, and their acquiescence increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To quote a recent article by Simon Johnson: “Because everyone was getting richer, and the health of the national economy depended so heavily on growth in real estate and finance, no one in Washington had any incentive to question what was going on”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.66,0)">Until something went wrong, that is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.76,0)">It was bound to go wrong, because the system of incentives led economic agents to search for higher and higher yields, even at the cost of reducing regulation or permitting unregulated activities, and thus made instability inevitable sooner or later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What I have just described might be considered as another way to characterise the reference to the “human factor” made in particular by Greenspan or to the rational behaviour mentioned by Richard Posner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It’s the chain of incentives of investors, institutions, supervisors, politicians which lead society to take upon itself a greater degree of risk of a private or public nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.4,0)">As Alan Greenspan said: “ Unless somebody can find a way to change human nature, we will have more crises and none of them will look like this because no two crises have anything in common, except human nature”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It’s a very clear warning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.23,0)">What are we doing about it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.57,0)">I don’t want to give the impression that human nature cannot be changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Hopefully this crisis will have thought some lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.11,0)">The problem is that the interconnectedness of the financial system makes it vulnerable to the behaviour of the less competent, those that do not learn the lesson.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The dangers do not come from the ‘good dancers’, to use again Chuck Prince’s analogy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">The good dancers will always find their seat when the music ends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.63,0)">The danger comes from the ‘bad dancers’, especially those who believe that they are as good as the others and embark on pirouettes, eventually stumbling and making others fall when the music stops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.05,0)">The functioning of markets is bound to be affected by those participants who have taken excessive risks, relative to their ability to manage them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.4,0)">They represent a danger for the system, as drunken drivers represent a danger for safe drivers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Hopefully this crisis has also convinced that it is difficult, if not impossible, for market participants to self-regulate in a way that would produce a less risky environment for financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Again, self regulation works when all market participants agree to it, but the worst dancers will always have the incentive not to agree, and to deviate from regulation in order to be able to deliver similar returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.77,0)">Under these conditions, regulation can only be imposed by an authority outside financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Indeed, it should be in the interests of market participants – and of taxpayers – to have a powerful regulator “ established with the authority and courage to slow down the music for everyone”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The initiatives that have been taken over the last few months, in particular by the G20, the FSB and the IMF, aim to fix the problems that gave rise to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I won’t go into all the initiatives, measures and commitments that have been made, for they are well known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They are all very important and necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We should nevertheless ask ourselves whether they are sufficient to tackle the causes of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.77,0)">We must ask ourselves whether, with their current status, the supervisory authorities will indeed have the power to slow the music down when they consider it essential to safeguard financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">We know that the pressures for deregulation will mount again, as soon as the crisis is over, financed by the huge profits that the financial sector will generate again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is not a theoretical question, nor so far distant in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It is well known that very strong forces are at play right now – as we speak – to minimise the changes to the regulatory framework proposed after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">And these forces will grow as the crisis recedes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.65,0)">Just to give an example, on 3 October 2009 the Financial Times had a front-page headline ‘ Top bankers launch fightback against feared regulatory overkill’ – an article reporting on discussions at the annual meetings of the Institute of International Finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">At a roundtable discussion at the IMF-World Bank Annual meetings in Istanbul recently, I heard a comment often made by some financial market participants: “ We don’t really need new regulation: everything is there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It should just be applied”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.78,0)">If this was true, the real question should be why the supervisory authorities have not made full use of the existing regulations, in particular the discretionary elements allowed for, such as in the second pillar of the Basel II framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.39,0)">The answer is that the supervisory authorities have been put under extreme pressure, by the financial industry, market participants and even political authorities, not to use these discretionary powers, as they would cut the profits of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.23,0)">As capital is internationally mobile, financial companies tend to penalise those countries where supervision is tougher by moving their funds and operations to those where supervision is lighter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The crisis has shown that the countries that have incurred the lowest costs from the crisis are those where the supervisory authorities have stability as a top priority and where they have implemented regulation with the discretion available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One example is the use of dynamic provisioning of capital in Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.69,0)">In contrast, in several countries where the supervisory authorities have opted for a light approach, because they were pressured by the political authorities or were required to promote their domestic financial system, the taxpayers have paid a very heavy price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.45,0)">The costs of these regulatory and supervisory failures have been borne not only by the residents of the countries concerned but also by those of the other countries as a result of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The principle of home country supervision, which assigns responsibility to the supervisory authority of the country where the bank is incorporated, is viable only if there is confidence in the foreign supervisory body – that it can be trusted to do a good job and not be held captive by its industry or its political authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.49,0)">Without such confidence the single market cannot survive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How can we address these issues?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Let me mention three areas in which, in my view, we should make progress – they are essential if we want to establish a more efficient supervisory structure and better protect the system from future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.91,0)">The first area concerns the independence of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.63,0)">As I just mentioned, at the root of the crisis is the regulatory and political ‘capture’ of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It leads them to favour short-term priorities over medium-term stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It’s nothing new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It has been examined notably in the literature on the time inconsistency of optimal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.61,0)">Decision-making systems which are closely associated to political institutions tend to be biased towards the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.23,0)">Politicians are inevitably induced to aim at achieving something that is visible to their constituents during their term of office.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.76,0)">For obvious electoral reasons, they are tempted to pursue policies that are more likely to have a short-term impact but which may be counter-productive over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.71,0)">In the same way, the electoral cycle discourages them from adopting policies of benefit to society over a time horizon which goes beyond their electoral mandate but which entails some hardship to be endured before then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Short-term pain rules out longer-term gain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A case in point is monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.74,0)">When it is implemented by policy-makers who are accountable to their constituents in the short term and who pursue two contrasting objectives – such as inflation and growth – the result might be a highly expansionary policy with excessive inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The solution has been to create, in most countries, independent central banks in charge of monetary policy and with a clearly defined objective, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.02,0)">When this happened, some people reacted negatively, saying that a key aspect of economic policy should not be left to unelected technocrats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, few today would overturn this decision, as over the years independent central banks have kept prices stable – but not at the cost of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Can supervisors be made as independent as central banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In some cases they can, at least from the operational point of view, when the task is assigned to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Supervision conducted by independent central banks has proven to be more resistant to regulatory capture and to political pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.45,0)">But making supervisory authorities fully independent is a bit more complicated than doing the same with monetary policy-makers, because the objective of supervision cannot so easily be turned into a benchmark as simple as a percentage for the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.48,0)">If financial stability became the sole objective of the supervisory authority, the result might be excessive regulation to prevent the failure of any bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But, for monetary policy, the primary objective of price stability does not rule out secondary objectives, which should be pursued without infringing the primary one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For supervisors the primary objective should be to promote the stability of the financial system, domestic and globally, but secondary objectives could also be foreseen, entailing in particular efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.53,0)">Another constraint on the independence of supervisory authorities, one which is often mentioned in policy discussions, is that their decisions may have an impact on the taxpayer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So it requires some control by government authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.77,0)">I personally believe that this argument is flawed and misplaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.35,0)">In the conduct of monetary policy, or the lender of last resort functions, independent central banks also take decisions which affect taxpayers, in a way which might be even more relevant than when supervisory authorities take their decisions, for instance when they assess the solvency of an institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Can it be denied that it's better for society if such decisions are taken by an independent body which can assess in a fair way the options available for handling an insolvent bank and present those options to the fiscal authority?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will not dwell longer on this issue, but it certainly deserves further thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The second area where progress is needed concerns international cooperation between supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There is a broad consensus on this issue and certainly much progress has been achieved over the last few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.32,0)">However, here, more than in other areas, the devil is in the detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We can see it within the European Union, where the creation of three supervisory agencies, as proposed in the de Larosière report, is currently being discussed in the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Attempts to limit the scope of cooperation and avoid interference with national competences are never far away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Some progress has been made with the creation of Colleges of Supervisors, which exist for the major banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However this can only be an intermediate step as the many Memorandums of Understanding do not necessarily guarantee a level playing field for supervisory functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The presence of European Agencies’ representatives in the colleges, as is currently proposed, would represent a first step towards ensuring some consistency in supervisory approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">The third area refers to the accountability of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.14,0)">Who supervises the supervisors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Accountability is currently established at the national level, because – it is often stated – it’s up to the national taxpayers to pick up the bill.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">In other words, it’s up to the national political authorities, who represent their taxpayers, to be in charge of assessing the activities of the supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.97,0)">However, as the current crisis has shown, some taxpayers had to pick up the bill of institutions which should have been better supervised by foreign supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.99,0)">In a global financial system, the domestic political authorities cannot by themselves really ensure the accountability of the domestic supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.85,0)">Another constraint on the current system derives from the complexity of the activities performed by the supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.27,0)">This makes the exercise of accountability quite difficult, especially for non-experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.46,0)">Unlike monetary policy, the effectiveness of which can be summarised in a few statistics, supervisory activity cannot be reduced to just the number of institutions which are supervised or have failed, or to the number of warnings which have been issued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">What is currently missing is a system of expert international monitoring and assessment of the activities performed by supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Institutions like the IMF, the OECD, or the European Commission in the EU, are in charge of monitoring and assessing the performance of central banks, fiscal authorities and governments in a general way, with respect to a wide range of policies and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">Supervision does not fall within the realm of this international cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are forums where supervisory authorities hold discussions in order to achieve convergence in supervisory practices and to exchange information on how they perform their functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">But there is no independent assessment of how these functions are performed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">After the Asian crisis of 1997-98, the G7 agreed to entrust the IMF with Financial Sector Assessment Programs in all countries to assess the resilience of the financial systems in advanced and emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.75,0)">Aside from the fact that not all countries participated in that assessment, it is only a snapshot of the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What would be needed is a periodic evaluation of the activities performed by the supervisory authorities in the major countries, in order to assess not only their independence but also the way in which they carry out their functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Such an assessment would be of great benefit to the national political authorities to whom the supervisors are accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">To sum up, the current initiatives to strengthen the regulatory framework are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">On the other hand, the institutional framework underlying the supervisory functions needs to be reinforced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Supervisory authorities need to be made more independent, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">more capable of slowing down the music.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.78,0)">They also need to cooperate more with each other, because it is no good slowing down the music in some jurisdictions if it continues to run fast in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Finally, we need a system that will monitor and assess internationally the activities performed by the supervisory authorities, one which will strengthen both cooperation and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.58,0)">The current crisis has been characterised by many as a crisis of capitalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.93,0)">I wonder whether it might also be a crisis of our democratic system, a challenge to its ability to manage complex and global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, many parts of society benefited from the loose approach to supervision and regulation of the financial activities which took place in the run-up to the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.79,0)">Market participants have been short sighted, and so have the political authorities and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Can this crisis convince them to look further ahead?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Can we expect the longer-term interests of society to prevail once again over short-term incentives which led to instability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.21,0)">The signals coming everyday from several financial market participants as well as political authorities do not seem so encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The former are waiting for the dust to settle and for things to return to ‘normal’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.39,0)">The latter can only be as far-sighted as those they represent, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">those who elect them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">What is really needed then, to quote that famous phrase, is somebody who will “ take the punch bowl away just as the party gets going” again; somebody who has the authority to slow the music down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I am fully aware that this is not easily done, but it is not impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It took the high inflation of the 1970s to convince the political authorities that monetary policy should be implemented by independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It would be better not to ‘waste’ another crisis to come to the same conclusion for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.0,0)">Interview with the BBC on 10 September 2009.</span><span
