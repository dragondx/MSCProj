    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)"> Rebalancing in the euro area: are we nearly there yet?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.62,0)">Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Danish Economic Society, Kolding, 15 January 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, dear Per, The euro area crisis was a crisis fuelled by imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.45,0)">Imbalances laid the ground for economic and financial turmoil, in part due to the euro area’s design flaws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.94,0)">And the difficult process of repairing imbalances within that design sustained the turmoil further and let its consequences become entrenched, tearing our social fabric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.15,0)">If we want lasting stability and growth in the euro area, we cannot let the same things happen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The long-term solution is to complete our monetary union and make it less vulnerable to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The foundations of this road have been laid by the Five Presidents’ Report, and it implies setting up new risk-sharing mechanisms among the participating economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.82,0)">But that will not happen in a situation where large imbalances between member countries already exist and are considered as a state of nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.9,0)">Just like John Rawls pointed out with his concept of the “veil of ignorance”, it is impossible to achieve an optimal solution for a group if the winners and losers are clear a priori.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.57,0)">Citizens are rightly suspicious that risk sharing may turn into risk shedding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">We can only strengthen the euro area, to the benefit of all, if all member countries imagine themselves in comparable positions behind a veil of ignorance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This is why resetting all our economies onto a path of sustainable rebalancing is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Sustainable rebalancing is key to reducing risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is key to creating the preconditions for all euro area countries to stabilise, grow and converge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">And it is key to laying the groundwork for Economic and Monetary Union to be completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro area has been going through such a rebalancing process for several years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So what I would like to do in my remarks is review where we stand today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">How far has rebalancing come?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Is that rebalancing sustainable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And, if not, what do we need to do to make it sustainable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These questions do not only matter for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">They matter for the rest of the world as well, since rebalancing has important implications for global growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.28,0)">If every economy were to react to their domestic challenges by exporting their slack, it would only trigger a race to the bottom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Therefore, only through achieving a truly sustainable rebalancing can the euro area start generating rather than absorbing global demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Dimensions of sustainable rebalancing So what is sustainable rebalancing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There are four aspects we need to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first is that external and internal rebalancing are twin concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">For rebalancing to become truly sustainable, progress on both fronts is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">This follows from Macroeconomics 101: the current account position is the mirror image of the balance of savings and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.15,0)">External rebalancing achieved through, for example, raising savings and depressing domestic investment, might not be compatible with robust growth or high levels of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">The second aspect is the interaction between flows and stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Rebalancing has traditionally been seen as resolving flow imbalances, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">the current account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">But it is also about sustaining sufficient flows over time to stabilise stock imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.58,0)">That is because, even with a balanced current account, excessive net external liabilities create instability and may be unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.36,0)">And as is the case today in many euro area economies, an internal debt overhang slows down the economic recovery and hence impedes internal rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">The third aspect is the role of surplus and deficit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Rebalancing could, in theory, be achieved by all euro area countries adjusting vis-à-vis the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But, in reality, as 50% of euro area trade is intra-area, it must involve rebalancing within the euro area as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.16,0)">And to be sustainable, that rebalancing cannot take place solely through demand depression in deficit countries in a way that prevents their internal balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It requires symmetrical adjustment in surplus countries too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">“Symmetrical”, of course, does not mean that all countries should have a perfectly balanced current account, but rather that both excessive deficits and excessive surpluses should be adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.04,0)">The fourth aspect is the cyclical and structural drivers of rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">If current account improvements are being driven mainly by lower imports in a weak economy, they are likely to unwind when the economy recovers and imports rise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">But if they are being driven by structural changes – such as competitiveness gains and reallocation of resources towards productive sectors – they are more likely to be sustainable in the steady state, both externally and internally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">All four aspects are integral to the rebalancing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Sustainable rebalancing requires that adjustment is stable, symmetrical and structural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Only under those conditions can all economies achieve full employment in a way that is robust to global developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So what do we see in the euro area today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Progress with rebalancing The imbalances that built up in the euro area before the crisis were sizeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Current account deficits in the five   programme countries – Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus – had doubled from, on average, around 5% of GDP in 2000 to about 10% of GDP in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.97,0)">Moreover, those imbalances were financed largely by volatile, debt-based cross-border flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.42,0)">That left several countries vulnerable to a rapid reversal in financing, with little ex-post sharing of risks between private borrowers and lenders – a so-called “sudden stop”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Since then, we have seen considerable flow improvements, especially in the countries that entered the crisis with large current account deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Deficits in the   programme countries have adjusted dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">On average they are in balance today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.18,0)">Only Greece and Cyprus are still recording small deficits, while the other countries have moderate surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In the three Baltic countries the improvement was even more dramatic, averaging 17 percentage points since 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The composition of adjustment has also been encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Aside from Ireland and, to some extent, the Baltics, import compression played a strong role in closing current account deficits in the first phase of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">But since 2012, improvements in deficit countries have been driven predominantly by robust growth in exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.07,0)">The previous dramatic fall in internal demand in stressed countries had in fact not only depressed imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">It had pushed firms to look for new international markets as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Demand for exports in deficit countries has also been supported by intra-euro area rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.52,0)">In particular, though Germany continues to run a record overall current account surplus, its trade surplus vis-à-vis the euro area has diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.04,0)">It fell from close to 4% of GDP in late 2007 to around 1% of GDP today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Imports from the euro area have also increased notably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In this sense there has been some symmetry in the adjustment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Several factors suggest that these developments are not purely cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.99,0)">On the demand side, estimates by the ECB, as well as the IMF and the European Commission, suggest that – with the exception of Greece – the majority of current account adjustment in deficit countries has been “non-cyclical”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.03,0)">“Non-cyclical”, however, does not mean “structural”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.91,0)">What it means is simply that, though falling demand did depress imports during the crisis, potential growth has fallen as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.07,0)">Thus, when the output gap closes, current account positions should not substantially worsen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">On the supply side, there is also evidence of structural shifts in deficit countries that should help sustain their export performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Cost competitiveness – measured in terms of real effective exchange rates deflated by unit labour costs   – has improved strongly since the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.64,0)">In most cases real effective exchange rates now stand close to 1999 levels or even below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">That suggests much of the pre-crisis “excesses” have been reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">To give some examples, in Ireland the improvement in cost competitiveness from peak to trough is close to 50 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In Greece and Latvia the figure is around 30 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Spain and Cyprus have seen improvements of 20-25 percentage points, while for Portugal the figure is around 15 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In each case, the largest part of the improvement has come from relative cost adjustments rather than changes in the nominal exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.1,0)">What is less well known is that we have also seen cost adjustments in surplus countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In Germany, ULC growth relative to the euro area has accelerated strongly in recent years, on the back of more robust wage growth and slowing productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">That has translated into a small correction in its cost position relative to its euro area partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">However, thanks to the depreciation of the euro exchange rate, Germany’s competitive position relative to the rest of the world has also improved during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Stable rebalancing Still, all this does not mean that the rebalancing process has reached its steady state, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.61,0)">First, the fact that rebalancing has been achieved, to some extent, by falling potential growth is hardly satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.07,0)">We cannot have a situation where rebalancing only holds if potential growth remains low and unemployment high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.89,0)">Remember that, despite the notable improvements since 2013, in several stressed countries employment is still more than 10% below 2008 levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.27,0)">Any external rebalancing that does not generate jobs is not one that will last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Achieving both external rebalancing and high employment requires a better reallocation of available resources, which means shifting resources to the tradable sector and, more generally, to the most productive firms operating within each sector of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This would boost total factor productivity and, therefore, potential output on a long-lasting basis, and also make the necessary adjustment in relative costs more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Many countries still have a way to go in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.89,0)">Admittedly, in many crisis countries ULCs have fallen and relative prices between the tradable and non-tradable sectors have adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.72,0)">Yet sectoral labour flows show that, in the early phase of the crisis, there was no reallocation of jobs to the tradable sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.0,0)">Rather, employment declined across all sectors in a context of collapsing domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">More recently, although some countries have added jobs in the tradable sector, by far the largest sectoral contributor to employment gains has been the services sector, which in many countries is largely non-tradable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">What is more, preliminary evidence shows that there is still a lot of progress to be made in the reallocation of resources within sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">This plays an even more important role for total factor productivity growth in mature economies such as those in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">All this points to a need for further internal adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">But it also highlights the continuing importance of product market reforms, such as completing the single market, which open up services markets to competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This would encourage intra-sector reallocation among the most productive firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">And by making services more tradable, it would mean that employment growth in that sector would also contribute to rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Second, despite the flow improvements, external imbalances in stock terms remain high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The net international investment position   of most countries with large net foreign liabilities has stabilised, thanks to current account improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.09,0)">But it has not yet fallen towards safer levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.71,0)">All five   programme countries still have a negative NIIP in excess of 90% of GDP, and in some cases much greater.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The NIIP of major surplus countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, has also continued to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">That suggests further adjustment is still needed to achieve a sustainable external position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">European Commission projections suggest that the NIIPs of Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal will remain at levels associated with substantial external vulnerabilities over the next decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">To meet the threshold specified in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure – which is an NIIP/GDP ratio of -35% over a 10-year period – each would have to make substantial improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">It is also important to note that internal debt levels – the debt a country owes to itself – remain high as well in several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For example, in Spain more than 60% of public debt and 80% of private sector debt is held by Spanish residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.44,0)">This may not contribute to net external liabilities, but it contributes to the general debt overhang, which holds back credit and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Internal debt, therefore, also needs to be tackled to achieve a sustainable internal rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.95,0)">Structural rebalancing In short, former deficit countries still face twin challenges to achieve sustainability: they need to further lower their net external liabilities, while continuing to rebalance their economies internally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">The difficulty is how to do this without the one objective cancelling out the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In terms of addressing the external position, there are two, admittedly stylised, ways in which countries can do this: they can pay down debt or they can grow out of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.2,0)">Yet given the size of the net liabilities involved, each option taken in isolation has challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.14,0)">Paying down external debt would require very large surpluses coupled with sizeable nominal adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.16,0)">As rebalancing towards the tradable sector has not yet been completed, it is difficult to see how this could happen without depressing incomes and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.16,0)">Further still, the scale of the required adjustment would create prolonged disinflationary expectations, which would raise expectations of future real interest rates, depress demand and hinder internal rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, growing out of debt through boosting nominal GDP – a so-called “beautiful deleveraging" – is also not feasible on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Reducing NIIPs solely through the denominator would require unrealistically high rates of growth, beyond even the most heroic assumptions for structural reforms and/or fiscal and monetary stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.56,0)">What is more, a large growth spurt without structural change might simply suck in imports and lead to new external imbalances emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Incidentally, a third option would be to aim to change the composition of net external liabilities – that is, to replace debt with equity and foreign direct investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This would not alter the level of NIIPs, but it would reduce vulnerabilities by improving risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In this context, the Capital Markets Union project could be powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">However, this has to be considered a longer-term goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The only way ahead over the medium term, then, is for crisis-hit countries to find a combination of current account surpluses and nominal GDP growth that can produce both external and internal balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">So how can that be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Further action on the nominal side is clearly necessary, in particular to support employment and resource reallocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And, within limits, that would not necessarily be inimical to growth: a recent modelling exercise by the IMF shows that wage moderation may have a positive economic effect on crisis-hit countries, especially if accompanied by more dynamic wage growth in surplus countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The structural reforms undertaken since the crisis would also allow such adjustments to be made more quickly and with less employment cost than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.1,0)">However, at some point nominal adjustment leads to a change in dynamics – that is, the positive substitution effects of relative price changes are dominated by the negative effects on incomes and real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">That is why any effective adjustment strategy also has to be based around productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Productivity growth both lowers ULCs, supporting exports, and lifts permanent income and potential output, supporting debt reduction through real GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">And though this might lead to higher investment, that would not necessarily be contrary to current account adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">If new investment occurs in the tradable sector it should lead to a stronger exporting base in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Another factor in favour of focusing on productivity is that the types of reforms that will deliver productivity growth are likely to have less negative effects when monetary policy is at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">That is because they act more on fixed costs than marginal costs, and hence have less impact on prices and real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">For example, measures such as judicial reform or opening up closed professions are likely to primarily boost investment – and hence productivity – with little disinflationary effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.36,0)">For all these reasons, and as I have said on several occasions  , seeing rebalancing as all about cutting costs – which is what policymakers often think of as “competitiveness” – is misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Productivity growth is central to competitiveness and to growing out of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">This is confirmed by the IMF exercise I just mentioned: the benefits of wage moderation diminish as more countries engage in it, whereas if all countries engage in structural reforms to raise productivity the benefits are large and uniform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Among the structural reforms that reduce fixed costs, one that is likely to have the strongest impact in the current environment is improving insolvency regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">This would help tackle the debt overhang for viable firms by reducing the costs of debt workout.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">And it would also allow non-viable firms to fail faster, supporting reallocation to more productive ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This is the message of a recent analysis from the European Commission, which finds that a good insolvency framework is associated with speedier adjustment of non-performing loan ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Symmetrical rebalancing That said, it is also clear that sustainable rebalancing cannot only involve measures in crisis-hit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Rebalancing has to be somewhat symmetrical, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">surplus countries also have a contribution to make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Such a contribution is partially about strengthening domestic demand, though we know that spillovers to crisis-hit countries through higher imports are likely to be small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But what is more important, in my view, is the role of surplus countries in supporting euro area price stability – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">an inflation rate of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This would allow the remaining relative price changes within the euro area to take place against a higher nominal bar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And that would in turn avoid deflationary nominal adjustments that raise real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">So how could this be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As I already mentioned, wages have been rising more robustly in surplus countries, which is welcome and consistent with rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Yet some argue that more is still needed in terms of demand-side policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Such measures would no doubt support euro area price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.97,0)">But they would have very limited impact on potential output and the permanent income of households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">One can therefore question how much they would, in isolation, contribute to a sustainable rebalancing over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The situation may be different, however, if growth is boosted by a combination of higher public investment and structural reforms creating incentives for higher private investment, which will induce a rise in permanent income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This could be a major confidence boost to the economy resulting in a surge in investment expenditure and a corresponding endogenous increase in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">But at a later stage, when the real effects of structural reforms show through, supply would catch up and inflation pressures would abate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">For surplus countries this would, in my view, be a win-win outcome, thus setting the right domestic incentives to adjust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">In some surplus countries the output gap is currently closing in the presence of low potential growth and a significant savings-investment imbalance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">With the policy measures I have mentioned, they would instead be able to move towards a new, win-win equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">An equilibrium that would not only be consistent with the external balance, but also tackle the interrelated domestic challenges of weak private and public investment and low potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">At the same time, this adjustment would be “self-limiting”, in the sense that upward pressure on inflation would be temporary and would not fundamentally undermine the country’s external competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">How rebalancing plays out between surplus and deficit countries will determine the role of the euro area in global growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">As crisis-hit countries need to run continued surpluses to reduce their net liabilities, the euro area as whole will continue, unless the surpluses of other countries fall, to run a large surplus with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.89,0)">With weakening demand in emerging markets, this essentially puts the burden of generating global growth squarely on the shoulders of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That may be asking a lot, especially if the secular stagnation hypothesis is to be believed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.35,0)">Indeed, as I pointed out in a recent speech in Berkeley, export-led strategies risk a fallacy of composition: they may be relevant for one economy, but in the aggregate they risk leading the global economy into a high saving, low real interest rate trap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It is vital that all major economic areas contribute to global growth to avoid a descent into beggar-thy-neighbour policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.74,0)">The alternative risk is that, if adjustment in the euro area is too asymmetric, it may ultimately stall in crisis-hit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Pre-crisis imbalances would then not be fully reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">That might contribute to a reduction in the euro area current account surplus, but at the cost of creating new risks down the line.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.02,0)">That is neither in the interest of the euro area nor the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Euro area countries have made substantial progress with rebalancing in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">But many still have a way to go to make rebalancing sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Doing so is not only essential for their own stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">It is also key to creating the conditions for completing monetary union in a way that will prevent imbalances from emerging again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The full potential of using the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure to strengthen euro area surveillance has so far not been realised, neither for preventing nor for correcting imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">From now on, it is important that its corrective arm is used forcefully and without exception as soon as excessive imbalances which endanger the smooth functioning of EMU are identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The roadmap to a complete monetary union is there: it was laid out in the recent Five Presidents’ Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But the political will to enact it will not exist unless economic divergences are first ironed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is clear that monetary union cannot now be built from behind the veil of ignorance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">But all countries can take measures to make their economic policies converge and reduce foreseeable risks, which is what makes mutual insurance possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.85,0)">Ultimately, it is economic divergence that fuels political divergence, and this is what makes the euro area so fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Sustainable rebalancing is the first step towards avoiding such divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">, Esteves, P.S., Rua, A. and Staehr, K.  , “Exports and domestic demand pressure: a dynamic panel data model for the euro area
