    <span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)"> Restarting a Market: The Case of the Interbank Market Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,ECB Conference on Global Financial Linkages, Transmission of Shocks and Asset PricesFrankfurt, 1 December 2008 Introduction   It is a great pleasure for me to speak tonight in front of such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.48,0)">Tonight, I would like to share with you some concerns about the present state of financial markets, as some of these markets are not functioning properly or are barely functioning at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Given the relevance of this issue at a global level, I find it quite interconnected with the topics addressed at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Markets exist for many goods - but not for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.93,0)">There are many conceivable markets for goods and services that do not exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.46,0)">Milton Friedman, for example, was famously puzzled by the absence of inflation-linked securities, although we have seen some developments since his times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I am sure each of us would be able to come up with other examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.48,0)">Reasons for the incompleteness of markets may be related to the obstacles to setting up an environment for trade, such as transaction costs, network externalities in trading, costs related to legal enforcement, or more generally asymmetric information problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It can happen that society would benefit from the creation of a new market, but that market forces may not be sufficient by themselves to overcome such obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In these cases, the public sector can play a role in the starting of a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These considerations are particularly pertinent for financial markets, which require significant technical infrastructure, where network externalities are very important, and where asymmetric information plays a paramount role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In fact, it is no surprise that stock market capitalisation and financial market development are an increasing function of institutional and legal development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.18,0)">I would like tonight to focus on a special activity in the field of market creation, which is the re-starting of a market which has stopped functioning properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I consider as an example the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.77,0)">As you are aware, the functioning of the interbank market has been severely affected by the recent events in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.12,0)">While precise data on market activity are not available, as much of the money market activity   takes place over the counter, contacts with market participants indicate that the turnover, especially in longer-term segments of the money market, has decreased drastically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Central banks have increasingly become intermediaries for interbank transactions, as witnessed by the steep increase in the size of their balance sheet  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Especially since the introduction of fixed rate tenders with full allotment in the Eurosystem weekly open market operations, coupled with a narrower corridor for standing facilities, banks have been borrowing very large amounts in the Eurosystem open market operations and at the same time have significantly increased their recourse to the regular deposit facility offered by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Trading with central banks has thus to a large extent replaced interbank trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">Unusual as it may seem now, a financial system without a proper interbank market is not unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In fact, even in some euro area countries, full-fledged money markets came into existence only in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.38,0)">Also in Japan, starting in the middle of the 1990s, a weakening of the financial sector and a series of bank failures led to a breakdown of the interbank market, in some respects not unlike the situation we are facing today in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In such a context, there are two questions that arise for a central bank and that I would like to address tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.54,0)">First, how is monetary policy affected when the interbank market does not exist?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.22,0)">Second, how can the interbank market be restarted?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.49,0)">The current money market environment is characterised by a high degree of mistrust among participants, based on general uncertainty and asymmetric information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I will argue that the public sector plays an important role in re-establishing confidence in the functioning of the interbank market, be it by re-shaping the market environment or by taking a temporary intermediation role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At the same time, the aim is not to permanently replace the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The public sector needs to ensure that an exit strategy is in place that allows it to withdraw from its interfering role and to leave room for market forces to unfold in a constructive way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.25,0)">Running monetary policy without an interbank market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.83,0)">Let me start with the first question: why is the interbank market important?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">A deep and liquid interbank market supports the main purpose of financial intermediation, the channelling of funds from savers to investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the traditional view, banks take in deposits from a large number of consumers and channel these funds to profitable investment projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.12,0)">A reallocation of funds between banks may be necessary because of the rise of unexpected   liquidity needs of banks, or simply because banks are heterogeneous and specialise in different activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.9,0)">Without an interbank market, such reallocation would be difficult and most likely not lead to an efficient outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.64,0)">For a central bank, a key question is how current tensions in the interbank money market influence the financing conditions faced by non-financial corporations and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.47,0)">Addressing this question is central to understanding how the transmission of monetary policy to the economy as a whole has been affected by the financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, in normal times, the money market plays a central role in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.01,0)">Given the bank-centred structure of the euro area financial system, the marginal cost of funding bank loans   is a key determinant of bank lending rates and thus of financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">By steering very short-term money market interest rates to keep them close to its official rates, using its regular monetary policy operations, the ECB has been able to influence the longer-maturity rates that are relevant for bank loan rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.59,0)">However, in the context of the drastic reduction of turnover in the unsecured markets, especially for longer maturities, large and variable spreads have emerged between the policy rates determined by the ECB and unsecured money market rates   which are the basis for bank loan rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.8,0)">When no transactions are taking place, the meaningfulness of unsecured money market reference rates   is open to question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Yet, even if the EURIBOR is not meaningful as an indicator of money market transactions, it is still of importance from the perspective of transmission of information along the yield curve, because the interest rates applied to many outstanding loans are indexed to, or at least priced against, the EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">Moreover, many derivative contracts relate to benchmark interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The dislocation in the usual relationship between short-term rates is illustrated by     More formal empirical pass-through results suggest that despite the tensions in the unsecured money market and the resulting widening of the EURIBOR-EONIA spread up until October 2008, euro area banks so far seem to be continuing to adjust their short-term retail rates to changes in the term money market rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.76,0)">Thus the persistence of money market tensions is hampering the smooth transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.6,0)">Furthermore, it is not just the pricing of loans but also the availability of bank credit that is affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.96,0)">While many euro area banks tend to depend less on wholesale funding than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, typically having large retail deposit bases, even their ability to grant new loans depends, at least to some extent, on the possibility of using the interbank market as a marginal source of funding, especially in case of an unforeseen shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.38,0)">Consequently, a complete drying-up of the interbank market has important implications for the supply of loans beyond the interest rates charged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.81,0)">This is all the more important as even well-managed banks become more and more dependent on obtaining funds in the overnight market, as term borrowings mature and can no longer be replaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Notwithstanding the importance of a functioning interbank market, central banks do have to find a way to influence the provision of credit also in its absence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.02,0)">In France until the mid-1980s, for example, no developed interbank market, as we know it today, existed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this environment, the Banque de France determined the level of interest rates using bilateral relationships with a few major banks in the country, which were the only counterparties to its open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Given the two-tiered structure of the French banking system, it was indeed able to steer the general level of interest rates, even though this took place in a less developed system without markets for sophisticated financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.5,0)">In Japan, in the first half of this decade, the situation was somewhat different, as money markets were shallow not only because of the high credit risk in unsecured transactions, but also because of the extremely low level of nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Unable to lower interest rates further, the Bank of Japan tried to encourage the provision of credit by its policy of quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.32,0)">With interest rates very close to zero, interbank trading dried up almost completely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The case of Japan illustrates well the importance of a well-functioning interbank market also for other financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.23,0)">Without a price for short-term liquidity, the market for term lending stopped functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.39,0)">Furthermore, the basis for other financial markets, such as repo, bond and certain derivatives markets, disappeared, and these markets became less liquid as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">In the present environment, the intermediation role taken by the central bank replaces to some extent money market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are limits, however, to the extent that a central bank can perform this function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, not all participants in the money market are banks and thus eligible to interact with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This holds even for the Eurosystem, which has, compared with other central banks, a very large counterparty base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.76,0)">Second, the central bank cannot provide liquidity at all maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It can in fact only offer a standardised range of products, while the market could display much more variation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Third, the central bank treats all counterparties equally: banks obtain liquidity at uniform rates, and they can post the same collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.14,0)">In an interbank market, on the contrary, banks can vary loan rates, depending on the credit risk of the borrower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Thus, there is a role for the collection of information   here, which serves to find the appropriate valuation of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Creating and restarting an interbank market Given the benefits of an interbank market, its revival is of high importance to central banks right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The revival of a market that once existed is quite different from setting up a completely new market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In many countries, including many of the Eastern European economies, central banks supported the creation of completely new money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Such support is helpful if the existence of such a market is beneficial to its potential users, but especially when there are obstacles to setting it up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For instance, trading on markets may be much more beneficial once a certain critical mass of trading volume is reached; this is the concept of network externality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Also, conventions may need to be agreed upon before trading picks up in a particular market segment – in the context of the interbank market I am thinking of conventions like the establishment of certain reference rates that contracts can be based upon, such as the EURIBOR rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Finally, only sufficient technological progress may make a market viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.53,0)">For instance, short-term repo markets were in the past difficult to establish because settlement was costly and time-consuming – this was much facilitated with the advent of fully computer-based real-time settlement with straight-through processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">No individual market player can have the financial resources and the incentives to pay the fixed costs needed to set up a market, although an association of private players conceivably could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.88,0)">The reactivation of a market is a different story and requires a different set of measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The previously mentioned measures helped to overcome problems related to the infrastructure of markets, or the absence of conventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">These initiatives could help if there was a need by private agents to have such a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Reviving a market, on the other hand, alludes to a situation in which the necessary infrastructure is in place, and in which market participants have full knowledge about products and procedures, but simply choose not to participate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The challenging task here is to encourage banks to participate again in a market, that is, to create a need to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">More than in the setting-up of a new market, in the reactivation of the market the key hurdle to overcome is asymmetric information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.58,0)">A main factor behind the drying-up of a market is the lack of trust that loaned funds will be repaid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">This is based on two concerns:   the first is the general uncertainty about the state of the financial sector, and in particular, the future path of asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.32,0)">The second is the currently very high degree of asymmetric information about counterparty risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.26,0)">As is well understood since the work of Akerlof  , asymmetric information can lead to reduced market activity, in which only the “worst” parties are willing to trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.41,0)">In the extreme, this can lead to a complete breakdown of the market: bankers, who have to decide on extending loans in an environment of extreme uncertainty, are reluctant to lend in a market in which no-one else lends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Banks with comparatively healthier balance sheets should theoretically have every incentive to lend in the market in order to signal their condition and possibly attract external financing on better terms; in equilibrium, all banks should therefore be lending to each other in order not to signal their poor quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.63,0)">However, in the current environment of low confidence and trust this virtuous mechanism has difficulties to develop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The fact that transactions in the money market are over-the-counter, and therefore not widely known, could also contribute to preventing this positive signalling mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.51,0)">How can such market malfunctioning be avoided?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In theory, there are two types of remedies to this: the first is to foster a general decrease of asymmetric information about the quality of goods that are traded in a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For the interbank market, this would imply that better information on a bank’s credit exposure is available to potential lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">In other words, the banking sector needs to be put on more solid grounds again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Here, one factor is to improve banks’ solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The second factor is to ensure that liquidity problems do not turn into solvency issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Thus, a second measure to foster interbank market activity is to ensure its liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.1,0)">Finally, a further reason for market activity not to pick up is related to network problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.96,0)">If one side of the market is basically non-existent – I am referring to the lending side of the term market – then this may reduce the incentive for participants to be the first one to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.87,0)">A liquidity manager of a bank may not dare to do trades that are considered exceptional compared with others, because he may be punished more severely for any losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.57,0)">Herd behaviour exists not only in booms, but also in busts, or even when markets do not exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">This has to do with benchmark remuneration practices which are very common in the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.11,0)">The result of such practices can be multiple equilibria, some of which are characterised by a high trading activity, some by a lower one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.52,0)">Thus, a further action to remedy the situation could entail the steering of markets from one equilibrium to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">From theory to practice: reviving the interbank market I will now examine in more concrete terms the measures that I identified above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The first way to limit adverse selection in the interbank market is to increase transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.28,0)">Currently, more than a year after the start of the financial turmoil, the distribution of risks among financial market players is still not entirely known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This asymmetric information is a fundamental reason for the heightened solvency concerns that led to the cutting of credit limits and the elevation of rates in the unsecured interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In principle, more information about the allocation of these risks should help in re-assuring banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">As I mentioned earlier, sound banks should have an incentive to disclose detailed information in order to signal their quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In doing so, they have to make sure that this clearly distinguishes them from more troubled banks so that a pooling equilibrium is avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is well conceivable that sound private banks form “clubs” in which they mutually trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The second measure is a reduction of credit risk in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In the past months, in particular after the failure of Lehman Brothers, which led to an intensification of tensions in money markets,   European governments have discussed and put forward packages that aim at alleviating risks associated with bank assets, improving banks’ solvency and generally enhancing confidence in the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These include capital injections, public buying of distressed assets and issuance of government bonds that are deposited with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Furthermore, interbank lending guarantees   have been provided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">These plans aim specifically at addressing the problems that hinder banks from lending to each other – that is, they can help the recapitalisation of banks that are solvent and fundamentally sound, but do not have sufficient capital, so that concerns about counterparty credit risk are alleviated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Any improvement can, of course, only be gradual, but some positive effects are already being seen in the money markets, for instance the drop of three-month EURIBOR rates that followed a wave of government rescue plan announcements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me now address the third type of measure, which relates to the need to ensure that liquidity problems do not turn into solvency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">One factor potentially triggering such a development is the classical bank run by depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In fear of massive runs on the banking sector, many governments, in September 2008, issued or enhanced widespread guarantees for depositors in case of a bank failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But naturally, liquidity conditions are under the direct control of the central bank, so let me turn to the measures employed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Since the start of the credit turmoil in August 2007, the ECB has reacted quickly and forcefully to alleviate tensions in money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Any measures that the ECB has taken, or might be taking in the months to come, are mainly addressed at this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">As the monopoly supplier of central bank money, the ECB has sufficient means, valid scope and abundant flexibility to intervene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is not, however, in a position to address banks’ credit problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The ECB’s actions during the past one and a half years were able to stabilise the overall liquidity situation in the market, and thus avoided that individual banks’ liquidity problems could be a factor aggravating the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the first wave of measures  ,   the ECB used its general and flexible framework of monetary policy implementation to change the timing and the maturity of liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.99,0)">Namely, the ECB adopted front-loading practices, where a large amount of liquidity was offered at the beginning of each reserve maintenance period and progressively reduced towards its end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">It also increased the average maturity of its open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Finally, it made use of swap lines with the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">These liquidity measures aimed to reassure banks that they would not be “squeezed” for liquidity at the end of the maintenance period, by allowing them to fulfil their reserve requirements early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">When from September 2008 market tensions dramatically intensified, a new set of temporary liquidity measures was announced by the Eurosystem on 8 October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First and foremost, all regular open market operations are now conducted as fixed rate tenders with full allotment, so that banks’ aggregate demand determines the liquidity provision to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Second, the width of the corridor between the two standing facilities was narrowed symmetrically to half its former size, in order to keep short-term rates under tighter control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Finally, the list of assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations was expanded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">The aim of this second wave of measures was to assure banks that the ECB was willing to provide sufficient liquidity under all circumstances, and to eliminate fears that liquidity problems could turn into a series of bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.01,0)">The ECB however faced a conflict between trying to achieve, on the one hand, ample liquidity conditions and smaller fluctuations of short-term interest rates, and on the other hand, to maintain an active interbank market for short maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Indeed, these second-wave measures were characterised by a major increase in the intermediation role of the ECB with respect to interbank money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.32,0)">Notably, the average activity in the overnight segment of the money market   declined by around 40%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.1,0)">Possibly, however, the activity in interbank markets would also have declined further in the absence of the ECB’s measures, as they were introduced at a time when interbank markets had all but disappeared already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The benefits of recent ECB actions can be regarded from two perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">First, several of the new measures can help to re-activate the market in a direct way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The expansion of the collateral framework allows banks to post a larger variety of assets as collateral for Eurosystem operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">This should, first, increase banks’ availability of assets that can be used in the repo market, such as government securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Moreover, it would increase the value of all eligible collateral that banks have at their disposal and promote its use in interbank transactions, given that at any time it can be used to obtain liquidity from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Second, the narrowing of the corridor between standing facility rates, as well as the introduction of fixed rate tenders, constitute an effective protection against liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">More specifically, these measures should reassure the markets that liquidity is available at a low opportunity cost, when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This should provide important help to banks at the current juncture, because it effectively guarantees access to liquidity for all banks in need, thereby eliminating liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In that sense, if a bank knows that it will always be able to get unlimited short-term funding from the central bank against adequate collateral, it might become less restrictive in extending term credit in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Further steps and open issues Both the governmental initiatives to address credit concerns in the banking sector, as well as central banks’ liquidity provision, have helped to stabilise the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Three unanswered questions remain: Will these measures be sufficient to let the financial markets return to normality?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.57,0)">What are the downsides of the proposed measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">What else can be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Whether the measures put forward by governments will be successful will depend crucially on their design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.9,0)">So far, their announcement has halted the widening of money market spreads, but they have not resulted in a significant reduction either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Some positive signs can be extracted from anecdotal evidence of at least some renewed activity in the term money market, and also in the Short Term European Paper   market, where issuance by financial institutions has slowly, but steadily, increased over the past three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">In interpreting this evidence, one should keep in mind that the market is currently preparing for the year-end, which regularly causes market tensions, and there is hope that some recovery could take place early next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.13,0)">These measures are often criticised on three grounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.59,0)">First, they can be slow to implement, and, inevitably, this also affects the speed of recovery in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Second, in some cases, taxpayers’ money is used to refinance an industry which has, in the past years, reaped substantial profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.32,0)">Third, these measures are prone to create moral hazard: that is, while they alleviate present tensions, they may be taken for granted in the future, lead to further imprudent behaviour in the banking sector, and thus sow the seeds for possible new crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">While this might be true, I believe that at the present stage, the financial crisis has reached a level where our first priority has to lie with the resolution of present problems, and there has been no alternative to acting firmly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">At the same time, to limit moral hazard implications, a clear exit strategy needs to be put in place for the extraordinary interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">I would also like to stress that a careful design of these measures is crucial, to avoid negative side-effects as far as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.29,0)">I would like to single out some problematic aspects of government guarantees on interbank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Such guarantees can indeed help in reviving the interbank market, as they eliminate credit concerns in unsecured lending transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, they would entail a wide re-nationalisation of money markets and thus reverse a long process of liberalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">Here, it is essential that the guarantees do not interfere with the Eurosystem’s ability to steer conditions in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.61,0)">Moreover, depending on the national implementation of such measures, a substantial distortion of the various national segments of the euro area money market could result, thus impairing a common monetary policy across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.77,0)">For example, in its recent Opinion on the draft Austrian law on the stability of the Austrian financial market, the ECB has made it clear that “ uncoordinated decisions among Member States should be avoided as they may involve a fragmentation of the euro area money market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.84,0)">Another question is whether the ECB’s measures to ensure central bank liquidity should be further amended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">On the one hand, the high degree of central bank intermediation that we are currently seeing may be needed to keep banks afloat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">On the other hand, the market may be ready to take a more active role, in which it relies less on central bank financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.15,0)">Indeed, a situation, in which banks simply find transactions with an intermediating ECB safer, cheaper and more convenient than trading with their peers, would be an unwelcome scenario from the point of view of the ECB, among other reasons because it would make an exit more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.07,0)">It should be stressed that our intermediation role is clearly a temporary measure which should be reversed as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In this regard, at some point the ECB may start thinking about measures that would help to reactivate the money market, such as a re-widening of the corridor in some way or other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.72,0)">Such a widening would reduce the intermediation role of the Eurosystem and would be a necessary measure to reactivate some segments of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, it is not a necessary condition, so one cannot be sure to which extent the money market would be revived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.98,0)">This would depend on other obstacles to trading – such as low credit limits – that cannot be addressed via liquidity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">To find the appropriate timing of further changes to the way it supplies liquidity, the ECB needs to carefully weigh the benefits of reassuring banks with regard to their liquidity concerns against the potential costs of a further, potentially massive intermediation role for the central banks, which could make the revival of the interbank market more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Three additional considerations have to be kept in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">First, in the recent period some improvements have been noted in the financial markets, or at least it seems that the situation has not deteriorated further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.83,0)">EURIBOR-OIS spreads have come down and some activity has re-emerged in term markets, albeit very limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Second, the combined effect of our measures and the government measures may take a while to be felt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Third, interbank spreads in the US and the UK are even higher than in the euro area, in spite of the lower level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There might thus be an international dimension to the problem that can hardly be tackled with national measures only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The above considerations suggest that work still needs to be done to induce banks to be active again in markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.14,0)">However, it should be recalled that ultimately, the main factor behind the malfunctioning of the interbank market is counterparty risk, and this risk can disappear only if the commitment to avoid bank failure is credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">As I recalled in a recent speech, euro area countries have committed themselves solemnly, at the 12 October Paris meeting, to ensuring adequate capitalisation of the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.97,0)">The implementation of this commitment is lagging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">Furthermore, the meaning of “adequate” is subject to interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Supervisory authorities continue to use their regulatory measures, and rightly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">However, markets consider that this is not sufficient and would like to see banks being further capitalised, in light of the uncertainties about the economy and about their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Public authorities in all countries have made public money available for such recapitalisations and the ECB has defined a common pricing scheme, which would ensure a level playing-field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.1,0)">However, there is the problem of the “first mover”, and banks are afraid to apply for such recapitalisation because of the stigma that would be attached to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.77,0)">There is thus a coordination failure that needs to be addressed by public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Ideally, all banks should be provided with extra capital, in a way that is not penalising but sufficient to reassure markets that indeed no bank will be allowed to fail, even if the economy deteriorates further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This type of recapitalisation, in excess of prudential requirements, would be a way to restore confidence in the financial system and tackle the macroeconomic problems that would emerge if banks start curtailing loans to the private sector as the preferred way to achieve the capital requirements that markets request.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is important that the European authorities in charge of competition and state aid realise that such capital injections are nor aimed at addressing individual banks’ solvency but rather to promote macroeconomic and financial stability and should thus be assessed on criteria that are not only legalistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.1,0)">Any time that is spent to delay these recapitalisations results in delaying the stabilisation and recovery of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Conclusions I would like to conclude by re-iterating that a fast revival of the interbank market is of high importance for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Different public authorities have already taken a number of steps to increase confidence in banks and the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These types of measures may be enhanced and refined further, and will hopefully reduce credit risk, which is one of the major sources of reduced interbank market trading activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The Eurosystem has, since the start of the turmoil, adjusted its liquidity provision to banks and ensured that banks have continued access to liquidity, to avoid situations where illiquidity might raise solvency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">These actions have helped to stabilise the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, in an environment with remaining major concerns about credit risk in the banking sector, the ECB has increased its role as intermediary in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">When considering possible further measures to revive the money market, the ECB must carefully balance the objective of steering short-term money markets and ensuring sufficient liquidity in the banking sector, on the one hand, and its wish to foster a reactivation of the money market, on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Finally, I would like to emphasise that both central banks and governments have done a lot to support the banking system to help it cope with the recent challenges and to restore confidence in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">These measures, which constitute a safety net for the financial system, should act as a catalyst to recreate an environment in which financial institutions act again as financial institutions, and start again lending to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.36,0)">Last observation: Sep. 2008.</span><span style="background-color:
