    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)"> Ways towards more dynamic growth Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the DZ BANK Kapitalmarktkonferenz 2015, Frankfurt, 14 July 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, Today we are considering “Ways towards more dynamic growth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As you have invited me in my capacity as a member of the Executive Board of the ECB, I’d like to start off with the role of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The effectiveness of our monetary policy also depends, however, on decisions in other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I will thus cover reforms both at Member State level and European level a little later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.87,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB is meeting this week to discuss euro area monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The result will be a joint decision which I cannot, nor may not, pre-empt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We have agreed that it is our duty to remain silent in respect of monetary policy in the week before the monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.16,0)">If I say something today about previous monetary policy decisions or point to theoretical relationships, it should not be interpreted as a sign of how we shall decide the day after tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy is appropriate and effective In view of sluggish lending, growing uncertainty about the recovery and the ongoing cloudy outlook for inflation we agreed on a series of monetary policy measures last summer: We lowered the key interest rates; We shaped the longer-term refinancing operations so that they offer banks an incentive to grant more loans to the real economy; and We started a new programme for the purchase of covered bonds and asset-backed securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.9,0)">First of all, our loose monetary policy last year led to a bottoming-out of the still negative lending by banks in the euro area amid ongoing gloomy growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.69,0)">However, the inflation rate continued to fall and on an ever broader basis, which means that the decline was not only attributable to the fall in the price of oil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.28,0)">What’s more, the inflation outlook worsened because of flagging demand and continued uncertainty about economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">That was reflected particularly in the market’s inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.27,0)">The expectations threatened to become uncoupled from our medium-term objective – an inflation rate of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In these circumstances we had to react decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.37,0)">A central bank must act boldly before expectations of a further fall in the inflation rate become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We have done exactly that: in January the Governing Council of the ECB decided to expand our existing purchase programme of covered bonds and ABS by including a wide-ranging purchase programme for public sector securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The decision was not only necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It was also expedient: we were able to bring to an end the fall in medium and long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Expectations have in fact now risen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our experts are forecasting an inflation rate of on average 0.3% this year, 1.5% next year and 1.8% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Lending is steadily recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And not only because interest rates are low, but also because companies’ order books are better and the mood in the economy is improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We are thus seeing a cognitive turnaround as well, a positive upwards spiral, to which our monetary policy is contributing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Incidentally that’s the case here in Germany as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And that applies despite the unintended – and undenied – side effects of our monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">These are all positive signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But we haven’t reached our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.06,0)">According to Eurostat’s flash estimate the inflation rate in the euro area in June fell to 0.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Our forecast that the inflation rate over the medium term will rise to just under 2% is based on the assumption that we shall complete our purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We intend to continue our purchases until September 2016 and to maintain the programme in any case as long as inflation has adjusted in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">For we have only fulfilled our mandate when we can clearly show that the inflation rate has levelled off in a sustainable way near to our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.34,0)">Structural reforms are vital Yet we cannot conceive of monetary policy as being isolated from other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.29,0)">In short, the more the structural conditions in the Member States vary, the more difficult it is to take care of price stability in the whole of the euro area with a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That’s why we don’t tire of talking about structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.21,0)">This term occurs in around one-third of all the published speeches of the Executive Board members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.22,0)">By way of comparison, it occurs in only around 2% of speeches given by the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">With our monetary policy we can support economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">But it will only have its full effect if the governments of the euro area countries carry out sensible reforms to improve their competitiveness and thus create conditions for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Only when the structural framework conditions permit profitable economic activity will businesses make full use of improved funding conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">It would therefore be naïve to believe that economic measures alone – including monetary policy – could lead to a lasting return to stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Structural reforms are also necessary in order to counter any possible future shocks more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">More flexible labour and product markets increase the resilience of countries in which the adjustments are also made via prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">That means, for instance, that more flexible wages lessen the adjustments needed in the labour market in an economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The risks of long-term unemployment are reduced in this way and an economy recovery takes place more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Above all, in a monetary union like that of the euro area – in which monetary policy cannot react to country-specific developments – such adjustments are key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The structural reforms that make sense for individual Member States to implement depend on the respective national factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.49,0)">It is up to the elected governments to decide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As a central bank we only have an interest in each country successfully carrying out the respective necessary structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And that is certainly possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">For instance, Spain carried out a comprehensive reform package in 2012 and 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.22,0)">And it did so in a situation in which a quarter of the population was unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Spain is now one of the countries in the euro area with the strongest growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">However, I see a need for reforms in all countries of the euro area – even those which are currently comparatively well positioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.15,0)">Now is not the time to rest on the successes of previous reforms, let alone to go back on ambitious reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.85,0)">An economy which is short of skilled labour, in which whole regions are shrinking and ageing, which does not overhaul its bridges and roads is living on its reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">When a society uses up its wealth, it cannot credibly claim to want to grow dynamically or even sustainably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.81,0)">A society in which the number of over 80-year-olds is set to rise by almost 50% in the next 15 years runs the risk of losing its will to reform and thus its capacity to integrate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Then there’s a tendency to protect vested rights and to acquire the conservatism of a closed society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">It’s precisely for that reason that governments in Europe should not only call for structural reforms elsewhere but also, and above all, in their own countries in order to create a favourable economic climate – then the whole of the union will benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.78,0)">Our economies have been linked much too tightly for a long time for us to be able to conceive of the economic and fiscal policies of the individual countries as being completely independent of each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The euro area is not a loose association of independent states but a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Reform of the monetary union is necessary Europe’s heads of state and government made a conscious decision to establish such a monetary union instead of just simply adopting a system of fixed exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Now EMU must live up to this name.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Spurred on by the effects of the crisis, some progress has already been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The euro area should now be subject to stricter budgetary rules and the economic policies of individual Member States better coordinated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We have stricter supervisory rules for the financial sector at both European and global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.95,0)">Naturally this also affects the financing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.47,0)">For example, the new liquidity requirements mean that some banks will have to rethink their traditional business models, which can also have an effect on companies’ financing situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">With the Single Supervisory Mechanism   and the Single Resolution Mechanism  , we have finally taken a clear step towards integration on the way to a European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">However, in the medium to long term, if we really want to live in a stable and prosperous union we must continue in an ambitious way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is why the “five presidents”   produced a report which presents concrete, short-term measures – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">ones that can be implemented without treaty change – as well as longer-term ideas about how the monetary union should work in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would like to pick out two points from this report today which I find particularly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, the five presidents argue the case for completing the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">A completed banking union will sustainably improve financing conditions for companies and increase the resilience of the European financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This requires reaching a quick agreement on bridge financing for the resolution fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">One option would be a line of credit from the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It would have to be designed in a budget-neutral way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This means that advance payments from public authorities would be repaid through appropriate levies on the financial sector over the course of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This would help loosen the close connection between sovereigns and their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">If it succeeds, it will noticeably relieve the pressure on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Second, the five presidents are in favour of sharing more sovereignty in economic and fiscal policy over the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The absolute prerequisite for this, however, is that the convergence mechanisms of the monetary union work better in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.74,0)">Those who deviate from this must be stopped earlier and more firmly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">If this succeeds in stabilising the euro area in such a way that it becomes more resilient, then common standards and decisions in fiscal policy matters are not just conceivable, but also necessary to a certain extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is not about the complete centralisation of all aspects of Member States’ revenue and expenditure policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But a genuine monetary union only functions smoothly if certain decisions are made jointly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A euro area-wide treasury could – at some point – provide the framework for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">These are ambitious suggestions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">They cannot be realised overnight because they must be borne by our democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But they show the direction in which the monetary union should develop in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">And we can and should already be taking the first steps in this direction now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is now up to the European heads of state and government to consider the proposals, further substantiate the longer-term ideas and implement them in the interests of a deepened Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Final thoughts The euro area economy is recovering slowly but steadily, thanks in part to our most recent monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">These measures were necessary, appropriate and they are effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I am confident that the economic recovery will continue to make progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">Especially in a monetary union, neither individual policy areas nor the different political and decision-making levels should allow themselves to think in isolation from each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The well-being of each individual Member State depends not just on the situation in each country, but also on the rest of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The crisis has demonstrated this all too clearly, and policy-makers have reacted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The institutional structure of the monetary union is significantly stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">In the meantime, however, the enthusiasm for reform has clearly weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The five presidents’ report should be reason enough to bring back more dynamism into the discussion about the further integration of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.11,0)">We will not be able to complete Europe’s integration project today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.36,0)">Recent experience has made this clear: the convergence process is undermined if the claims to sovereignty of Member States gloss over their individual responsibility and even if compliance with agreed rules, which are in their own long-term interest, is refused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Only if all members of the monetary union agree on a common way forward can we take the next steps in the right direction today – steps to more dynamic growth, greater prosperity and more stability.</span><span
