    <span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)"> A future-oriented approach to pan-European innovative retail payment solutions Welcome address by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB conference “An innovative single market for the euro”, Frankfurt am Main, 6 May 2019 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to welcome you here today to this conference on an innovative single market for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">It is a great pleasure to see so many of you here today, and I can see that we have quite a lot of new faces as well as many of the ECB’s regular counterparts in the payments and securities world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I’m not surprised at the level of interest in this conference, since we are going to be discussing topics that deal with nothing less than the future of the European payments and securities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">We will discuss new technologies, new competitors and new payment solutions – and the need for stakeholders to adapt to the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Over the next two days, we will be discussing the interesting and important issue of how to create a viable, future-proof payment market for us and for our single currency – the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Having been born in 1999, the euro itself belongs to Generation Z, a group often characterised as digital natives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Unlike the rest of us, they didn’t have to learn how to use technologies such as the internet and smartphones because they have never known anything different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Members of Generation Z often refer to themselves as innovative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Success in business now and in the future requires an understanding of the important role innovation plays for Generation Z and those that come after them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">How does this translate into the world of payments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What are the expectations for innovative payments in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">What can we as a central bank do to facilitate payments innovation at a pan-European level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These are some of the questions that will be tackled at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Our aim is to discuss and foster a joint understanding of the challenges ahead and the solutions to work towards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">This is why we have brought together both our more established counterparts and new market actors from fintechs and start-up companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Running in parallel to the conference – and fitting to the theme of innovation – we have organised the ECB instant payments challenge and a hackathon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The ECB instant payments challenge offers a vibrant marketplace for providers to present prototypes of their innovative end-user solutions for instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">At the hackathon, developers and experts have been invited to team up and create open source mobile solutions for SEPA instant credit transfers within the next 24 hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The solutions emerging from both the instant payments challenge and the hackathon lab will be showcased at the conference and will no doubt provide further inspiration for our discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And I am pretty sure that our discussion will be a lively one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Before we get started, I would like to make some brief general remarks on the European payments market, the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure as the basis for payments integration and innovation, and our vision for the development of pan-European instant payments solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The basis for innovation: a sound market infrastructure A domestic European payments market – which is both integrated and innovative – is fundamental to the creation of a more integrated, competitive and innovative Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">And in a world of increasing digitalisation and globalisation, such an integrated and competitive payments market can only be achieved by exploiting the potential offered by ever more sophisticated innovative technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Both established and new market actors should be able to benefit from the innovative space created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The Eurosystem has contributed substantially to an integrated European financial market by providing the market infrastructure which enables the safe and efficient flow of payments and financial instruments across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But the work is by no means complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.65,0)">The European financial market faces digitalisation challenges from both the regulatory and the technical side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me give a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The revised Payment Services Directive   was put in place to foster innovation and enhance competition in the retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Payment service providers have to accommodate enhanced security requirements and provide account access to third-party payment service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">On the technical side, the introduction of instant payments means that internal systems and procedures need to be overhauled so that retail payments can move from batch processing into the real-time universe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The Eurosystem, too, has been looking for ways to make use of technical progress to improve the efficiency and lower the costs of its market infrastructure services – the TARGET services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.32,0)">Just think of the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement service, or TIPS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">TIPS is a new Eurosystem market infrastructure service that was launched in November 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is a truly domestic European market infrastructure settling in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">TIPS enables banks to provide customers with instant payment solutions that can potentially reach recipients all across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Another Eurosystem market infrastructure initiative is the upcoming introduction of central liquidity management within the new TARGET services, which will make the use of central bank money even more efficient for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">By enhancing a stable infrastructure and enabling pan-European harmonisation in the settlement of payments and securities, we supply a core component for the provision of innovative products and services at the domestic euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And we also support the aims of the capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Impetus for the development of standardised pan-European instant payment solutions With PSD2, the SEPA instant credit transfer scheme and TIPS, the retail payments market in Europe has the building blocks it needs to provide innovative pan-European payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, adopting the instant credit transfer scheme and connecting to TIPS as a passive participant or reachable party so that customers may receive instant payments is just a preliminary step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It is also not enough just to provide the core SEPA instant credit transfer as a faster alternative to the SEPA credit transfer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Providers also need to tap into the potential of growing payment volumes, both at physical points of sale/points of interaction in shops and in e-commerce and they need to offer domestic pan-European solutions that are safe, efficient and easy to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">What we are seeing is that global providers are successfully tapping into this potential, using the pan-European SEPA schemes – or cards – as the basis for end-user solutions that appeal to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">There is nothing wrong with that – as long as our regulatory requirements are respected and there is competition and diversity in the payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">But will there be sufficient competition and diversity in the European payments market in the long run if we continue as we are doing now?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.29,0)">What is the biggest challenge for payment service providers in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Is it the harmonisation and integration measures introduced by central banks and regulators, or is it global competition?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Might it not be more future-oriented to aim to deliver strong and resilient domestic European payment services in general and truly pan-European instant payment solutions in particular, rather than defending national legacies or creating new regional or group-specific solutions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Conclusion The Eurosystem wholeheartedly supports the creation of an innovative single payments market for the euro through its market infrastructure projects and policy work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">We invite actors in the payment service industry to work with us on a future-oriented approach to pan-European innovative retail payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This will enable us to safeguard a competitive and diversified payments market –for the benefit not only of Generation Z, but of all individuals and businesses making euro payments across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I wish you a fruitful discussion and an enjoyable conference.</span>
