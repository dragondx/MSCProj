    <h2> Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels, 18 December 2001 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament with the President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 113  of the Treaty on European Union Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels, 18 December 2001 With the transcript of the questions and answers Ladies and gentlemen, in continuation of our regular dialogue, it is my pleasure to report to your Committee today on our assessment of the economic and monetary environment and the monetary policy decisions taken by the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Moreover, as this testimony is the last before the introduction of euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002, I will give you a brief overview of the final state of preparations for this important event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finally, the ECB has taken decisions relating to the issue of euro banknotes and the allocation of monetary income within the Eurosystem, which I shall also briefly address in my opening remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.79,0)">Economic and monetary developments Since my last testimony on 12 September, the economic outlook for the world economy and the euro area has changed significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">As I reported to you at that time, immediately after the terrorist attacks on the United States, the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem started to take measures to ensure the normal functioning of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The Eurosystem conducted several open market operations which helped to stabilise money markets in the euro area and, benefiting from a swap agreement between the ECB and the Federal Reserve System of the United States, also contributed to alleviating shortages of liquidity in US dollars among euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The monetary policy response of the ECB after the terrorist attacks was equally prompt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">As the attacks increased uncertainty substantially, the events of 11 September had the potential to reinforce the downward trend in economic activity which was already working its way through the global economy, including the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.41,0)">With the prospects for economic growth weakening, it was also likely that inflationary pressures in the euro area would moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.8,0)">On the basis of these considerations, the Governing Council reduced the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points on 17 September, in concert with an equivalent decision by the Federal Reserve System of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.44,0)">In the subsequent weeks, it became increasingly clear that the economic slowdown in the euro area would last longer and be more pronounced than previously expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.76,0)">At the same time, we could then see that the shocks to the price level stemming from the increases in oil prices and the depreciation of the euro in 1999 and 2000, as well as from the food price increases seen in early 2001, would eventually have only temporary or one-off effects on consumer prices and were gradually falling out of the calculation of annual inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.54,0)">The expectation of a downturn in inflation rates in the context of a weakening of domestic demand in the euro area also increased the likelihood of wage moderation continuing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">It was therefore likely that inflationary pressures in the euro area would remain contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This assessment was in line with the analysis stemming from monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The strong growth in M3 in this year largely reflected shifts in private investors' portfolios away from shares and other longer-term financial assets to more liquid, relatively safe short-term assets included in M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These shifts should only have a temporary effect on M3 growth and should not be seen as an indication of future inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.67,0)">This assessment was also supported by the fact that credit growth to the private sector has been falling steadily since end 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.49,0)">In light of these considerations, the Governing Council took the decision on 8 November to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">At its meeting on 8 November 2001, the Governing Council also decided that it would henceforth – as a rule – assess the stance of the ECB's monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.02,0)">Accordingly, interest rate decisions will normally be taken during that meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At the second meeting of the month, the Governing Council will focus on discussing issues related to the other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me now elaborate a little further on the current economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">As regards the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 amounted to 6.8% in the period from August to October 2001 and was thereby significantly above the reference value of 4ï¿½% for annual M3 growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Governing Council reviewed and confirmed this value of 4ï¿½% at its meeting on 6 December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.94,0)">This decision was taken on the grounds that the available evidence continues to support the medium-term assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value, namely a trend potential output growth of 2-2ï¿½% per annum and a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ï¿½-1% per annum in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When comparing current monetary developments with the reference value for the rate of growth of M3, it should be borne in mind that the reference value is a medium-term concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.42,0)">Temporary deviations of M3 growth from the reference value do not necessarily have implications for future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.57,0)">The Governing Council has therefore always made it clear that monetary policy should not react mechanically to deviations of M3 growth from the reference value, but would rather have to carefully analyse the causes and implications of such deviations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.25,0)">In fact, temporary deviations from the reference value relating to pure portfolio shifts are not unusual and might even be expected in the context of extraordinary economic developments, as has been the case in the most recent period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">At the same time, we will need to continue analysing developments in M3 in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.0,0)">Should the current economic and financial market uncertainties subside, any persisting excess liquidity in the economy should be carefully reassessed with respect to whether it signals risks for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Turning to the analysis under the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the evidence that has become available after the Governing Council meeting of 8 November 2001 has confirmed the expectations of the Governing Council regarding lower inflationary pressures in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.74,0)">A first estimate by Eurostat shows that real GDP growth was close to zero in the third quarter of 2001, and recent indicators show that economic activity has remained very subdued in the fourth quarter of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.44,0)">Looking further ahead, real GDP growth is likely to remain weak in early 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">However, conditions are in place for economic growth to improve in the course of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">First and foremost, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and there are no major imbalances that would require a lengthy process of adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The uncertainty currently overshadowing the world economy should diminish over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In addition, financing conditions are very favourable in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The recent fall in oil prices and the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will have a positive effect on real disposable income and should thus support domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In the same vein, developments in financial markets over the past few weeks signal a more optimistic assessment both of the prospects for economic growth in the euro area and of the international environment by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The expectation of stronger growth in the euro area economy in the course of 2002 is reflected in all available forecasts of international institutions and also in the most recent projections produced by Eurosystem staff and published last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.57,0)">With regard to price developments, the euro area is now clearly approaching a return to inflation rates of below 2% following the temporary peak of 3.4% in May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This reflects, as I have mentioned already, the unwinding of the previous increases in energy prices and the fact that there were no further shocks to food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.06,0)">Looking ahead, all information, including all available forecasts and the Eurosystem staff projections, supports the view that annual HICP inflation should remain at levels safely below 2% in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">All in all, we concluded at the meeting of the Governing Council on 6 December that the current level of ECB interest rates continues to be appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The information which had become available after the Governing Council meeting on 8 November had confirmed our expectations and thereby also the forward-looking monetary policy decisions we had taken over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Recent information continues to confirm this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.97,0)">Let me recall that, with these reductions, key ECB interest rates have been brought down by 125 basis points since 30 August 2001 and by a total of 150 basis points in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.73,0)">In both nominal and real terms, short-term interest rates have thus reached levels which are very low in a historical context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.38,0)">The same applies to long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The best contribution monetary policy can make to preserving favourable financing conditions is to safeguard its credibility in maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.61,0)">Monetary policy does not only have an effect on inflation expectations  , but also on risk premia, and thus also on real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.27,0)">From the point of view of the functioning of the economy, risk premia impose additional costs on the private sector in raising finance, thus hampering economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In order to contribute efficiently to the long-term growth prospects of the euro area, the best monetary policy can do is to preserve a stance clearly focusing on the maintenance of price stability, thereby also safeguarding the low degree of policy-induced uncertainty that has been achieved so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As regards recent developments in fiscal policy, similar considerations apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The maintenance of a medium-term perspective in the fiscal policies of euro area countries is crucial to supporting the overall credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact and, thereby, to strengthening the confidence of consumers and investors, particularly in the current context of weaker economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have very high public debt-to-GDP ratios, the current slowdown should not change the scope for meeting the medium-term commitments made in the context of national stability programmes within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">On the other hand, countries with a fiscal position close to balance or in surplus could benefit from the full operation of the automatic stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.56,0)">However, there is no case for fiscal activism, as this has often proved to be ineffective in the past and carries the risk of creating imbalances in public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">A key remaining challenge for the euro area is to strengthen the productive forces in the economy by providing the proper incentives for economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Indeed, we believe that the potential upward impact of structural reforms and technological innovation on trend output growth could be large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, while some progress has been made in the field of structural reform, significant further steps – especially in the labour and goods markets – need to be taken in order to achieve a permanent and significant increase in potential output growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Furthermore, in the fiscal area, governments should pursue determined structural expenditure reforms in order to create room for further tax cuts, and for absorbing the fiscal costs associated with the ageing of populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Such reforms would enhance the effectiveness of the fiscal environment in supporting employment, investment and economic dynamism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Preparations for the introduction of euro banknotes and coins In less than two weeks' time, the process of monetary integration in Europe will be completed by the introduction of euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Overall preparations for this important event are now in their very final stages, with a total of 15 billion euro banknotes having been produced by end-November, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">far more than the just under 10 billion euro banknotes which are expected to be put into circulation during the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This higher production figure also reflects the fact that several national central banks have, in the course of autumn, reassessed the number of banknotes to be produced, in order to accommodate the higher than expected orders for frontloaded euro cash, especially as regards low-denomination banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Indeed, low-denomination banknotes, in particular the EUR 5 and EUR 10 banknotes, will be put into circulation on a large scale in the first few days of January 2002, so as to further contribute to a smooth cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Frontloading of euro banknotes has started in all participating Member States and is progressing on schedule, with about 59% of all ordered banknotes having been delivered to the respective credit institutions by the end of last month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The mass media campaign conducted by the Eurosystem started in September and will continue to run until early next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In addition to TV and newspaper advertisements, more than 200 million information leaflets in the 11 official Community languages have been distributed to the general public in order to provide all the information needed for them to familiarise themselves with the new banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB has set up a special Cash Changeover Committee, comprising representatives of the ECB, the national central banks and the Commission, to monitor the proceedings of the cash changeover closely and to facilitate swift reactions by the Eurosystem, if warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To ensure efficient communication with the media and the general public, the ECB will publish daily press releases during the first two weeks of January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The ECB is also participating in the euro changeover information network set up by the European Commission in order to share all relevant information with the members of the network.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In economic terms, the cash changeover should not have significant direct effects on price levels in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">This is largely due to the strong competition in the retail sector and the vigilance of consumers, but also reflects the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices in the context of the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The issue of euro banknotes and the allocation of monetary income As of 1 January 2002, euro banknotes will be legal tender in all euro area countries and may migrate freely throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It was thus necessary to take a decision on how to allocate the issue of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In accordance with Article 16 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank  , the Governing Council decided that the ECB and the 12 national central banks comprising the Eurosystem shall issue euro banknotes, whereby the ECB will assume a share of 8% of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This corresponds approximately to one-thirteenth of the total amount, a percentage that was considered appropriate, as there are thirteen central banks within the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The remaining volume of banknote issue will be assigned to the national central banks in accordance with their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, the Governing Council has established the regime to be applied to the allocation of the so-called monetary income among the national central banks of the Eurosystem as from 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.61,0)">Monetary income is the income generated by the performance of the monetary policy function and is also referred to as "seigniorage income".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Article 32 of the Statute of the ESCB provides for the monetary income to be pooled and allocated to the national central banks of the Eurosystem in accordance with their paid-up shares in the ECB's capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As from 2002, this provision will also apply to the seigniorage income from banknotes, which was hitherto not pooled and allocated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">To mitigate the impact on current relative income positions of the national central banks, the Governing Council has decided to set up a transitional regime which provides for a progressive adjustment to the monetary income distributed among the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The adjustment will apply in full during 2002 in order to take account of the cash changeover and the dual circulation period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.18,0)">It will be phased out progressively until the end of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Thereafter, as from 2008, all monetary income will be distributed fully in proportion to the national central banks' paid-up shares in the ECB's capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Let me conclude my statement by reconfirming my strong conviction that the preparations for the introduction of euro banknotes and coins have been, or are currently being, concluded successfully and that we all can look forward with confidence to our new money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I now stand ready to answer any questions you may have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Transcript of the questions and answers Chairman, Mr Herzog   We have the pleasure of welcoming Mr Duisenberg, the President of the Central Bank, for this final monetary dialogue of 2001, and without further delay as we are running a little late, I will hand him the floor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mr President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg Thank you very much Mr Chairman, and I would like to extend my best wishes to the person you are replacing today, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who for health reasons couldn't be here I understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">My best wishes accompany her.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank continues as published above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Chairman, Mr Herzog   Thank you very much Mr President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So we begin the monetary dialogue with questions on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.92,0)">You each have one minute, and we must be very strict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">We start with Mr von Wogau.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Mr von Wogau   President, I'd like to raise this question of inflation development and something has happened that you have announced in advance and that is inflation rates are coming back to the ECB reference value: 2.1% in the eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.92,0)">At the same time there is another development that causes concern and that is the development of deficits in the four countries that you mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Now, in one of these countries, the deficit is 2.7% and that means this is moving very quickly to the borderline of 3% and my question is, how do you define the stability and growth pact in the present situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.24,0)">My second question, are we in a phase of recession or are we moving towards a recession?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.93,0)">Do you share the view of those - this isn't my view - who say that the Stability and Growth Pact has to be changed to take into account the present situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.06,0)">Mr Duisenberg Indeed the deficits in four countries are moving towards dangerous levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.31,0)">Whether we are in a recession, I think not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">We see virtually no growth in the third quarter and it is likely that there will be of very little growth in the 4th quarter of the year, but as I said, in the course of next year we expect growth to pick up again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.09,0)">So whatever the definition of a recession is, and I don't have one: I don't follow the American habit of defining a recession as two quarters of consecutive negative growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.28,0)">I believe we are seeing the trough of the slowdown at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.02,0)">The slowdown results in higher unemployment benefit having to be paid and less tax revenue coming in than anticipated for a period of normal growth, that deficits are coming under pressure, and for some countries it is coming close to the well-known 3% level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">Yet I would not recommend, as I have stated and different from your perspective, that the Stability and Growth Pact ought to be changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is the first time that the Stability and Growth Pact is tested, but I think that it is of the utmost importance to reinforce confidence amongst consumers and investors that the players do not change the rules of the game whilst the game is underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I think it will be confidence-inspiring if it is made clear to the public, to consumers and investors that governments stick to their medium term strategies as they have declared, and as they are declaring to my knowledge that they will continue to do, and I applaud that very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.84,0)">Mr von Wogau   I have a supplementary question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">First of all I must thank you for your clear explanations, and I believe that we have to make it clear that the Stability and Growth Pact is still valid and the European Union will apply the sanctions if this 3% limit is overstepped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">But my supplementary question is along the following lines: you said at the beginning of next year you expect there to be an upward trend in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Is this related to your optimism about the situation in the US?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Do you think the US economic situation will improve and that will have a positive impact on the European economy, or do you assume that growth forces, growth strength in the European Union will resume?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">Mr Duisenberg It is the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We are so to speak, on our own, in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.79,0)">In Europe, contrary to the situation in the US, a current account deficit is absent, which is a problem, which Europe does not have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It is the absence of such major imbalance and the falling trend in inflation, which will support domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">These factors and the very favourable financial conditions, which are prevailing, make me and the ECB think that the resumption of economic growth will be predominantly domestic-led.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.15,0)">Now, the assumptions about the US recovery, when and by how much, are indeed, I admit, a downside risk for these developments and these expectations, but my prognosis, if you may call it that, is not based on the assumption that the recovery would be US led.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Indeed, in that respect we are on our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Mr Goebbels   Thank you President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I am one of those who believe that that the policy pursued by the ECB has generally been very positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">You have always succeeded in having less inflation than the US and I think the preparation of the euro has been a success as well, and when you see the enthusiasm of our fellow citizens for the coins then it is a pity that we could not secure the frontloading of a few low denominations banknotes as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Nonetheless I think that your communication policy for the markets could be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.02,0)">You were our guest on the 12th of September last and no one knew that given the tragic events in the States there would be an uncertain economic climate and you mentioned this in your speech today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But at the time, on 12 September, you refused to give any indications about the monetary policy you intended to pursue and you said that we shouldn't panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I quote you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">You said that we shouldn't panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.39,0)">Then a week later on 17 September the Federal Reserve Board reduced its rates and you followed and other banks followed in what one could call concerted action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, markets were not warned in advance and your decision occurred when markets were underway, whereas Mr Greenspan was careful to warn the markets and to take the decision before the opening of Wall Street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Don't you think you could have a better information policy, a better PR, with the markets?</span>
