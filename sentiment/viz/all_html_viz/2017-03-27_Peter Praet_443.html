    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> The economic situation in the euro area and the implications for monetary policy Keynote speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the IE Business School Leadership Forum, Madrid, 27 March 2017 Today I will discuss the macroeconomic situation and monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As a central bank with a clear price stability mandate, we need to ultimately judge economic developments in the light of their implications for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Despite the recent increase in headline inflation, largely on account of rising energy and food prices, underlying inflation pressures remain subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Furthermore, convincing signs of a self-sustained convergence in inflation towards levels that are consistent with the Governing Council’s objective of below, but close to, 2% have yet to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To ensure price stability over the medium term, we must look through changes in headline inflation to the extent that they are transient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In the near future, we will have to assess how the forces that are driving prices today can influence the outlook for price stability in the medium term and help durably stabilise inflation around our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The economic recovery will support domestic price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Indeed, the upswing is continuing at a steadily firming pace and is broadening across sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The recovery has proven to be resilient against past external shocks and influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In fact, real GDP growth in the euro area has expanded for 15 consecutive quarters, growing by 0.4% during the final quarter of 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.49,0)">Economic sentiment is at its highest level in nearly six years and unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking beyond the euro area, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global recovery and increasing global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So overall, as economic conditions are improving, also the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, although they remain tilted to the downside, mainly because of global factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures have been instrumental in these positive developments in the euro area economy, as well as in supporting the resilience of the recovery in the face of external influences and prevailing uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The comprehensive set of measures introduced since June 2014 has worked its way through the financial system, leading to a significant easing of financing conditions for consumers and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Together with improving financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, this has strengthened credit dynamics and supported domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.93,0)">Since June of that year, bank lending rates for both euro area households and non-financial corporations have fallen by around 110 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.58,0)">Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises  , have declined by around 180 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, as recent surveys have shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">These positive developments have been supported by the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, as a result of which banks are passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Moreover, these improvements are not limited to interest rates: bank lending volumes have also been gradually recovering since early 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking forward, we are confident that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm and broaden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Incoming data, as well as improving consumer and business sentiment indicators, suggest that the cyclical recovery is gaining momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Private consumption growth continues to be a key driver of the ongoing recovery, which is underpinned by improvements in labour market conditions, with unemployment steadily falling despite a rise in participation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These developments increase households’ real disposable income, which in turn boosts their spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Business investment is also expected to continue recovering amid support from better corporate profitability and the very favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">As for price developments, after hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last year and reached 2% in February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This upward movement of inflation mainly reflects increases in energy and food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.78,0)">Underlying inflation – which relates more to domestic price pressures – continues to remain very subdued and has yet to show clear signs of trend inversion as unutilised resources still weigh on wage and price growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.11,0)">For example, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy has mostly remained below 1% since late 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Concerning the outlook for price developments, our latest staff macroeconomic projections suggest that the strong upward pressures on headline inflation from recent increases in energy and food price inflation are not expected to fundamentally change the medium-term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.62,0)">In fact, while the staff projections indicate that the recent price pressures will cause a hump in the inflation path in 2017 and 2018 relative to the trajectory expected in December last year, the projection for headline inflation for 2019 has remained largely unaltered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">By ensuring accommodative financing conditions, monetary policy will continue to support domestic demand by mobilising idle resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.86,0)">This will lead to a build-up of domestic price pressures and ultimately pull underlying inflation up as remaining slack in the economy is gradually reabsorbed and the output gap narrows further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In turn, this will facilitate a durable return of inflation back to a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.29,0)">Today, an important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued is muted wage dynamics, which are shaped by many factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.07,0)">At this stage, besides weak productivity developments, there is still a significant degree of labour market slack that keeps a lid on wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.48,0)">Furthermore, the process of setting wages is to some extent backward-looking in a number of euro area countries, reflecting formal and informal indexation mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Additionally, the timing of wage negotiations plays a role in postponing the point in time when growing confidence that inflation is approaching the ECB’s intended medium-term level starts to become more visible in aggregate wage figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.02,0)">Moreover, weak wage growth could also reflect previous downward wage rigidities: difficulties in reducing wages during earlier stages of the crisis may result, symmetrically, in a slower upward adjustment of wages as labour market conditions improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Overall, while we are certainly seeing a firming, broadening and more resilient economic recovery, we still need to create a sufficiently broad and solid information basis to build confidence that the projected path of inflation is robust, durable and self-sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Underlying inflation pressures still give scant indications of a convincing upward trend as domestic cost pressures, notably wage growth, remain subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Importantly, the economic recovery and the outlook for price stability are still predicated on the very favourable financing conditions that to a large extent depend on continued monetary policy support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.18,0)">Absent that quantum of support, the progress towards a sustained adjustment that we see in our projections is likely to be slower or even stall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.09,0)">Therefore, we need to look through the recent surge in inflation, which is driven by transient factors that will probably fade before long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Our conclusion that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term remains valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Of course, monetary policy cannot be the only source of support for growth: action from other policy areas is needed to ensure a sustainable economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Structural reforms can play a key role in turning the cyclical recovery into a structural recovery and the current low interest rate environment makes it politically and economically easier to implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Such reforms, if carried out now, will help to promote favourable economic conditions down the road.</span><span style="background-color:
