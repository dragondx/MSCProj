    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Achieving maximum long-term growth Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the Jackson Hole Economic SymposiumPanel: Setting priorities for long-term growthJackson Hole, U.S.A., 27 August 2011 The title of our panel today is Setting Priorities for Long-Term Growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.39,0)">Given all of our recent struggles to regain our reference growth paths, it may strike some as something of a luxury to think about the long run; central bankers and policy makers have had to devote unprecedented attention to higher-frequency economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Many new lessons have been learned; many policy and institutional innovations have been introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.57,0)">The recent financial crisis has produced a large and persistent downturn in our economies; a downturn, moreover, that threatens our long-run growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is therefore entirely natural that policy makers do not lose sight of the prerequisites for stable sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.03,0)">This is especially so for most of the advanced economies, including the euro area, characterized   by declining potential growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the face of any economic predicament, one should ask oneself two questions – what got us here, and what can get us out?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In the wider case of sustainable growth for the euro area, what matters is a commitment to structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In the case of the financial matters, a robust macro prudential and supervisory framework is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will address both these issues in my coming remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.87,0)">Likewise, some may consider it unusual to solicit views on matters of long-run growth from the President of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.14,0)">After all, pick up just about any growth-theory textbook and you'll find few references to inflation and fewer still to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Monetary policy is fundamentally viewed as neutral over the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">And indeed, inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Growth, in turn, is ultimately a real one reflecting, in particular, technology, education and training, capital accumulation, institutional quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Nonetheless, monetary-policy institutions can play and have played a fundamental role in supporting long-run, sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In many ways, I see a parallel between the theory and practise of monetary-policy making and the shaping of modern growth analysis which emphasises the role of sound/proper institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">That achieving high and sustainable growth matters, however, is easy to motivate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.07,0)">On the subject of growth differences across countries, Lucas   memorably wrote: The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Acemoglu, D., P.
