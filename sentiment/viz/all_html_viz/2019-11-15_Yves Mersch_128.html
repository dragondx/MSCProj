    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.76,0)"> Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism – recent initiatives and the role of the ECB Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Colloque de l’AEDBF-Europe, Paris, 15 November 2019 Introduction A number of high-profile cases of the alleged systematic use of banks for money laundering have been reported over the last two years, along with reports of investigations and other follow-up measures being taken by national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This has put anti-money laundering   and combating the financing of terrorism   high on the agenda of policymakers at both the European and global levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.79,0)">The European Commission, EU legislators and other authorities all rightly agree that misuse of the financial system cannot be tolerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">They have started to strengthen the EU’s AML/CFT framework, and further changes are in the pipeline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So let us take a closer look at three things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, what are the objectives of combating money laundering and terrorist financing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">Second, what is it that the ECB can – and cannot – do in this area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And third, how might the European AML/CFT framework develop in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Objectives of combating money laundering and terrorist financing The EU’s current AML/CFT framework largely follows the international standards established by the Financial Action Task Force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The framework has two main objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The first is to protect society from crime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And the second is to protect the stability and integrity of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.41,0)">EU legislators recognise that money laundering, terrorist financing and organised crime are significant problems that are damaging the integrity, stability and reputation of the financial sector and threatening the Internal Market and the internal security of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.59,0)">They also acknowledge that acts of terrorism are one of the most serious violations of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, and of the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the Union is founded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing concern two areas of EU law: the establishment and functioning of the Internal Market and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These two areas differ in the level of harmonisation which can be pursued under the current Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Even though the AML/CFT framework has been harmonised to a significant extent at the EU level, it remains strongly connected to the national legal frameworks, particularly to the criminal law of individual Member States and the crimes defined therein, which differ considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.62,0)">More precisely, both the AML Directive and the Directive on combating money laundering by criminal law contain minimum lists of the predicate offences to money laundering; that is, the types of underlying criminal activity which generate the property that need to be laundered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These lists highlight the link to the national laws of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.32,0)">First, they rely on national criminal law by referring to offences that can be punished with deprivation of liberty for a maximum of more than one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.08,0)">And second, they do not define the actual content of the individual predicate offences; this again is regulated by national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Effectively combating money laundering and terrorist financing requires a coordinated approach from legislators, AML/CFT supervisors, law enforcement authorities, judicial authorities, financial intelligence agencies, banks and other financial institutions, and many others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.31,0)">Information sharing between all these bodies has often been insufficient, particularly across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">That being said, we must always be mindful of the rule of law and protect people’s fundamental rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.66,0)">Public allegations of a bank being involved in money laundering or terrorist financing could lead to serious financial difficulties, or even cause the bank to fail, even if the allegations are later found to be exaggerated or completely unjustified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.51,0)">What the ECB can   do to fight money laundering Now what is the role of the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is important to clarify that our mandate is purely prudential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In 2013, supervisory tasks were conferred on the ECB on the basis of Article 127  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.84,0)">This Article limits the tasks that can be conferred on the ECB to those that concern policies that relate to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and other financial institutions – with the exception of insurance undertakings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">This provision, in turn, was duly reflected in the SSM Regulation which further limited the scope to banks only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There, the legislator explicitly confirmed, in recital 28, that the task of AML/CFT supervision remained with the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">That said, there is still a role for prudential supervisors to contribute to combating money laundering and terrorist financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This is reflected in recital 29 of the SSM Regulation, which states that “the ECB should cooperate, as appropriate, fully with the national authorities which are competent to ensure a high level of consumer protection and the fight against money laundering.” Indeed, prudential supervisors might come across information that could help to uncover money laundering or terrorist financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For instance, they may obtain insights into the quality of a banks’ general internal governance, with potential implications for the functioning of the bank’s AML/CFT measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our supervisors might detect information of this sort during an on-site inspection, and they can share it with the competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">At the same time, the prudential supervisor can use the insights gained by AML/CFT supervisors and reflect the AML/CFT-related concerns in its prudential tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It does so, for instance, when it grants authorisations to credit institutions; when it assess whether bank managers are fit and proper for their job; when it assesses acquisitions of qualifying holdings; and when it engages in ongoing supervision and the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">The job of AML/CFT supervisors, on the other hand, is to monitor and enforce the compliance of credit institutions and other obliged entities with the AML/CFT requirements that are set out in the applicable laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">We must therefore acknowledge that the two sets of supervisors play very different roles, and synergies are limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In order to improve cooperation between both sets of supervisors, the latest amendment to the AML Directive required the ECB to sign an agreement setting out the practical modalities for exchanging information with the AML/CFT supervisors of credit and financial institutions within the European Economic Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This agreement was signed in January this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And ever since, the ECB has been exchanging information under this framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Our initial experience has shown that it is particularly important to put in place robust formal procedures and exchange information in secure ways only when there is strong justification for doing so and based on well-defined relevance criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">All this is necessary to ensure the rights of the supervised banks are protected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There is a narrow line between enabling the appropriate flow of information and ensuring the confidentiality of this information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Aside from the ad hoc exchange of information, the ECB’s approach requires receiving assessments from AML/CFT supervisory authorities at least once a year to support its annual SREP, which is its main off-site supervision tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In exchange, the ECB shares relevant excerpts of SREP decision letters with AML/CFT supervisors on an annual basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Going into more detail, the ECB has also developed an approach to identify and reflect AML/CFT concerns in prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, as a primary information source, we factor the assessments from AML/CFT supervisory authorities into our prudential SREP assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We are also looking into possible prudential warning signals that would complement the assessments received from the AML/CFT supervisors by using our available supervisory data to highlight patterns that might indicate wrongdoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And second, we take the necessary action when required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This could range from sharing our concerns with the AML/CFT authorities to imposing supervisory measures to address prudential concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We could, for instance, require a bank to strengthen its general governance arrangements or reassess its board members and key function holders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.68,0)">We could even withdraw a bank’s licence as a last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Through performing these supervisory tasks, we can, to a certain degree, indirectly contribute to the goals of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And there’s more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Following on from the most recent enhancements to EU law, such as CRD V and the AML Action Plan, we are working together with the European Commission and the European Banking Authority, which is tasked with developing technical standards and guidelines to enhance and complement the amended regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">At the same time, we have actively contributed to the revision of the guidelines on the sound management of AML/CFT-related risks within the AML Expert Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.11,0)">How to strengthen the EU’s institutional setup While much has already been done, weaknesses in the European AML/CFT framework still represent a risk to the integrity and resilience of the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.18,0)">The current supervisory fragmentation and differences in supervisory practices in the area of AML/CFT can severely undermine the integrity and stability of EU banks and thereby the ECB’s supervisory effectiveness, particularly in a cross-border context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.12,0)">The steps taken so far might not be enough to effectively prevent money laundering and terrorist financing in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Thus, further steps might be considered by the political authorities to make the AML/CFT framework more effective, particularly for cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">We therefore welcome the ongoing discussion on what steps to take, and we stand ready to provide support in our areas of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.27,0)">However, as I said earlier, the ECB cannot take over the role of an AML/CFT supervisor; this is ruled out by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Furthermore, there are also only limited synergies between prudential supervision and AML/CFT supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">From our perspective, a strategy to strengthen the EU AML/CFT framework could comprise at least two elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.17,0)">First, a further harmonisation of the AML/CFT rulebook could address possible divergences and shortcomings in the way the rulebook was transposed in different Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It could also strengthen enforcement of AML/CFT compliance through AML/CFT supervisors by providing clear regulatory guidance and harmonised, stronger supervisory powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">This could be achieved by transforming the AML Directive into an EU regulation, which would have the potential of defining a harmonised anti-money laundering framework that is directly applicable throughout the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">To be effective, the scope of a future regulation should be as broad and encompassing as the legal base would allow, also with a view to moving towards a more rule-based approach, while fully respecting the legal constraints and the remaining variety of national institutional setups , particularly in the area of criminal law and justice systems .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Second, supervisory fragmentation should also be addressed, especially in relation to coordination and cooperation procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This could be achieved by charging an EU body or a new authority with AML/CFT tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This EU body or authority should be independent to allow it to act decisively in addressing ML/TF risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It could detail a single AML/CFT rulebook via technical standards and/or guidelines, coordinate its implementation and ensure strict and harmonised AML/CFT supervisory practices in the EU and across Member States, leveraging on the experience and expertise of national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The EU AML/CFT body should make sure that accurate and timely assessments on possible irregularities and ML/TF risks are proactively provided to prudential supervisors, including the ECB in its supervisory role , so these risks can be factored into their prudential assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Finally, if supported by co-legislators and primary law, the EU AML/CFT authority could be equipped with direct AML/CFT supervisory powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.58,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism are challenging endeavours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, they involve several areas of law at both the EU level and national levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Changes that lead to an efficient distribution of competences might imply the transfer of sovereignty from national to EU level within the existing Treaty framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Second, several types of authority play a role, including AML/CFT authorities and prudential supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.13,0)">There is a broad heterogeneity of institutional setups among Member States, involving judicial authorities limited to cooperation and implementation, as well as surveillance authorities attached either to the executive or judicial branch, and their interaction with prudential supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In other words, we need to reflect on the most effective way to manage the institutional and functional fragmentation in this area given its inherent cross-border nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.73,0)">All of this makes combating money laundering and terrorist financing complicated from both a legal and a practical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The battle can only be won through cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">All authorities involved need to cooperate – both within and across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">So I welcome the ongoing debates about a review of the regulatory framework and the possibility of establishing an EU AML/CFT body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Within the limits of its mandate, the ECB will continue to contribute to this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Important as this debate is, let’s not forget the responsibilities that supervised entities already have: to put in place and maintain internal systems and controls to ensure that they properly manage the risks to which they are exposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">For example, national setups of financial intelligence units.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.69,0)">Such as in the case of predicate offences for money laundering where, in line with Article 83  TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council only may, by means of directives, establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Information should be provided by the EU AML/CFT body to the coordination function in the SSM for SSM related AML/CFT tasks, acting as central point of contact.</span>
