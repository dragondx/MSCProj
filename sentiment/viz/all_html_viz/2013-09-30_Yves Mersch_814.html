    <h1> Towards a European Banking Union </h1>
    <h2> Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, The Bridge Forum Dialogue, Luxembourg, 30 September 2013 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)"> Towards a European Banking Union Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, The Bridge Forum Dialogue, Luxembourg, 30 September 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues and friends, It’s a pleasure for me to be back at the Bridge Forum Dialogue that we established in 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">13 years later, the original goal to bring together EU institutions established in Luxembourg and the actors and institutions of Luxembourg financial, economic and legal life with an EU outlook and to foster constructive dialogues across countries is more relevant than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">My speech today is about the advancement towards a banking union in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This step is essential to unravel the legacy of the financial crisis and will also be a cornerstone of a new Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">It goes beyond re-establishing the indispensable financial health of banks and securing the robustness of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">No other economic activity touches upon so many aspects of our lives as banking does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Banks must again become the dynamic engines of modern economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">But they must shed past excesses to fit in a new world with new regulations, new instruments and new institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.78,0)">Yet, in recent years, banks have been under tremendous stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.11,0)">Those at greatest risk have caused much pain, public outrage and destruction of wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.11,0)">But, most banks did not engage in directly hazardous activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Neither did the majority of bankers receive sky-high bonuses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.29,0)">Still, over the last two decades the global banking system has grown increasingly vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.98,0)">Most banks were undercapitalised, had fragile funding structures and – in hindsight – many engaged in unsound lending practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Several banks, primarily based in the US, thrived on complex structured investments, whose risks were not truly understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.43,0)">Rating agencies underplayed the potential risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.21,0)">Furthermore, a small number of banks plunged into dubious acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.71,0)">During this period, regulators and supervisors around the world did not keep pace with the complexity of financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.03,0)">Neither did they recognise the riskiness embedded in ever larger volumes of derivative instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.71,0)">Moral hazard, adverse incentives and – in some cases – sheer greed and anti-social behaviour resulted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.5,0)">Michael Sandel in his book “The moral limits of markets” asks: “Why worry that we are moving towards a society in which everything is up for sale?” and the answer is “For two reasons: one is about inequality, the other about corruption.” When systemic risks materialised in 2007- 2008, the world was struck by a sudden systemic financial crisis: unprecedented when measured by financial losses and fiscal costs; unprecedented when measured by its geographical reach; and also unprecedented when measured by the collapse in worldwide trade, economic output and financial activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.82,0)">We were on the brink of a global financial meltdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.49,0)">The ensuing “Great Recession” hit the euro area hard due to its high economic openness and financial exposures to a bank financed system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.33,0)">It triggered the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis, for which several distinct root causes were to blame.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.25,0)">As Tony Judt put it, we saw: “Uncertainty elevated to paroxysms of collective fear – which had corroded the confidence and institutions of liberalism.” Today I have two messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The first is that banks mirror their environment, but also contribute to shaping it in many respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Over long periods of time the soundness and credit standing of banks depends on good governance, shrewd planning, and their spirit of initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But, it also hinges on the dynamism of the economy, the sustainability of public and private finances, and the coherence of EMU’s architecture and political economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Sound banking regulation and supervision are also key: prevention must be the first line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, if adverse shocks hit or bank failures arise, there needs to be an effective crisis-management and resolution framework with credible backstops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.06,0)">Several of these elements were either weak or altogether missing in Europe and in Member States with a strong banking presence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">At the same time, monetary union needs banking union because sound banks are an essential complement to sound money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Banks are the main transmission channel of monetary policy to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The second message is that there were important similarities between banking developments and the evolution of the crisis across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But there were also relevant differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.92,0)">The crisis is now practically over in the US and other parts of the world, whereas it is only slowly tapering off in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">To understand how a European Banking Union can succeed we need to understand how we are now addressing all root causes of the sovereign debt crisis across countries and completing EMU’s architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will now address the following two questions, while offering some reflections along the way: What is being done to fix the root causes of the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">How do we shore up banks and what will the European Banking Union achieve?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.41,0)">What is being done to fix the root causes of the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">An important lesson from the sovereign debt crisis is that the “uniqueness of EMU” embeds systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It’s not possible to partake in a strong single market and a strong single currency vis-à-vis weakly coordinated national fiscal policies, economic policies and financial arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, at present, the single monetary policy is still transmitted in a regime of national banking regulation, supervision and resolution settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Another lesson is that we need to secure consistency between the various institutions, rules and instruments which now shape our political economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.3,0)">Thus, while the crisis was still unfolding, policy-makers started to redesign the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The most visible elements are a crisis management and resolution framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There are five adjustment programmes for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">They are jointly supported financially by the European Financial Stability Facility   and the permanent European Stability Mechanism  , plus the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Such risk-sharing in turn requires a strengthening of the governance framework to counter the moral hazard inherent in such an insurance scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And this is precisely what we have seen over the last three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">There is a new governance to restore fiscal sustainability and prevent or correct macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.36,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact has been tightened up by the so-called “six-pack” of economic governance measures, including the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They, in turn, have been complemented by the “two-pack”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Programme countries are undertaking painful domestic adjustment programmes which show first signs of getting them back on a sustainable track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Something new emerged at the June 2012 Summit of euro area leaders: glimpses of a shared European vision for a coherent and viable architecture of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The Presidents of the European Council  , the Eurogroup  , the European Commission   and the ECB   drew up what is known as the “Four Presidents’ Report”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The report backs a new architecture for European Economic and Monetary Union by creating four unions over the next decade: a banking union, comprising an integrated financial framework, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism or SSM and a bank resolution framework; a fiscal union, comprising an integrated budgetary framework that will go beyond the fiscal compact; an economic union, comprising an integrated economic policy framework; and a political union, enhancing the democratic legitimacy and accountability of all decision-making bodies within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These “four unions” are envisaged to mesh and engage with each other, like cogwheels in a mechanical apparatus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">Think of a finely crafted automatic watch: the spin of one wheel sets the others in motion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.87,0)">Conversely, when the momentum of one decreases, that of the others follows suit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The banking union, the fiscal union, the economic union and the political union can transmit and reinforce the dynamics of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Last year’s announcement concerning Outright Monetary Transactions reassured markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Confidence is slowly returning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Recent data show that growth and - following with a lag - job prospects are slowly improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Imbalances are gradually receding, while deleveraging and recapitalisation have started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">European countries can turn themselves around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Yet, while risks of extreme outcomes have receded, the situation is still very fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">We must exploit this room for manoeuvre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Hopefully, Jean Monnet was right when he noted that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">How do we shore up banks and the banking system, and what will a European banking union do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Looking ahead, how can we secure a level playing field for the banking system across Europe, reduce the risks of financial crises, reduce their impacts if they occur, and ensure that banks contribute to financial stability and prosperity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.05,0)">I will split this question into three parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, how do we fix the problems which all banks faced globally?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.87,0)">We have seen that there were relatively similar global failings in banking governance, risk management and capital adequacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Basel III is the basis for global banking reform efforts to increase the resilience of the banking system, recover market confidence and provide a level playing field for the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Basel III will provide the opportunity to ensure a harmonised set of prudential rules for all credit institutions across every country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the EU, Basel III is transposed through two pieces of legislation, namely the Capital Requirements Directive and the Capital Requirements Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Negotiations on these items of legislation, which will enter into force in January 2014, were very intense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We welcome the availability of uniform rules and standards but will have to make sure that they are also implemented in a common way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Thus we need to overcome all the waivers, exceptions as well as grandfathering claims and options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Andrea Enria, the Chair of the EBA with whom I shared a panel at a conference in Frankfurt last week, mentioned that more than 100 of such “flexibilities” still exist even in the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Second, what will a European banking union do and how will it work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.18,0)">The crisis has shown that an economic and monetary union cannot function without a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">We are now building one, from the ground up, to tackle the “doom loop”, curb financial fragmentation and enable banks to rebuild trust and provide a sustainable supply of credit to the real economy in every country and for every sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">About the SSM: first part – the micro-prudential The regulation for establishing a single supervisory mechanism   has recently been approved by the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is in the process of being finally agreed by the European Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The ECB will be the central authority of the SSM and it will be supported by national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Its mandate will be to supervise the whole banking sector of the euro area, plus those of any non-euro area Member State wishing to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.95,0)">The ECB will be entrusted with the whole toolbox for banking supervision including: authorising and withdrawing bank licences, collecting on and off-site information, undertaking on-site inspections in cooperation with the national supervisors, and validating banks internal models and risk controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Whenever necessary, the ECB will also be able to solicit additional capital, liquidity and other prudential requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is a huge set of responsibilities for which the SSM will draw extensively upon the expertise of national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The basis for SSM activity will be, as for any other supervisor in the EU, the Single Rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">But this is at a very high level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Embedded will be the ECB Supervisory Manual to install a single supervisory approach with sufficient granularity to overcome a fragmented regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">At the moment it appears that the ECB will directly supervise approximately 130 banks that are found to be “significant” according to the criteria laid down in the SSM Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.76,0)">This is less than 5% of all active euro area banks which are our counterparts in monetary operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Nevertheless, these cover around 85% of the total banking assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.56,0)">What about all the other banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Would it be realistic – or even desirable – for the ECB to supervise 6,000 additional credit institutions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Given also the wealth of expertise at the national level, and the advantages stemming from proximity in supervision, the answer is clearly “No”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">An efficient decentralisation of supervisory activities within the SSM will bring about effective decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But does a “two-tier system” imply different treatment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">No.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The difference between the two groups of banks will concern only the degree of centralisation of supervisory action within the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The “singleness of the SSM” is ensured by applying the same common supervisory approach to all banks: First, the Supervisory Manual will be binding for all Banks under SSM supervision, although some alleviated reporting might be envisageable for less significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Second, the national supervisory authorities will have to comply with ECB regulations, guidelines or general instructions; Third, the ECB will have access to all data of all banks; and Finally, the ECB, can decide to exercise supervisory powers directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.79,0)">We are facing a huge logistical challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">There is a vast amount of preparatory work which has to be ready 12 months after the regulation enters into force, including: selecting highly skilled staff; drawing up the final list of significant banks to be directly supervised by the ECB; harmonising supervisory approaches and reporting requirements; mapping the euro area banking system; developing a supervisory manual and publishing a framework regulation within six months after public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">These tasks are already completed by around ninety per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The next big challenge is the design and undertaking of the asset quality review  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The comprehensive balance sheet assessment is essential for ensuring that the SSM gets off to a good start and avoids reputational damage stemming from the possible emergence of problem banks in the early days of operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.72,0)">It is like a due diligence before the actual start of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It consists of a risk assessment which will be the basis of AQR, and the AQR will flow into a stress test to be jointly taken with EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All three elements must be completed before the SSM becomes operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Together they will allow a comprehensive view of banks’ balance sheets, bringing together quantitative and qualitative aspects of banks’ outstanding risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">Which risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">Risks already present, or ones that may emerge over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The AQR should therefore be a rather static, point-in-time exercise according to rigorous standards on all aspects of asset quality and with an emphasis on the level of provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">More forward looking assessments could then be provided in the baseline scenario of the stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">For us, this is an exercise on an unprecedented scale, and we will also call on external experts to enhance its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">About the SSM: second part – accountability and independence The SSM Regulation provides a clear separation between monetary policy and supervisory tasks, the latter entrusted to the newly established Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This organisational separation is necessary to comply the increased accountability requirements of the supervisory function and still respect the independence of the monetary policy function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">The Governing Council’s deliberations on supervisory matters will be strictly separated, including separate agendas and meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The SSM will also have its own accountability framework vis-à-vis the European Parliament, the Eurogroup and national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">It will apply to the Chair of the SSM’s Supervisory Board of the SSM, and not to the ECB’s President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This is intended to avoid any confusion among the two sets of tasks, also in the public perception, and further protects the ECB’s independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Last, over and beyond such clear separation of mandates, decision-making processes, rules and instruments between the two functions of the ECB - there need to be an exchange of information to reap synergies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Having for example the financial stability function and thus macro-prudential tasks under the roof of the central bank is of course nothing new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Different from the micro-prudential perspective it is there mostly docked at the National Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It therefore makes sense, to have different institutional arrangements for macro-prudential decision-making within the SSM than those that are foreseen for micro-prudential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the latter case there is a need for a clear separation of functions between the ECB as monetary policy-maker and supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The SRM – a necessary complement to the SSM For banking supervision to be effective, a Single Resolution Mechanism   is also indispensable to resolve non-viable banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.84,0)">Without an SRM, we might face a misalignment of incentives between the supervisory and the resolution functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.82,0)">Moreover, the supervisor’s judgments must also be enforceable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Commission recently proposed setting up a single resolution authority backed by a single bank resolution fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">The authority and the fund must be separate from the SSM, independent and supranational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">Jointly, they constitute a single resolution system with the ability to intervene directly in banks losses, dividing them among shareholders and creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Please note that if we are not going to have a joint SRM, beware that presently not all countries have a national resolution authority and fund: those ones have to set one up very rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.11,0)">In fact, supervisors could face a dilemma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.87,0)">On the one hand, there may be a danger of contagion and financial market panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.66,0)">On the other, supporting insolvent banks with central bank liquidity might give rise to “zombies” and weaken the credibility of banking supervision and resolution, and thus the banking union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Therefore, I strongly support the timeline envisaged for the SRM to start functioning on 1 January 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">An important prerequisite for the SRM is the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.26,0)">The Directive still has to be agreed with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In my view we should push for a start date of 2015 for bail-in so that we have the full resolution toolbox available from the outset – instead of over-extending the State Aid rules as a proxy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the future, the burden of a bank’s failure will be shifted away from the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">How?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Shareholders and creditors will be first to bear the resolution costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Only if this is insufficient should the banking industry as a whole step in via resolution funds – making the fiscal backstop the very last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To ensure adequate loss-absorbing capacity, each bank has to fulfil a minimum requirement of own funds and eligible liabilities for bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Third, what do we expect from banks and genuine banking integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.4,0)">The banking union is not an end by itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Is it instrumental?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.98,0)">And why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Because in the euro area about 80% of the financing of the real economy originates from the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Genuine banking integration is important in many respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Because a more integrated banking market intensifies competition by changing the focal point of the strategies of banks and other financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">More competition means that existing capital is allocated more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This promotes access to new funding opportunities for companies, encouraging investment and thus contributing to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Small and medium-sized enterprises with no direct access to capital markets may benefit most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">For the ECB, an integrated banking space eases monetary policy transmission and the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">A successful European banking union will also relieve the ECB of some of the tasks undertaken during the crisis and the need for non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Moreover, financial market integration helps smooth the effects of asymmetric shocks through income insurance when a country’s residents hold claims to dividends, interests and rental revenue from other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">In the US, such risk sharing has been shown to be far more important than federal budget transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.11,0)">Some final reflections Talking about flaws in EMU’s design is a bit reductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.4,0)">It certainly doesn’t capture the depth of the “repair work” going on in Europe and the euro area in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We are in fact adding new foundations to a framework that has brought us as far as it could, and that couldn’t cope with a systemic crisis: it actually aggravated it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Now, we need determination in completing the constitutional framework envisaged under the “four unions”, the four cogwheels that must work together in a synchronised manner and in one direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There must be no complacency: no “wait and see what happens
