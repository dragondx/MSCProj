    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> Central banking, insurance and incentives Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, ECB conference: “Debt, Growth and Macroeconomic Policies”, Frankfurt, 6 December 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is a pleasure to be here with you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">The underlying theme of this conference is the aftermath of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Papers on the implications of debt overhang, on the interaction between private and public indebtedness and on the sovereign debt crisis feature prominently in the conference programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">The aftermath of the financial crisis, which I will focus on tonight, however, has to do with the changes in the nature of monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Central bank liquidity has increased dramatically over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">“Unconventional” or “non-standard” measures have been deployed in all the main industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the ECB, such measures have always aimed at improving the transmission of standard policy decisions, but they have assumed different forms over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.37,0)">In the first phase of the crisis, they were mainly aimed at banks with the objective of preventing a collapse of the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">As the financial crisis has evolved into a sovereign debt crisis, we have stepped up the size of our operations with banks, and we have also aimed at removing redenomination risk from government bond markets through the decision on Outright Monetary Transactions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">As a monetary policy-maker, I am convinced that these measures were necessary to prevent the financial crisis from having further adverse consequences on both the financial system and on the macro economy and therefore, ultimately, on medium term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.53,0)">A freezing-up of the interbank market could have caused a credit crunch and a downward spiral in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.13,0)">The money supply would have shrunk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.24,0)">The ensuing collapse in aggregate demand would have put downward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.54,0)">A Great Depression scenario could have occurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.49,0)">The same scenario could materialise at local level in case of fear that countries could leave the euro, and severely hamper our ability to deliver price-stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Thanks to our non-standard measures, central bank liquidity has proved to be an effective insurance mechanism against the risk of an economic disaster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.19,0)">Providing insurance can, however, generate perverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.03,0)">Knowledge of the existence of a safety net can encourage imprudent behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.28,0)">Concern about this has been expressed in connection with our new OMT programme, under which we could purchase potentially unlimited amounts of sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.35,0)">By easing market pressure on governments, it is argued, ECB interventions could lead to a weakening of fiscal consolidation and reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The focus of my remarks tonight is this trade-off between insurance and incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I am going to start from the general principle of committing to provide partial insurance, which arises from the literature on microeconomics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I will then illustrate how our OMT programme and also the parallel plans for a banking union can be interpreted in the light of this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The basic principle: how to commit to partial insurance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.39,0)">The trade-off between insurance and incentives, or equivalently, between ex post efficiency and ex ante efficiency is a recurrent theme in microeconomics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">I will argue that this trade-off is a useful framework for thinking about the challenges we face in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">It is a widely studied topic, so we have been able to draw on and adapt existing insights when addressing those challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.49,0)">Why is there a trade-off?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.27,0)">Why is ex post efficiency not the same as ex ante efficiency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The reason is that we all react to the circumstances in which we operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">If circumstances change, so does our behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.14,0)">Thus, policies that ensure ex post efficiency are not necessarily efficient ex ante, because people react to those policies by altering their own behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">Ex post and ex ante efficiency generally do not overlap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Allow me for a moment to be somewhat schoolmasterly and use the example of car insurance to illustrate the basic trade-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Car insurance is obviously desirable ex post, since it is not optimal for people to bear the consequences of a car accident by themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">We are all more or less risk averse and feel much better when we have such car insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.14,0)">Without it, some of us would stop driving altogether if we had to fully pay for the consequences of an accident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Insurance improves ex post efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.22,0)">Mark Twain is credited with saying that: “ A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.67,0)">He describes a world that is not ex-post efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let’s now take an ex ante perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.06,0)">Carrying an umbrella does not encourage rain, but why drive carefully if we never bear the negative consequences of careless driving?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.78,0)">Insurance may well encourage imprudent driving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.15,0)">In other words, insurance hurts incentives, that is, it reduces ex ante efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The way to manage the trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency is through partial insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.16,0)">We are usually not fully insured against car accidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.03,0)">There is a deductible, a sum that we have to pay out of our own pocket if we file an insurance claim – in finance speak: we bear the “first loss”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.1,0)">Moreover, our insurance depends on the car we drive, our past record of insurance claims and also on whether it can be shown that we were negligent or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.75,0)">In other words, insurance companies worry about the behaviour that insurance induces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.39,0)">The trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency is apparent from the fact that if the deductible is too high, it may discourage insurance and therefore driving altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.53,0)">If, on the other hand, the deductible is too low, then drivers may become imprudent again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The same trade-off can be found in other policy domains – say, for example health care co-payments -, and, as I will argue next, in the relationship between outside investors and inside users of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.67,0)">The case of sovereign debt: insurance and incentives To some extent, a borrower’s income and hence his ability to repay debt is subject to forces outside his control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.12,0)">A bank, for example, cannot perfectly control its cash flow, which depends on what its competitors do and on general economic conditions, among other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.08,0)">Similarly, a country cannot perfectly control the business cycle; its income also depends on worldwide conditions that matter for its imports and exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.32,0)">At any moment in time, there can be mismatch between a borrower’s income and his expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">Without access to capital markets, without the ability to borrow, banks would have to cut lending and countries would have to limit the provision of services once their income dropped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The ability to borrow therefore insures against shocks to income and ensures the smooth functioning of an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Access to capital markets improves ex post efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.84,0)">But like car insurers, investors in capital markets worry about perverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.79,0)">Not so much about imprudent driving, but about some other forms of imprudence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.02,0)">A borrower’s income is not only subject to exogenous shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.74,0)">It is also the outcome of his decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.85,0)">Investors therefore worry that providing full insurance against the risk of income fluctuations can lead to irresponsible – for example, short-term-oriented – investment or policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.95,0)">When financing sovereigns, an additional and somewhat more fundamental problem arises: the so-called willingness to pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.59,0)">Governments cannot be forced or be contractually obliged to repay their debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.71,0)">Investors have to rely on the willingness of governments to make repayments, or else stop lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.77,0)">It is precisely this threat of the loss of access to capital markets that is analogous to the deductible in car insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is a form of partial insurance that provides incentives for governments to undertake good policy and to repay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">While a loss of access means less insurance against income shocks and hence less ex post efficiency, it improves ex ante efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.63,0)">The trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency automatically leads to a commitment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me go back to the example of car insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.64,0)">Providing only partial insurance, an insurance company expects drivers not to be imprudent so that accidents are indeed the result of bad luck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.8,0)">But once an accident has occurred, the insurance company could conceivably ignore the original contract and fully reimburse any claim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.41,0)">After all, the accident was then clearly due to bad luck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.71,0)">Anticipating this “renegotiation” and expecting full insurance after all, drivers have an incentive to become imprudent again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In practice, this is not a real problem for car insurance since insurance companies can credibly commit to sticking to the original contract But what about sovereign debt?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Would investors gain by nevertheless refinancing a government with a low probability to repay?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.76,0)">Or should they stick to shutting the country out of the market since they know that this improves incentives?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.38,0)">Past experience shows that sovereign debt has often been renegotiated as governments and investors find it difficult to commit to a given course of future actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As this hurts ex ante efficiency and thus leads to a higher cost of borrowing for governments, there have been a number of developments to make sovereign debt more “renegotiation-proof.” Just to give a couple of examples: Bonds started to replace loans in the market for sovereign debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.27,0)">Bonds, which are more widely held and easily tradable, make sovereign debt more difficult to renegotiate as the number of investors involved increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Another development is the shortening of the maturity of credit in order to exercise the control right   more often.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.34,0)">While these trends provide better incentives, they hurt insurance – maybe even excessively so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.09,0)">It may become excessively difficult to re-organise sovereign debt and to adapt to new circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">One possibility to counter the trend is to have collective action clauses  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">They offer the possibility of easier renegotiation by lowering the threshold for the number of bond-holders to agree to a debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.69,0)">Indeed, as of 1 January 2013, all new bonds issued by euro area governments will contain such clauses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.84,0)">Private markets with their various self-interests may, however, find it difficult to achieve a trade-off between incentives and insurance that is optimal for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.99,0)">In fact, markets can worry so much about incentives that they stop providing insurance altogether – in this case markets can freeze-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.09,0)">And indeed, we have experienced numerous quasi-market freeze-ups in various segments of the interbank, credit and sovereign debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">When this happens, it is time for the public sector to step in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.25,0)">But striking the right balance between insurance and incentives is also a problem for public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.74,0)">Full insurance produces perverse incentives irrespective of whether it is provided by a private or a public institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">One prominent example in the case of sovereign debt crises is the involvement of the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">In return for the insurance it provides by lending to countries in difficulty, the IMF usually receives far-reaching control rights to maintain or re-establish a country’s incentive for solid public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Without such far-reaching rights, interventions must take other forms to provide partial insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Financial assistance through the European Financial Stability Facility   during the sovereign bond crisis in the euro area has also drawn on the experience of the IMF – partly thanks to the involvement of the IMF itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">At the ECB we had the insurance-versus-incentives trade-off in mind when designing our new OMT programme and in our support of a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Before moving to the OMT and the banking union as topical and recent examples of the trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency, let me point out that while this trade-off is particularly stark in crises times, it is very much at the heart of central banking in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.44,0)">After all, the trade-off is inherent to liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.3,0)">Banking, by making long-term loans and financing them with deposits and other short-term debt, is inherently fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.06,0)">Maturity transformation exposes banks to liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The classic postulate of Bagehot, for a central bank to be a lender of last resort, but to perform that function at a penalty rate, illustrates both the need for   insurance and the need to safeguard incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.36,0)">In the words of Bagehot: “If the banks are bad, they will certainly continue bad and will probably become worse if the Government sustains and encourages them.”   The art of central banking is the art of balancing ex-ante and ex-post efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">OMTs and committing to partial insurance The purpose of the OMTs is to establish a backstop in the event of negative self-fulfilling market dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">We designed this new programme with features that are in line with an efficient trade-off between insurance and incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The first feature is to provide effective insurance against redenomination risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Under certain conditions, the ECB stands ready to intervene with amounts commensurate with this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">In other words, the scope for OMT interventions in government bonds markets is ex ante unlimited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This feature has been correctly interpreted as a commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">After three months, we can say that it has highlighted the value of commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.29,0)">In many countries, sovereign yield spreads edged down when the programme was announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.54,0)">Currently, yields stand at the lowest levels since the beginning of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.36,0)">The second feature of OMTs is that the insurance is partial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The objectives of the programme are clearly delimited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">The ECB will only buy bonds with shorter remaining maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB does not aim to eliminate all spreads between sovereign bond issuers, because sovereign yields don’t have to be identical in a monetary union, and market discipline has a role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Nor is the ECB willing to purchase any amount of sovereign bonds necessary to balance governments’ inter temporal budget constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">OMTs will remain consistent with a regime of “monetary dominance”,   in which governments retain the responsibility of balancing their budgets over the medium term and the ECB remains free to set interest rate so as to ensure the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The final feature of OMTs has to do with setting the right incentives for governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">To qualify for interventions, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a precautionary European Stability Mechanism   programme with strict and effective conditionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Conditionality serves to ensure that governments continue to correct existing economic and fiscal weaknesses when OMTs are activated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.44,0)">At the same time, OMT purchases will not take place while a country programme is under review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The ECB’s actions complement, but do not replace, economic and fiscal reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Incentives also help explain why interventions will focus on shorter-term debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.94,0)">Purchases of sovereign bonds will be suspended, should a country fail to comply with its conditionality requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Relying on short-term debt strengthens the disciplining power of the right to stop our interventions at any point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In short, OMTs strike the right balance between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency, and they are fully compliant with the ECB mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">A banking union and committing to partial insurance The OMTs can, however, only be part of a larger package to solve the European debt crisis, in which not only sovereigns but also banks have come under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.65,0)">In fact, both banks and sovereigns have been caught in a negative feedback loop, with the problems of one feeding on those of the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To break out of this loop, elements of a banking union are currently being discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">These elements need to be considered together and seen in the light of the trade-off between insurance and incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The first element of the banking reform is the creation of a single supervisory mechanism involving the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Besides the obvious coordination and information benefits for supervising banking in a financially integrated area, and given the risk of regulatory capture when the supervisor and the supervised are too close to each other, partially transferring supervisory authority up one level can be seen as a commitment not to renegotiate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It limits regulatory forbearance   and serves as an incentive for sound risk management in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It also ensures the singleness of banks’ liabilities in the euro area, congruent with the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Within the ECB, there should be a strict separation between the single supervisory mechanism and monetary policy, as a way to safeguard incentives when liquidity is extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">To quote Bagehot once again: “any aid to a present bad Bank is the surest mode of preventing the establishment of a future good Bank.”   Once incentives are upheld, it is possible and desirable to provide insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Incentive-compatible insurance must, however, be partial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And that is why it is important to add other elements to complement the single supervisory mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One such element is a European resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.56,0)">Since a bank’s debt should not be insured in full, it should, and in fact will, be possible for banks to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.2,0)">Since the beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   lists 466 cases in which banks in the United States failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.48,0)">Given the special role of banks as intermediaries, the failure of one bank can have adverse effects on the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.15,0)">Hence, it must be possible to organise an orderly failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.53,0)">Otherwise, failure is no longer credible and incentives for solid risk management are undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">To achieve an orderly resolution of financial institutions, especially systemic ones, we need a common resolution regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The existing legislative proposal for a Recovery and Resolution Directive aims at orderly bank resolution, including early interventions, bailing-in and bridge financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">A further important element of a credible and efficient resolution mechanism would be a common European Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The Recovery and Resolution Directive, together with the European Resolution Fund being financed by contributions from the industry, would ensure incentive-compatibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Similarly, the possibility to allow direct bank recapitalisations through the ESM can be an illustration of incentive-compatible insurance, provided that it is implemented once a single supervisory mechanism is established, and that any such recapitalisation is preceded by a burden-sharing exercise where shareholders and national taxpayers bear the first losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.49,0)">The euro area is going through a serious crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">For all European policy-makers, the crisis is a formidable challenge, but also an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and to improve the EMU architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">I believe that a number of decisive steps have been taken in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In designing such steps, the interplay of many different factors must be borne in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I have emphasised tonight that we cannot design insurance and forget about its impact on incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">When dealing with such complex issues, we have an unquenchable thirst for guidance from economic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Many of you in the academic community have written extensively on the potential consequences of our policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Rest assured: we closely follow your work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We may sometimes disagree with your conclusions, but you will always help us to focus our thoughts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I wish you a productive day at the conference tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">I wish to thank Florian Heider and Oreste Tristani for their contribution to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.59,0)">As so often in economics, the theme can be traced back all the way to Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” in 1776.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.87,0)">He describes how tenants underinvest in the land they do not own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.32,0)">Around the same time, in 1740, a version of the free-rider problem   appears in David Hume’s “Treatise of Human Nature”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.72,0)">Indeed, the trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency first appeared in modern economics in the context of “moral hazard” in insurance markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.2,0)">The incentive problem started to appear in   finance with M.
