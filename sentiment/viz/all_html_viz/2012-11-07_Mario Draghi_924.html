    <h2> Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at Wirtschaftstag 2012 "Kapitalismus in der Krise? Die Zukunft der Marktwirtschaft" der Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken organised by Genossenschaftsverband e.V., Frankfurt am Main, 7 November 2012 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> President’s address at Wirtschaftstag   Small- and medium-sized enterprises – and the banks that finance them – are the backbone of the German economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Your continued success is vitally important – not only for Germany, but also as a key driver of growth and employment in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">For this reason, you are a very important constituency for the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We pay close attention to your experiences and your views of the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For example, through surveys that we conduct twice a year, we are able to gather valuable information on the access to finance of smaller companies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.17,0)">The most recent survey was released only last Friday and relates to the period from April to September 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It contains information from about 7,000 small and medium-size firms throughout the euro area, of which around 1,000 are from Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The findings are encouraging for firms in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Banks remain willing to provide them with loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.1,0)">But the situation for SMEs in the euro area overall is more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.27,0)">Many are reporting a deteriorating financing situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.27,0)">The availability of bank loans for SMEs across countries has become increasingly divergent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.55,0)">These developments reflect the fact that the economic and financial situation in the euro area remains challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I would like to use my address today to discuss that situation and to share with you the ECB’s views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will focus on two themes in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">My first theme will be the important steps being taken by governments to put the euro area on the path back to stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Individually, they are addressing their deep-rooted economic challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Collectively, they are working to strengthen the foundations of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">My second theme will be the measures taken by the ECB to maintain price stability and to remove unfounded fears about the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">These measures are essential to ensure that our low interest rates are passed through to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">The current economic situation Let me begin with the current situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">Unemployment is deplorably high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.92,0)">Overall economic activity is weak and it is expected to remain weak in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.34,0)">And the growth of money and credit are subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this context, inflation is well contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.04,0)">We expect it to fall below 2% next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Germany has so far been largely insulated from some of the difficulties elsewhere in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.52,0)">But the latest data suggest that these developments are now starting to affect the German economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is also evident in the KfW-ifo-Mittelstandsbarometer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">Germany is an open and integrated economy, so it is not surprising that a slowdown in the rest of the euro area has an impact here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Intra-euro area trade amounts to around 40% of German GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And around 65% of foreign direct investment in Germany comes from other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.92,0)">But it is less often noted how problems in the wider euro area affect the financial situation in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">It is the weak euro area economy that is keeping interest rates here at very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.16,0)">And it is the crisis of confidence in some euro area countries that is causing safe-haven flows of money into Germany, depressing interest rates even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This highlights the fact that countries in a single currency area are connected like communicating vessels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">A change in one vessel creates an equal change in all the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.14,0)">As interest rates rise in countries in difficulty, they fall in strong countries like Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.8,0)">As TARGET2 liabilities increase in some countries due to capital outflows, TARGET2 claims increase in Germany due to capital inflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.91,0)">Financial developments in Germany are the mirror-image of financial developments in the rest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">And this means that measures to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole will also be to the benefit of Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">So let me now turn to the actions being taken by governments to achieve that goal of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Actions by governments to restore stability Across the whole euro area, governments are making determined efforts to reverse economic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">They are implementing reforms to redress the misguided policies of the past and to create sustainable long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.17,0)">It is a difficult road and there is still a long way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">But the early signs are encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation is progressing well in most countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The International Monetary Fund   forecasts that the euro area’s primary budget will be almost in balance this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.38,0)">By comparison, Japan will have a primary deficit of 9% of GDP, the United States 6.5% and the UK more than 5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">We are also seeing some noteworthy improvements in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Price competitiveness has improved significantly in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.98,0)">And current account deficits are falling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For example, the countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen their unit labour costs improve by more than 10% since 2008, relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Their current accounts have improved by around 8% of GDP since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Governments have also taken measures to strengthen the rules and institutions that guide economic policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is important to ensure that the positive developments do not simply reverse when economic conditions improve and markets stabilise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">One notable example is the new fiscal compact, which will provide a strong tool for keeping budgets close to balance in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Governments have also set up a new framework to prevent and correct unsustainable developments in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In short, some hard work has been done in the euro area to unwind imbalances and to reinforce governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.39,0)">But there is still a lot more hard work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Maintaining the current momentum of reform is essential for putting the euro area on the path back to stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Fragmentation in monetary policy transmission Let me now turn to the measures being taken by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.85,0)">The confidence crisis and the process of adjustment across the euro area has weighed on short-term growth and dampened inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.53,0)">To maintain price stability, the ECB has lowered its interest rates to historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.49,0)">But before August this year, our low interest rates were not reaching companies and households evenly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In some countries, interest rate reductions were being fully passed on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.65,0)">In others, lending rates barely declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">And in a few countries, they had actually risen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.81,0)">This divergence happened because banks in some countries had found it increasingly expensive to obtain funding from market sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.72,0)">They therefore could not pass on the lower interest rates to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.17,0)">This meant that monetary policy was unable to support the real economy in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.35,0)">Smaller companies were affected the most, as was clear from our surveys of SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.53,0)">And as companies in the euro area are very dependent on bank loans for financing, some economies were being forced into a damaging cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.46,0)">Economic activity was weakening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.32,0)">Public finances were deteriorating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.23,0)">Banks and governments were being forced to pay even higher interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.52,0)">And credit and economic growth were then falling further, leading to rising unemployment and reduced consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.44,0)">This situation posed serious risks not only for the countries concerned, but for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.14,0)">It was hindering the overall economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.5,0)">It was even damaging the single market, as healthy companies were being curtailed in financing solely because of their location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.54,0)">If this situation had been left unaddressed, it could have created a risk of deflation and threatened the ECB’s ability to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">That is why we decided that action was essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Understanding the ECB’s response How did the ECB respond to this situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.47,0)">In our analysis, a key reason why our low interest rates were not being passed on was that, earlier this year, some investors had become influenced by imagined scenarios of disaster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.66,0)">They were therefore charging very high interest rates to governments and private borrowers in countries they perceived to be most vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">These interest rates went beyond levels warranted by economic fundamentals and justifiable risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Interest rates do not have to be identical across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.22,0)">But it is unacceptable if the reason for large differences is the fragmentation of capital markets caused by fears of a euro area break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.75,0)">It was clear to us that governments could not address these break-up fears alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The only way to restore market confidence and the proper transmission of our monetary policy was a fully credible backstop against disaster scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Our new programme of Outright Monetary Transactions provides this backstop by allowing for unlimited interventions in government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">This commitment has generated a lot of debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But we have to understand how markets work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Our actions have to send a clear signal to markets that their fears about the euro area are baseless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is important to stress that ‘unlimited’ does not mean uncontrolled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Most importantly, to qualify for interventions, countries must have agreed a European Stability Mechanism   programme with strict conditionality and IMF involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB will only intervene if the policy conditions under that programme continue to be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Conditionality is very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It ensures that countries continue to reform while the ECB is active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.99,0)">It provides a clear basis for us to terminate our operations if the programme is not complied with in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">And it also protects the ECB’s independence, as we will not be forced to substitute for a lack of actions by governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.3,0)">Consequences of the ECB’s actions So what can citizens expect will be the consequences of the new programme?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let me emphasise three key points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, our actions will not lead to disguised financing of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Interventions will take place solely on the secondary market, where bonds already issued are traded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is fully consistent with the Treaty’s prohibition on monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And since we will only purchase bonds with a remaining maturity of between one and three years, there will still be ample room for market discipline on governments at longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Second, our actions will not lead to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.88,0)">The weak overall economic situation, combined with slow money growth, means that the risks of inflation are currently very low over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Our interventions will not change this outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.32,0)">In fact, for every euro we inject with our interventions, we will withdraw a euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">So they will not affect monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.71,0)">Furthermore, we see no signs that our announcement has affected inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">They are firmly anchored because we have always delivered price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">And citizens can trust that we will continue to do so: price stability remains our mandate and our sole objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Third, our actions will not lead to greater risks for taxpayers in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Taxpayers are protected by the fact that our interventions will take place only in countries with sound economic and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Their continued commitment to these policies will be ensured by the ESM programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">And the ECB will assess compliance with this programme in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Moreover, by normalising conditions in financial markets, our actions will help reverse the capital flows into Germany that are creating some distortions here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">This should ultimately support the savers, pension funds and insurance companies that depend on interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And it should reduce TARGET2 imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In other words, ECB actions that support market confidence are of benefit not only to countries in difficulty, but also to the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our measures ensure the proper transmission of monetary policy, which means neither excessively high interest rates nor excessively low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The measures enable the ECB to continue to maintain price stability for the benefit of all citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The announcement on OMTs has already triggered positive effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Sentiment in financial markets has improved significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Excessive government bond spreads have gone down, a number of banks in stressed countries have been able to regain access to markets and Target2 balances have broadly stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The way forward Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Actions by the ECB can build confidence in the euro area in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">But only actions by governments can secure confidence in the euro area over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In particular, governments need to work together to establish a stronger institutional structure for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This process began in June this year with what has been called the “Four Presidents’ Report”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">That report – of which I am a co-author – identified four key pillars on which a stable and prosperous monetary union should be built.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These pillars are financial union, fiscal union, economic union and political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the near term, the most important pillar is financial union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Financial union is essential in a single currency area where cross-border capital flows can lead to credit booms and other imbalances – and where the negative effects of a bust can spread rapidly to other members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">One essential part of financial union is a single banking supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As you know, the European Commission has recently proposed that the new supervisor should be based at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is important to ensure consistency across the euro area and to prevent regulatory capture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Day-to-day tasks, however, would remain with national supervisors who have the competence and resources to implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.14,0)">But financial union does not have to imply the pooling of deposit guarantee schemes, an issue that I know is of concern in this country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Organising and funding deposit guarantee schemes can remain a national responsibility, with comparable effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In the longer term, all four pillars are equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">They are the bedrock for the enormous potential of the single currency for Europe’s citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Completing economic and monetary union would give citizens greater security against any future crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">It would create the foundations for sustainable growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For all citizens of the euro area, it is therefore essential that Europe’s leaders stay on course.</span>
