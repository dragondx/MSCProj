    <h1> The external value of the euro </h1>
    <h2> Remarks by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 3rd DVFA/GMCC Dinner on 3 December 1998 in Frankfurt am Main </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)"> The external value of the euro Remarks by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 3rd DVFA/GMCC Dinner on 3 December 1998 in Frankfurt am Main Economic and Monetary Union will start in four weeks' time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.14,0)">On 31 December 1998 the Deutsche Mark and nine other national currencies will fade from the computer screens that thousands of foreign exchange traders have used for years to determine the course of the exchange rates for our economies, price and other economic developments, gains and losses for millions of households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On 1 January 1999 the euro will be introduced legally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">Three days later - on the first trading day of 1999 - the European Central Bank will conduct its first repo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A single monetary policy for eleven European countries will then start to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">This enterprise has no precedent because the perimeter of the euro area embraces a number of countries that have retained their sovereignty in many crucial respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I said EMU will start in four weeks time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.21,0)">I could have said, however, that it has started today around 2 p.m. As you all certainly know, at that time all national central banks of the euro area have lowered their key central bank rates in a co-ordinated decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The importance of this move cannot be overstated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It reflects, as the ECB press release of today indicates, "a thorough discussion in the ECB's Governing Council leading to a consensus on the basis of a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">While, as you know, future monetary policy decisions will be taken with a majority rule, this one is equivalent to a unanimous vote of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is the result of a convergence of view of all the decision making bodies of all the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It shows, to those who may have had doubts, that the primary objective of price stability is not an obstacle to a timely downward movement in the rates when it is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Finally, and very importantly, it sets "the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three of Monetary Union and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me say that the final phase of the transition from eleven to one monetary policy could not have occurred in a more efficient and harmonious manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The theme of my remarks tonight is the external value of the euro, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">its value for the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I shall not try to deviate from the expected substance of this theme: the place of the euro in the international monetary system, its relationship with the other key currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But let me start with what I regard as "the" answer to the question underlying the title of my speech: the external value of the euro will be primarily determined by its internal value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The guiding principle of our monetary policy will be to maintain price stability, and we -that is the members of the two key decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank   and hence of the European System of Central Banks   - firmly believe that our performance in this respect will be the key determinant of the international value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">With this in mind, the Governing Council of the ECB has recently defined the strategic aspects of the monetary policy it will follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It has thus completed the preparatory work on the monetary policy framework which started with the selection of the instruments and procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Since this was done just two days ago and is pertinent to the theme of my speech tonight, let me spend a few words on it before going to the heart of my subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">In communicating our monetary policy strategy to the public, we have done our best to ensure maximum clarity and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">While for any central bank clarity and transparency are vital to establish credibility and ensure the success of its policy actions, this is particularly true for a new-born central bank such as the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.18,0)">Designing a monetary policy strategy for the ECB has not been easy because Economic and Monetary Union is likely to prompt profound changes in economic and financial behaviour in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.59,0)">Inevitably, these changes create a special uncertainty, and our efforts to predict them cannot be expected to be entirely successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB therefore had to adopt a strategy that reflects the special features of the shift to a new monetary regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.03,0)">The three main elements of the strategy should be recalled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, we have formally defined the primary objective assigned by the Treaty, namely price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">For the ESCB - as was decided in October - price stability means a year-on-year increase in prices for the euro area as a whole of less than 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">First, this definition acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the so-called measurement bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, it emphasises that the single monetary policy cannot be used to solve regional or national problems; it will apply to the entire euro area, just as the Deutsche Bundesbank's policy has so far applied to the whole Bundesrepublik.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.45,0)">And, third, the word "increase" implies that both persistent inflation and deflation are incompatible with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Price stability is to be maintained in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The second element of the strategy is the prominent role given to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This has been reflected in the adoption by the Governing Council, the day before yesterday, of a reference value of 4 1/2% for the growth of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The reference value will be revised annually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It should be emphasised that the ECB did not wish to lock itself into a monetary target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.18,0)">Given the uncertain environment, this would have been simply too risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.42,0)">Thus, while deviations from the reference value would normally signal risks to price stability, there is no commitment to mechanically correct deviations whenever they may arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.05,0)">The ECB, through its President and the other members of the Governing Council, will of course regularly explain to the public how its interpretation of the actual behaviour of money relative to the reference value has affected its policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The third element is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments that includes an analysis of an array of economic and financial indicators other than money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">Here again, we shall regularly explain to the public the impact that this analysis has had on our decisions to change, or not to change, interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We are confident that this strategy will maintain price stability in the euro area, thereby preserving the internal value of the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This will also satisfy the key condition for the euro to play a positive role internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let now me come to the core of the subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.56,0)">And I begin by noting that, given the sheer size of the future euro area, any reflection about the external value of the euro is also a reflection about exchange rate relationships at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The introduction of the euro, unique as it may be for Europe, will not, by itself, modify the exchange rate regime in which the world is living at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This is a regime of floating exchange rates and is the outcome of developments that have occurred over thirty or forty years: a greater balance in the relative economic size of the leading countries, the tendency of economic policies to pursue primarily domestic objectives, the liberalisation of capital movements, the growing role of markets, the deregulation of domestic markets and, last but not least, the spectacular advances in technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.18,0)">These developments have fundamentally affected the ability of the monetary authorities to control exchange rates on which the Bretton Woods system had been built.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A highly integrated world financial system has taken over from official authorities the role of both exchange rate determination and the international allocation of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">As is shown by its most recent crisis, this system has also acquired the capability to rapidly transmit the consequences of errors in private investments and public policies throughout the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The priority assigned by the large countries and currency areas to domestic objectives explains why in recent years policy co-ordination at the global level has been essentially of a non-binding nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">This has not precluded occasional active co-operation between the three main currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Co-ordinated action to stabilise world exchange rates was agreed, for example, by the major industrialised countries at the Plaza meeting in September 1985 to halt the appreciation of the US dollar, and with the Louvre Accord of February 1987 to prevent its undesired depreciation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">However, large countries have always refrained from committing themselves to formal exchange rate arrangements or pre-defined rules for their management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">My expectation is that the introduction of the euro will not change this attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">The present international financial system is indeed a "fact of life".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This does not mean that it is the best of all worlds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.84,0)">The Mexican financial breakdown in late 1994 and, in the last fifteen months, the crisis in East Asia and the spread of the ensuing turmoil to Russia and, to some degree, to eastern Europe and Latin America later on, have raised legitimate questions about the inherent stability of the present system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.56,0)">Earlier, in the 1990s, Europe had experienced a currency crisis of its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.87,0)">Huge pressure was brought to bear indiscriminately on various currencies participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.41,0)">Today, it is recognised that the main underlying cause of the near-breakdown of the arrangement in the summer of 1993 was what academics call a "co-ordination failure", including uncompromising priority given to domestic objectives on the part of national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In a fully liberalised financial world, market participants exploited in full the possibility of making profits out of the co-ordination failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The European currency crisis provided a striking confirmation of the well-known proposition that free trade, complete freedom of capital movements, fixed exchange rates and autonomous national monetary policies cannot coexist for very long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The four elements constitute what I have called on other occasions an "inconsistent quartet".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">And I do think that the inconsistent quartet constitutes a most useful paradigm to understand international economic and monetary relationships both at the European and at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Europe has now reconciled the inconsistent quartet by moving from autonomous national monetary policies to monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I have long been convinced that for our countries this was the only way to preserve unrestricted trade and the freedom of capital movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.88,0)">Monetary union has not only been an act of political will; it has also been the recognition that, in a region that has achieved an unprecedented degree of economic and financial integration, destabilising capital flows could destroy the single market and hence a primary source of our prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.05,0)">At the global level, it is the third element of the inconsistent quartet -fixed exchange rates -which has been given away, and this happened 25 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.4,0)">Like Europe, the world cannot do without free trade and high capital mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Unlike Europe, it has neither the possibility nor the willingness to bind monetary policies to an objective of exchange rate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As I have just said, when the increase in capital mobility generated the dilemma, domestic objectives took precedence over external ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The rather compelling logic of the inconsistent quartet does not mean, however, that exchange rate stability world-wide is not desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my view, it is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.38,0)">Indeed, abrupt changes in exchange rates may generate calls for protectionism and restrictions on capital flows that would eventually erode free trade and hence economic efficiency and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Very few would claim that these outcomes are desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">While recognising that stable exchange rates are desirable not only for Europe but also elsewhere, I largely concur with those who have expressed serious doubts about the idea of setting ranges for the fluctuations of the major currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.43,0)">Even if one disregards, for a moment, the inconsistent quartet and the potential conflict with domestic price stability  , I see three specific difficulties in establishing such ranges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, the participants in the system would need to agree on mutually consistent values for the central rate of the target ranges, both in nominal and in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.4,0)">This, in turn, means that they would have to agree on the resulting pattern of current account deficits or surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.18,0)">Clearly, this is not just a technical matter, since the presence of a large US current account deficit, a legacy of the 1980s that is not likely to disappear soon, makes an agreement on exchange rates difficult to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">If a long-term agreement on exchange rates were negotiated, exporters both in Europe and in the United States would be likely to press their respective authorities to obtain a "favourable" rate of exchange for their currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The current account situation of the United States would be a powerful argument for US exporters to convince their authorities that a substantial depreciation of the dollar would be desirable - and hence an appreciation of the euro and the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, this would be resisted in Europe and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.41,0)">An agreement could thus prove impossible, and this could even strengthen protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.27,0)">Second, a major shift in the monetary regime of an area as large as Europe would make it difficult to estimate equilibrium exchange rates for the three major currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.93,0)">Estimating equilibrium rates is a very complex exercise under any circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">Today, such an effort would be virtually impossible, given that we simply do not have a historical record of the determinants of the external value of the new European currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.85,0)">Even a qualitative assessment of how the euro will tend to move, compared with its predecessor European currencies, would be very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.37,0)">The recent debate on the possible role of the euro as an international reserve currency shows the extent of the disagreement amongst economists on whether this role will expand or shrink compared with the role played hitherto by the Deutsche Mark, and whether the euro will depreciate or appreciate as a result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.45,0)">Third, and to my mind most decisively, the so-called target zones are subject to the same inherent fragility that affects all "adjustable peg" systems and that ultimately caused the end of the Bretton Woods regime and the virtual suspension of the ERM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.96,0)">This is the risk of being destabilised by market forces, due to the well-known difficulties in agreeing on timely changes in the reference values required by changes in economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.76,0)">Thus, while world-wide exchange rate stability is desirable, a system that tries to enforce it mechanically may just not be practicable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">12.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Against the background of the inconsistent quartet theory and in the light of the difficulties entailed in a return to formal agreements on exchange rate management, one may wonder what is the key to stable international monetary relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">As long as we live in a world of sovereign States, the core answer to this question is: sound domestic policies and sound institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">If the two pillars of sound policies and sound institutions were firmly established, then the task left to international policy co-ordination would not be disproportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me say a few more words about these two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">13.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Sound economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The relationship between domestic policies and the external value of a currency was vividly illustrated by the behaviour of the US dollar in the early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Between 1982 and 1985, international capital flowed into the United States in large amounts as a consequence of the opening-up of a large and chronic budget deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.87,0)">The scale of the inflows was so large that it drove up the dollar to a level which exacerbated the current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.08,0)">The massive overvaluation of the dollar was a spectacular example of the tendency of foreign exchange markets, with floating exchange rates and mobile capital, to generate wide and prolonged misalignments in exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.66,0)">This was not the result of a market imperfection, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">On the contrary, markets behaved just like any macroeconomic textbook would have predicted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.95,0)">The overvaluation of the dollar occurred in parallel with a massive fiscal expansion and the monetary policy tightening that responded to it: an "unbalanced policy mix", as economists call it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">14.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We should not forget that episode, because also for the euro area the policy mix will be a major determinant of the external value of the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Today, prices in the euro area are stable, interest rates - whether short or long, nominal or real - are at historically low levels, and economic growth is supported by the stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.63,0)">There is a similar situation in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.05,0)">A scenario like the one that occurred in the United States in the early 1980s does not seem likely to develop in Europe or in the United States in the current circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.81,0)">The situation, however, would change if the currently perceived risks of fiscal relaxation in Europe were to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.71,0)">The European policy mix might then become unbalanced, and market developments could adversely affect long-term interest rates and theexchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These risks should be considered carefully when assessing the stance of fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Reducing deficit and debt levels must therefore remain the objective of European governments, in particular where the public debt is large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This is a pre-condition for a balanced policy mix, one that will keep interest rates low and make the euro a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.5,0)">You may say that this is the traditional central banker's argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.14,0)">Yes, it is; but that does not mean that it is not valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Sound institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.82,0)">Until recently, abundant capital had flowed into emerging countries, which were eventually unable to handle inflows of such a magnitude, partly because of a mismanagement of external liabilities, weak domestic banking systems and insufficiently sound institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.3,0)">When capital left these countries, it did it so very quickly, causing a major currency   crisis, with severe damage to the economies concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I do not believe that globalisation per se was the cause of the crisis, although some aspects of it - such as information technology, financial innovation and the easy flow of capital across borders - may have contributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The problem is that the development of a global financial market and the rise of the emerging economies have not been accompanied by the parallel improvement in the legal and regulatory infrastructure that is always needed, both nationally and internationally, for markets to function properly and to be reasonably stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.22,0)">The current crisis is, to a large extent, the result of such an imbalance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.94,0)">The Asian crisis has thus been just another reminder that, at the end of the day, the issue underlying the stability of currencies is the set of policies that engender   stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.98,0)">Sound policies and institutions cannot be "replaced", so to speak, by a link between the domestic currency and another currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">There is nothing wrong with such a linkage  , but the currency must be tied at a competitive level and, most importantly, must be backed by sound domestic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">What has been true for the long-term participants in the international financial system also applies to those who have joined the system more recently, and will apply to future newcomers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.27,0)">17.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">My insistence on the role of sound domestic policies and sound institutions does not imply that international arrangements and multilateral organisations have no role to play in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In a global economy made up of about 200 sovereign States, multilateral arrangements integrate the policy architecture by providing the incentives to improve national institutions and policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">They should be strengthened, not undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">To this end, a number of initiatives are under way that, if implemented successfully, could significantly improve international discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These concern such areas as transparency, accountability, practices for supervision, payment and settlement systems, accounting standards and disclosure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">International standards should be agreed and applied broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">18.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It's time for me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.01,0)">The revival of a discussion about the international monetary system is in part the consequence of a series of turbulences that started - just after the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions - with the Mexican crisis of 1994, and went on last year and this year with the Asian crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A serious debate, with proposals, has now started on the ways and means to promote sound macroeconomic management, sound institution building and a more efficient working of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Our aim should be to maximise the benefits to be derived from globalisation without having to suffer from its tendency to spread instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I am persuaded that the creation of the euro, with its profound implications for political and economic life in Europe, will give impetus to this renewed thinking, and that it will provide the world with a striking example of how far sovereign nations can push their co-operative spirit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It will also bring to the international fora a new voice, strongly imbued with that same spirit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Tonight I have shared with you my conviction that sound economic policies and strong institutions are, today as in the past, the key factor in achieving stability in international economic, financial and monetary relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">They are, therefore, the key to establishing and preserving the external value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">You can be sure that our work, at the ECB, is - and will continue to be - guided by these principles.</span>
