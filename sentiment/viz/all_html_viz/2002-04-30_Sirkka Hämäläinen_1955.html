    <h3> Speaker: Sirkka Hämäläinen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> Consolidation in the European securities infrastructure - what is needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Sirkka Hämäläinen, Launch of the ECB-CFS research network on "Capital markets and financial integration in Europe", Frankfurt am Main, 30 April 2002 I am delighted to speak today before such a distinguished audience of economists interested in the role of capital markets in the European integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I will be talking about an issue that has only recently started to attract the level interest it deserves from senior economists and analysts: namely, securities market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The previous speaker, Alberto Giovannini, is one of the most prominent analysts in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The work and results of his group concerning the barriers to integration in the area of clearing and settlement arrangements have already generated a long list of topics for research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I shall comment on the same topic and present some of the principles and needs that the Eurosystem is supporting and promoting in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The starting-point By eliminating currency segmentation, the introduction of the euro has naturally been a major factor in the integration of European financial markets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">From the outset of the single currency, the large-value payment systems of the euro area have been connected through the TARGET system and a euro area- wide money market, necessary for single monetary policy, has been created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The need for collateral in money market transactions provides a special incentive to the cross-border use of securities in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The consolidation process triggered by the single currency has been supported by other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The implementation of the Investment Services Directive has introduced a "single passport" policy for market participants in trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This allows each market participant in a regulated or organised domestic market to be recognised in the regulated or organised markets of other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Advances in technology have allowed stock exchanges and settlement systems to overcome the obstacle of location, and remote access can now be offered to financial intermediaries anywhere in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.68,0)">These factors have naturally altered the competitive position of national securities service providers, such as stock exchanges and securities settlement systems, transforming them from locally protected institutions to competitors in a cross- border context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Under market pressures, an overly fragmented industry is now engaged in an important consolidation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.89,0)">Despite all these developments, the securities infrastructure in the euro area today remains highly fragmented, with a large number of stock exchanges, derivative exchanges, regional exchanges and various regulated trading systems as well as several national clearing and settlement institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.15,0)">No other currency area has ever had to cope with such a highly fragmented securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.6,0)">This fragmentation, the natural inheritance of the infrastructures of its member countries, is both a challenge and an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.55,0)">It is a challenge because a cumbersome process of reshaping the current state of the infrastructure is inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">But it is an opportunity because it allows the euro area to create a new infrastructure of the highest standard in terms of efficiency and safety.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">How will the domestic infrastructure for the euro develop?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">There is increasing co-operation and competition among service providers pointing towards the integration of the securities infrastructure in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Different models of integration can be identified in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">One approach is the establishment of branches, with local partners using a common technology to access regional markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is the strategy that is promoted by NASDAQ, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Another approach consists of mergers between service providers; here Euronext and Euroclear are prominent examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Furthermore, a strategy of hostile take-overs could be attempted, along the same lines as the Swedish OM Group's attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Finally, some benefits of consolidation can still be realised through softer forms of co-operation such as the interconnection of service providers through a common electronic interface.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Although these factors seem to suggest that the securities infrastructure will start to look something like a "domestic" infrastructure for the euro, there is the question of whether the consolidation process will proceed without some form of public involvement - in addition to the national harmonisation in the fragmented legislation which is the self-evident responsibility of the public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In a competitive environment, market forces in principle push for the most efficient solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But how competitive is the European securities infrastructure?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.31,0)">Is there any evidence to suggest that some market players are abusing their dominant positions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.12,0)">Are there any market failures to support the argument for public action?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">And, in particular, will market pressures be sufficient to overcome existing national interests?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.59,0)">An analysis of the business environment for securities trading, clearing and settlement indicate the existence of several sources of insufficient competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will not attempt to provide any extensive analysis in this regard, but would just like to touch upon some questions illustrating why there could be a need for public intervention in order to achieve consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The recent report of the Giovannini Group identified a number of barriers to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement in the EU which reduce or even eliminate competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Alberto Giovannini and his group have continued, and are continuing - as we know - the analysis of public policy aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">There are service providers, for example custodian banks, who may actually benefit from fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They specialise in providing services for market participants who are active in several markets, acting as a single access point to many different systems in many different markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.67,0)">If these service providers are at the same time the owners of the fragmented settlement systems, they naturally have little interest in pursuing a consolidation policy which would eventually jeopardise their own business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.74,0)">Similarly, conflicting shareholder interests or the protection of perceived national interests may hamper the co-ordinated consolidation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.17,0)">In general terms, the markets have difficulties in allocating the overall benefits that can be reaped from the shift to a consolidated infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Those who would bear the costs of integration are not necessarily the same players who would derive the most benefits from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.17,0)">In addition, there is a timing difference which produces conflicts between short-term and long-term gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.62,0)">Obviously, the complexity of the different interests at stake has an impact on the competitive environment of the securities service industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">One important aspect of consolidation concerns the role of the banks and their competitive position in providing securities services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Some banks have been expanding their trading, clearing and settlement capacity by investing heavily in their own in-house systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">They trade, clear, settle and deposit transactions in-house rather than forwarding them to the clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Some are also setting up separate legal entities, which provide these services to other financial intermediaries, like fund managers, brokers/dealers and the smaller banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This development is based on the fact that the costs of a transaction are in some cases lower within a single bank than in the market, and custodian banks therefore opt for "insourcing" or internalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.15,0)">Here we are faced with the question of the implications of this insourcing on the consolidation process as such.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Important open questions also arise with regard to the regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When different kinds of market players offer the same services, they should be subject to the same regulatory requirements regardless of whether they are qualified as banks or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.84,0)">The question is typical of financial conglomerates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">What kind of regulatory reform is needed in the area of oversight and prudential supervision policy to ensure a regulatory level playing field for all market players?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There are interesting historical examples demonstrating that the current infrastructures in many countries are partly the result of some form of public intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the United States , the Securities and Exchange Commission took a leading role in the mergers of different institutions when restructuring the national securities infrastructure in 1976.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In Italy , Banca d'Italia played a major role in establishing a new settlement system in the late 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In France , some 20 years ago, the "Rapport Perouse" launched a substantial restructuring and consolidation of the French trading industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And the so-called Big Bang in the United Kingdom in 1986, among other things, also involved the introduction of electronic trading and a new settlement system; after the failure of the project, the Bank of England established a Task Force on securities settlement in 1993, which led to the establishment of the central securities depository in the United Kingdom three years later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These historical examples are all very different but they have two points in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, they all involved some form of public intervention either by the legislator, the securities regulator, or the central bank in order to effect changes in the national securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, the interventions all sought to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the domestic securities industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Given the current degree of fragmentation of the securities infrastructure for the euro, it is natural to study whether similar action might be useful or necessary today at the euro-area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I would like briefly to outline the Eurosystem's views in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The ECB's views on efficient infrastructure and the role of the public sector It is clear that in order to reap the benefits of the single currency in the financial markets, the securities industry needs a "domestic" infrastructure for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The Eurosystem takes the position that the infrastructure for the euro should be located in the euro area, as is the case for the core infrastructures of any monetary area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is naturally in central banks' interests to have the infrastructure for their currency located within their area of jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">This enables them to address regulatory concerns efficiently and means that they can address any liquidity problems that may be triggered by payment, clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">For these reasons, too, existing and possible future international agreements between central banks and securities regulators   give a prominent role to "home" authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I would like to add at this juncture that the existence of a domestic infrastructure does not preclude the emergence of "global" infrastructures, such as the Continuous Linked Settlement   Bank in the field of payment systems, or the International Central Securities Depositories in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Key concepts for the Eurosystem in this respect are legal feasibility and interoperability, which means agreeing upon common processes, methods, protocols and networks to enable co-operation between different infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">An interesting issue from the central bank's point of view is the degree of concentration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.82,0)">Network externalities and economies of scale suggest a high degree of concentration, possibly even a natural monopoly, but fully consolidated networks also present certain negative features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A high degree of consolidation implies that any failure of the network will have high systemic and contagion risks and costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In addition, in a monopoly situation, service providers do not necessarily have adequate incentives to innovate and enhance their product or service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.87,0)">This can be reflected in excessive prices for the users or unjustified barriers to entry for potential new providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">While the Eurosystem clearly supports the view expressed among others by the Lamfalussy Committee of Wise Men that the consolidation process should in general be driven by market forces, there are reasons why the public authorities in general and the Eurosystem in particular should be interested and involved in the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">First, efficient and safe securities clearing and settlement systems are a necessary condition for integrated capital markets, the sound execution of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of payment systems and the preservation of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Second, the complexity of the consolidation process and the different interests at stake requires fair conditions for competition and co­ordination between competitors, as well as co-operation between market participants and the public authorities and, possibly, policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The role of the public authorities is important in two main fields: removing obstacles to consolidation and ensuring an integrated regulatory and oversight framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">There is no need to repeat the activities recommended by the Committee of Wise Men or the Giovannini Group or the activities included in the Financial Services Action Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The ECB supports the work of the European Commission in this area and welcomes in particular the extension of the Investment Services Directive to include clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The Eurosystem's contribution to removing obstacles to consolidation mainly focuses on acting as a catalyst for improvement by encouraging discussions among the relevant players, and, last but not least, on harmonising central bank procedures and operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.96,0)">Because of the potential systemic implications, securities clearing and settlement systems are a critical financial market component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">That is why ensuring an integrated regulatory and oversight framework is of the utmost importance to the authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such issues fall under the competence of both central banks and securities or banking supervisors and thus need joint consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is essential that co-operation with all the relevant authorities establishes effective risk management standards for the clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securities regulators and central banks have already initiated a discussion of these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At G10 level, for example, the CPSS-IOSCO Joint Task Force has established standards for securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The fruitful experience gained here has encouraged similar work to be undertaken at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">For this purpose, the ESCB has established a framework for co-operation with the Committee of European Securities Regulators, primarily aimed at assessing how the G10 recommendations should be adopted and implemented throughout Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Conclusions and suggestions for further research I would like to conclude my overview by summarising four very closely inter­ linked areas where we at the ECB would like experts to focus their attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, even if the process of consolidation were to remain in the hands of the private sector in general, there can be circumstances under which policy decisions might be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is important for us to analyse under which circumstances, from an economic point of view, there is an argument for public involvement in the consolidation process itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, optimal organisation of the securities industry and in particular the optimum degree of concentration is an open and interesting question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">What kind of trade-off between scale effects and competition best guarantees efficient services, low costs to clients and safe systems from the point of view of financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Third, it is well worth examining the precise impact that the "insourcing" of the securities services by banks has for both the consolidation of the industry and the oversight, supervision and financial stability functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.34,0)">Fourth, it would be interesting to have an objective study of the preferences, expectations and needs of the various securities market players, as well as their complaints and frustrations with regard to the different practices and procedures of the ECB and the National Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.22,0)">Is there anything in the Eurosystem which is hampering the consolidation of euro area-wide domestic systems?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Last but not least, I am delighted to see the considerable interest that all the participants in this workshop show in financial market issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I am convinced that your input and co-operation will greatly promote the understanding of developments and problems in financial market integration, along with the understanding of the remedies needed.</span>
