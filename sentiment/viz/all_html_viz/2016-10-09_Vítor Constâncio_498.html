    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)"> Securing sustained economic growth in the euro area Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the G30 Meeting in Washington, 9 October 2016 Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me here today and for giving me the opportunity to be part of such a distinguished panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.41,0)">The subject matter of our panel is a demanding one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.65,0)">Nine years after the beginning of the crisis, advanced economies are apparently settled in a regime of low growth and low inflation with no end in sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In many places, a weary complacency seems to be reconciled with the “new normal long-term economic equilibrium”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.2,0)">However, in our democratic societies this is not a stable social equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.49,0)">It is not even a sustainable long-term economic equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Our economies need a higher level of nominal growth to work properly: to absorb overhangs from the crisis, to spur investment and productivity, to generate enough return for the pensions of an ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.89,0)">The OECD referred to the present situation as a “self-reinforcing low growth trap” and the IMF”s Maurice Obstfeld stated “Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself – through the negative economic and political forces it is unleashing.”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The self-perpetuating nature of the present dynamics, underlined by both institutions, has to be broken by new significant policy initiatives that can lift confidence and “animal spirits” in our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Following the initial broad-based policy reaction, monetary policy has done most of the expansionary effort to support the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Yet, securing sustained economic growth and employment cannot be dependent on monetary policy alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">At the national and European levels, a much more comprehensive policy response is needed, especially now that markets have started to show scepticism about what monetary policy can continue to do going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This underpins the urgency of both a meaningful implementation of targeted structural reforms and the adoption of growth friendly fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Prospects for the euro area economy Turning to recent euro area developments, the recovery is continuing its moderate but steady pace, supported mainly by the ECB’s expansionary policies, which have significantly improved financial conditions, reduced financial fragmentation and supported economic activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">In the absence of our measures, both growth and inflation in the euro area would have been significantly worse, as our models calculate that inflation and growth would be lower by 0.8 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, than the forecast values of 0.2% and 1.7% for this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.88,0)">For three years now, inflation has been quite low with a level of 0.4% in 2014, 0% last year and 0.2% forecast for this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">However, the recent flash estimate for September at 0.4% may indicate a movement compatible with our baseline scenario that foresees a gradual increase to levels above 1% by next spring, if no major downward movement in commodity prices takes place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Additionally, the normalisation of inflation depends on the continued closing of the negative output gap and more dynamic wage behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In the first half of 2016 the euro area grew at an annualised rate of 1.7%, similar to last year’s growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This figure is far from being impressive, especially considering that the euro area is in the early phase of a recovery after the second recession in 2012 and 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">On the other hand, the unemployment rate, albeit falling, still remains above 10% amid a continuous increase in the participation rate in the labour force since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.91,0)">One positive aspect is that our policies have contributed to a decrease in financial fragmentation and that the dispersion of GDP growth and inflation across euro area countries is at the lowest level since the beginning of monetary union in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Another positive note is that the recent growth was largely driven by domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Moreover, the recovery has proved resilient to a series of adverse shocks over the past year: the slowdown in China last summer, the acute stock market turbulence in the early part of this year and, most recently, the uncertainty created by the UK referendum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">At the same time, this resilience reflects to a large degree the amount of monetary expansion – actual and expected – that is embedded in financial prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, with the five packages of measures we have adopted since June 2014, we have reduced the cost of capital, produced rebalancing effects in other asset markets, improved credit supply conditions and restored credit volume growth since the latter part of 2014, after two years of negative developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Figure 1: Yields on bank and non-financial bonds have eased by 90 and 100 basis points, respectively, in response to the measures taken, testifying to the effectiveness of the current policy package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Funding conditions for banks improved as wholesale money market rates became negative and as banks received direct support from new liquidity facilities with four-year maturities and low rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These developments have stimulated the pass-through of this funding cost relief to borrowing costs for both firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.02,0)">As a consequence, bank lending rates to non-financial corporations   and households are now at historical lows, and there has been a significant reduction in the fragmentation of lending rates across euro area countries as well as for large and small loans  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It is also important to note that the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism   in November 2014 helped put the banking sector in a stronger position to transmit our monetary impulses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Figure 2: Figure 3: The capital position of euro area significant banks has been improving from a common equity capital ratio   of 7% in 2008 and 9% in 2012, and now stands 14.4%, with a total capital ratio of 18%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">The problem for European banks lies, however, in the present low profitability levels resulting from legacy non-performing loans, excess banking capacity, growing competition from non-banks and slow adjustment to new business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.17,0)">Return on equity in the first half of 2016 was just 5.8%, against 5.5% for the whole of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.84,0)">The low profitability has driven a poor performance of stock prices, leading to quite low price-to-book ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Contrary to some perceptions, our monetary policy has had a positive effect on the profitability of banks since 2014, by reducing their funding costs, by ensuring capital gains related to higher prices of financial assets affected by QE, by reducing impairment costs and by increasing credit volumes as a result of a strengthening recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">We are aware that some of these effects will wane with time and that the banking sector will have to undergo structural reforms to overcome the challenges of a low profitability environment that, looking forward, is not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Public policy initiatives are necessary to foster the restructuring efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In spite of the present headwinds, banks have resumed credit expansion since late 2014 to a present growth rate of 1.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This improvement is also evident from the latest bank lending surveys  , which reveal a continued easing of credit supply standards on loans to firms which is largely driven by increasing competition among banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.96,0)">This increased competition has been one of the main mechanisms through which our measures – notably TLTROs – have been operating and has squeezed bank margins, causing bank lending rates to fall and, consequently, net demand for borrowing to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As banks begin attracting additional borrowers, this leads to a gradual easing of credit standards and an additional strengthening of competitive pressures which lower lending rates and increase loan demand further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This in turn supports macroeconomic conditions and reduces non-performing loans, thereby validating ex post the lower lending rate and creating a positive feedback loop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In effect, our credit easing measures have stimulated banks to start competing again for good credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">This evidence is supported by the findings of model-based analysis carried out by ECB staff, which suggests that credit supply restrictions are no longer dampening loan growth to NFCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Furthermore, according to the ECB survey on the access to finance of enterprises  , credit conditions are also improving for euro area small and medium-sized enterprises  , which constitute the backbone of the euro area economy and represent the vast majority of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Staff economic projections Overall, the impact of our measures has been significant, but the euro area recovery has certainly not been as fast as we had hoped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.06,0)">This is in part due to the headwinds stemming from the global economy, the structural slowdown in world trade and the financial crisis legacies lingering in many euro area countries which continue to dampen economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.91,0)">These factors explain why the risks to the outlook remain to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Nevertheless, the narrative of a continued yet moderate recovery is largely echoed in the latest   ECB staff macroeconomic projections for euro area activity, which are almost unchanged compared to June 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Real GDP is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.7% in 2016, 1.6% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Since the projections cut-off date, the flow of high frequency data has been consistent with the materialisation of this baseline scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Crucially, this projection is predicated on the current supportive financial conditions persisting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In fact, it is estimated that, cumulatively, the impact of our measures will contribute more than one and a half percentage points to real GDP growth between 2015 and 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Regarding inflation, the latest ECB staff projections foresee a rise to 1.2% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The contribution of our measures to this projected increase in inflation, is significant, representing, on average, an impact on the inflation rate of about half a percentage point each year between 2016 and 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In sum, the recovery has shown resilience in the face of a sequence of adverse shocks affecting the economy, although inflation dynamics have remained weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.85,0)">In addition, the envisaged return of inflation over the next couple of years to levels more consistent with our aim of below but close to 2% is very much dependent on the full implementation of our policy package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Last March we took a powerful set of measures by increasing our asset purchase programme and extending it to corporate bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">We also introduced a new medium-term liquidity facility with interest rates that can go as low as our negative deposit facility rate, contingent on the banks reaching a credit growth benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">As the ECB Governing Council has committed itself to pursuing the present set of policies, particularly the QE component, until we attain “a sustained path towards our inflation objective” and “at least until March 2017”, we will have to decide closer to that date the final timeline of the programme and its conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We have not yet started any discussion about this issue, but we have become aware that market developments have raised increasing implementation challenges for asset purchases in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">On account of this, in September the Governing Council tasked the relevant Eurosystem committees to evaluate the options that will ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme until March 2017, or beyond, if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.07,0)">The committees will report back to the Governing Council by December 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">It should be noted that the parameters of the programme can be adjusted at any time to achieve the intended amount of purchases, and it should be stressed that the Governing Council will continue to implement an accommodative monetary policy to fulfil its price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Other policies Monetary policy is effective in correcting cyclical fluctuations, but it also contributes to medium-term growth by increasing capacity-building investment and by accelerating the closing of the output gap, thereby avoiding hysteresis effects in the labour market and in the capital stock that are detrimental to potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is indisputable that long-term economic growth is mostly determined by supply-side factors such as productivity, technological innovation, the business environment and the quality of public institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In all euro area countries there is room for improvement in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This requires governments to continue to implement a comprehensive and focused suite of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Fiscal policy also needs to play a larger role in supporting the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Fiscal expansion can contribute to increased interest rates by expanding the supply of safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Conceptually, in terms of overlapping generations models with small Ricardian effects, this would also push upwards the real equilibrium interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">While many euro area countries have very limited fiscal room for manoeuvre, those that have some should use it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">All countries, however, should look at ways to enhance the composition of their fiscal policies with a view to making it more growth-friendly, particularly in the area of taxation and the share of public investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Only with the right combination of structural and fiscal policies is it possible to fully reap the benefits of our accommodative monetary policy and increase the euro area’s potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the European level, firms and households need more clarity over the future institutional set-up of the euro area, which is incomplete in key areas, such as banking union and capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.77,0)">This uncertainty is detrimental to investment, increases the precautionary saving of households and undermines our monetary policy effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">As I mentioned at the beginning, we need governments to activate an assertive three-pronged strategy of growth initiatives that can break the self-reinforcing mechanisms mentioned by the OECD and the IMF that seem to be condemning the advanced economies to a mediocre regime of socially unsustainable low nominal growth.</span>
