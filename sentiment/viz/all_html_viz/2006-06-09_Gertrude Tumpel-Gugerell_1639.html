    <span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)"> Drivers for change in payment and securities settlement systems Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat a conference “Central Banks in the 21st Century” organised by the Banco de EspañaMadrid, 8-9 June 2006 Introduction It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to be here and to celebrate with you the 150th anniversary of the adoption of the name “Banco de España” by the Spanish central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">I am very grateful for the opportunity to comment on issues relating to payment and securities settlement systems, which I regard as vital for the central banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">I am also delighted to have three distinguished speakers participating in this session: Mr Giovannini, who will discuss the challenges of integration in the European securities settlement systems, Mr Noyer, who will comment on European payment systems, and Mr Santomero, who will provide us with a US perspective on the changing pattern of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will introduce this session with some remarks on the drivers of current and future institutional developments in payment and securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Enhancing economic productivity depends to a considerable extent on the efficiency of the payment and securities settlement market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.6,0)">In fact, it has been argued that a significant part of the backlog of productivity growth in Europe vis-à-vis the United States results from inefficiencies in banking and securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">I believe that progress has been made to eliminate these inefficiencies, but more work needs to be done by the financial industry, regulators and politicians to speed up the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Payments The payments business accounts for a considerable share of costs and revenues in the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In Europe, it generates about a third of the costs and a quarter of the revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, the contribution of payments to banking profit is relatively modest at 9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.62,0)">Even this profitability level is further threatened by societal and regulatory pressure on fees and margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">To meet these challenges, I would like to discuss three areas of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">1) Integration of the large-value and retail payments market In my discussion of the integration of the payments market, I will focus primarily on Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The United States is more advanced in this respect as the integration process has already taken place there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For large-value payments, the creation of TARGET2 will conclude the consolidation process of RTGS systems in the euro area that was initiated with TARGET1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">TARGET2 will provide the potential for further efficiency gains and cost reductions to its users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Additionally, it will incorporate features that allow for more flexibility in the risk-cost trade-off, for example liquidity saving features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">What does this mean in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In my view the launch of TARGET2 will create the possibility for pan-European banks to centralise their payments back offices and liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Economies of scale and scope will lead to sizeable cost reductions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">TARGET2 is not the only driver for integration, consolidation and consequently for potential efficiency gains for banks and society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The creation of the Single Euro Payments Area   will act as a great boost for Europe’s single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For retail payments, the creation of the SEPA is the topic driving the integration of the payments market in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The Eurosystem has allocated considerable resources to support this process, encourage banks to work towards the SEPA goals and involve all stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The SEPA project is far-reaching and involves the creation of standardised pan- European payment schemes, such as credit transfer and direct debit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In addition, it includes a framework for the pan-European use of cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">From 1 January 2008, the SEPA will promote choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Choice for corporations, merchants and consumers: thanks to SEPA, corporations, merchants and consumers will no longer be bound to their “national” commercial banks or card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Furthermore, merchants will be able to choose to accept debit card schemes in their shops other than the current national ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Choice for the commercial banks: banks can choose to enter new geographical markets by offering their payment services to potential new clients in other European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The SEPA also offers banks a choice as far as the way in which they can process their payments is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Owing to standardisation, infrastructures will become fully inter-operable within the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Consequently, geographical location will no longer be an issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.09,0)">Moreover, I expect that the number of automated clearing houses in the euro area will fall considerably in the coming years, a prediction which has also been publicly acknowledged by them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Ultimately, I anticipate that the SEPA will create a competitive pan-European payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The SEPA will enable banks and infrastructures to reduce their costs and exploit economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In the end, the SEPA will allow the end-user to benefit from these efficiency gains through a combination of better products, better services, and better prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">TARGET2 and the SEPA will therefore transform the payments market in the euro area, making it more dynamic and cost efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">2) Technological innovation will be one of the additional effects of these dynamics Exploiting technological innovation can be an important means of saving costs, which is a pressing need in the payments business in order to further avoid eroding profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.42,0)">For instance, if customers move away from paper to electronic payments, the consequent use of straight-through processing would become a reality, even for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Considerable cost savings would become possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In order to fully exploit the technological possibilities, standardisation is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.82,0)">If the market cannot agree on standardisation, regulatory steps may be necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">3) Enlarging the market for payment services An additional effect of the dynamics in the market for payment services will be the enlarging of the market, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">by promoting cashless payments and offering value-added services to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This will lead to cost-savings, but will also generate further revenue sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Although it falls to the banks to develop their business proposals, central banks can assist by offering their expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Securities Moving on from payments to securities settlement issues, the issues at stake are hardly less challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The need for action at European Union   level to improve clearing and settlement processes in the EU has been highlighted recently in two communications by the European Commission on financial markets and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.52,0)">The current cross-border arrangements in the EU are complex and fragmented and impose excessive costs, risks and inefficiencies on investors, institutions and issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The documents published by the Commission show the variations in cost structure among different EU markets and how a more   efficient post-trading infrastructure could lead to a reduction in transaction costs of up to 18%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This, in turn, could increase GDP by around 0.6% in subsequent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This confirms that we need an integrated infrastructure, but it is easier said than done!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">How can we achieve this in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I would like to stimulate reflection on three main aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">1) Integration is a slow but continuous process First, Rome was not built in a day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Nor was, for instance, the integrated securities infrastructure in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It may be worth recalling that the process of integration in the United States started in 1975 and was completed in 1999 with the creation of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The process of integration took just under 25 years in a country with a single currency, a single central bank, a single regulator, a single legal framework, and last, but not necessarily least, a single language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the European Union, we have 13 currencies, 13 central banks, more than 50 regulators, 25 legal systems and about 20 languages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In the euro area things are a little better, since we at least have a single currency and a single system of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">It is clear that we cannot expect a rapid solution, but it is important to have a clear vision of what we would like to achieve or at least of what we do not want to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The process of integration is already underway: it started six years ago following the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Since then, some progress has been made moving on from a situation in which cross-border securities settlement was just “possible” towards a truly European domestic infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">One example is the increase in the use of cross-border collateral for Eurosystem credit operations from 16% in 2001 to 45% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.89,0)">Progress has also been made on the consolidation of central counterparties   and central securities depositaries  : the number of CCPs fell from 14 in 1999 to 7 in 2005, while the number of CSDs fell from 22 to 19 over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In some cases, consolidation is leading to lower transactions fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For instance, this has been the case for Euronext, and is foreseen to be the case for the Nordic CSDs alliance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.1,0)">Nevertheless, the market is still fragmented, further integration is required, and Rome is still a long way off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">2) There is no single recipe for integration Second, all roads lead to Rome, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">there is not necessarily an optimal recipe/model for achieving integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The US model   is not necessarily the benchmark for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The different starting point may justify a different path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Now, necessity is the mother of invention and, here, the invention is called “interoperability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What interoperability actually means in practical terms in the field of post-trading infrastructure remains to be defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">One peculiar aspect of the European infrastructure seems to be that interoperability encompasses the concept of vertical and horizontal integration and can only be achieved as a joint effort by all of the interested players: not only stock exchanges, central counterparties, central securities depositories, but also central banks, as providers of payment and collateral management services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Cooperation is helpful because many hands make light work, but is also necessary because a chain is no stronger than its weakest link.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">3) The role of authorities Third, there is no doubt that the process of integration should be market-driven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.08,0)">However, this does not mean that authorities should just stand back and wait and see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.15,0)">Action by authorities is warranted in the event of market failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.56,0)">Some markets can be reluctant to change   and the different time horizon of costs   and revenues   relating to the necessary investments may increase this reluctance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.7,0)">Moreover, market forces may not be able to take all the necessary steps to ensure effective competition as well as the stability of the infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">It is not a coincidence that, to date, the most successful example of integrated infrastructure has been the establishment of the TARGET system for settlement of large-value payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It should be noted that TARGET was created not by the market, but by the central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Moreover, action is required to remove legal and fiscal barriers to integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">In this respect, the Eurosystem welcomes the initiatives specified in the Communication by the European Commission and, in particular, supports the adoption of a framework directive on clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A directive could complement the market-led removal of barriers to integration and contribute to ensuring fair and open access and price transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This is, in turn, a necessary condition to ensure effective competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.44,0)">The Eurosystem also deems it important that the EU securities infrastructure is adequately protected from financial and operational risks and that no regulatory arbitrage is introduced by the adoption of inconsistent or diverging regulatory standards in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The Eurosystem therefore takes the view that the finalisation and implementation of the ESCB-CESR standards for clearing and settlement are essential to ensure the sound and smooth functioning of the EU financial infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Conclusion I hope I have succeeded in touching on the main drivers of change in payment and securities settlement systems and I am now looking forward to the presentations of the three panellists who will provide more detail on these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">As none of them needs to be really introduced to you, let me just say that I am very proud to chair such a distinguished panel: Alberto Giovannini fights at a day-to-day basis for a comprehensive programme of fostering integration in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.42,0)">It is a bit unfair to him that we speak about “Giovannini barriers” as if he had some responsibility himself for the persistence of these obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Instead, we should speak about the “Giovannini vision” that his report so convincingly put forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Christian Noyer is in the driving seat of building a dynamic and competitive European economy and represents an important financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">With his leadership and clear-sightedness, he helps the industry to seize the large opportunities that an integrated Europe offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Anthony M. Santomero combines an in impressive manner the world of academia and central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The US financial sector provides to some extent a blue print for an integrated financial sector in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Therefore, it is particularly interesting to listen to the assessment by someone that has himself helped so much – through practical as well as well academic contributions – to shape the financial sector.</span>
