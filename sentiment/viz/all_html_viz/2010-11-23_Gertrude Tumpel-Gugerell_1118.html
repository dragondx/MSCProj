    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> The euro area's economic outlook Intervention by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, during a panel discussion on Europe’s financial forecast at the Bloomberg Businessweek European Leadership Forum, London, 23 November 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to attend this year’s Bloomberg Businessweek European Leadership Forum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Bloomberg’s and Europe’s economy have at least one thing in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Coincidently, Bloomberg was founded in 1981 and so was the ECU, the European currency unit, one of the forefathers of our common currency, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">So let me take the opportunity, today, to speak about the state of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">When assessing the euro area economic outlook, three criteria are of particular relevance in the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, how much does the euro area banking sector still rely on central bank liquidity support measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And second, can we be confident that private sector domestic demand can contribute to a sustained economic recovery?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.72,0)">And third, what are the implications for price stability against this background?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In what I will present to you I will argue that there are some good news when assessing these two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">First, money market activity in the euro area improved which has allowed the ECB to withdraw some of the liquidity support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Second, household incomes and non-financial corporations’ balance sheets are improving supporting a positive outlook on euro area growth, also against the background of further consolidation efforts of euro area governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And third, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households, also as inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">So let me assess the euro area financial and economic outlook in a bit more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.39,0)">Part I: Assessing the euro area financial and economic outlook Reduction of central bank intermediation… The size of refinancing operations has decreased considerably since 30 June 2010, from €881 billion on that date to €510 billion in mid-November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.36,0)">The phasing-out of non-standard measures continued in the third quarter of 2010, and is still continuing in the fourth quarter, as all maturing one-year and six-month longer-term refinancing operations   are not being renewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">… as money markets are improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Conditions in the euro area money markets are improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The volumes in the interbank money market   have virtually doubled since summer, and are now back to the levels prevailing before August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The overall reduction in central bank liquidity has brought the interbank   rate closer to the policy rate, which is an important step towards going back to our pre-crisis framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Euro area activity recovered in the second quarter of 2010… Economic activity in the euro area is recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, GDP grew by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2010, after increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">While no breakdown is available for the third quarter of 2010, all components contributed positively to quarterly GDP growth in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In particular, domestic demand contributed quite strongly for the first time since the crisis, namely by 0.5 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">… and surveys point to ongoing growth into the fourth quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Looking beyond the third quarter, survey indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers’ index   and European Commission business surveys for the manufacturing and the services sectors, point to ongoing growth in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Consumer confidence increased in October and stood above its long-term average, pointing to a gradual recovery in euro area consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Good prospects for households’ income from the stabilisation in the labour markets… The sentiment in the survey data finds its support in a number of encouraging developments, both in the household and in the non-financial corporations sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">On the household side, labour markets are stabilising, with employment levels remaining stable in the first and the second quarters of 2010, while hours worked increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in both these quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.81,0)">The effect of the crisis on hours worked was far stronger than that on the number of persons employed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.59,0)">Therefore, the upturn has also been stronger in terms of the hours worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.58,0)">Moreover, the unemployment rate has stabilised in the last few months and stood at 10.0% in the third quarter of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Overall, the stabilisation in the labour markets is creating good prospects for household income and, thereby, also for private consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.25,0)">Indeed, the breakdown of households’ income shows that the share of compensation of employees has increased recently, while the contribution of net social benefits has declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">… and upward trend in production and new orders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As to non-financial corporations, we can observe an increasing improvement in their conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Industrial production   and new orders   are on a rising trend after the strong decline observed during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Financing conditions are showing signs of improvement… Euro area financing conditions are showing signs of a gradual improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.39,0)">Short term and long term bank lending rates are currently at very low levels by historical standards supporting a turnaround in the demand for credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">… supporting the turnaround in the growth of lending to households and non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The annual growth of MFI loans to non-financial corporations became less negative in September, confirming that the turnaround in loan dynamics is ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations is actually expected to turn positive in the last quarter of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.28,0)">Part II: Challenges ahead The crisis has brought to the fore a number challenges for the euro area economy and our common currency, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some of these challenges are new ones, but some are existing ones that were amplified by the crisis developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is clear that we cannot be complacent against the background of the positive sentiment on the euro area economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We need to ambitiously and urgently address the challenges that we are facing to ensure a continued and sustainable outlook for euro area growth and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">For this reason we need bold reforms in Europe’s economic governance, particularly with regard to fiscal and macroeconomic policy surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.85,0)">Consolidation of public finances… The crisis has caused public finances to deteriorate significantly, not only in the euro area, but throughout the advanced world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This can be seen, first and foremost, from the rapid rise in government deficits and debt ratios over a short period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The budget gaps in the United Kingdom and the United States have actually reached double-digit figures, with Japan coming close as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">As regards the euro area, according to the Spring 2010 projections by the European Commission, the government deficit could rise to 6.6% of GDP this year, before moderating to 6.1% in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">… and its underlying factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These budgetary developments reflect three main factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first, is the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">the reaction to the recession built into the budgets, given the existing social security and tax systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Second, the origins of the fiscal expansion are to be found in the stimulus packages that were a coordinated response to the European Economic Recovery Plan of December 2008 and bank recapitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.53,0)">Their cumulative impact was roughly 2.3% of GDP in 2009-10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.74,0)">Third, a number of other factors show up in an expansionary fiscal stance, namely other discretionary measures, unexpected revenue shortfalls   and ongoing spending trends  , even as the trend of nominal GDP growth fell markedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">However, against the background of rapidly deteriorating fiscal positions, many euro area countries have started to implement their consolidation plans, which is reflected in the projected decrease in fiscal deficits for the coming year by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Diverse developments in unit labour costs across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the years prior to the crisis, the development of competitiveness diverged significantly across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Relative price adjustments have thus far been relatively moderate within the euro area, if there have been any at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.61,0)">In fact, unit labour costs in the period 2008-09 have generally increased in deficit countries relative to those in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Looking forward, such cost adjustment in the period 2010-11 is currently expected to be relatively limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">According to European Commission forecasts, only Ireland is expected to experience a significant improvement in its labour costs relative to those in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.13,0)">While the growth of labour costs is also expected to decline in all other deficit countries, it will in many cases remain close to, or even above, the corresponding rate for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Therefore including competitiveness as an indicator for surveillance at the European level is key and already foreseen in the new EU economic governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Reform of the EU’s economic governance framework… European leaders recognize the need of a considerable strengthening of the economic model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">At their meeting on 28 and 29 October 2010, the EU Heads of State and Government agreed on the reform of the European Union’s economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The proposals put forward by President van Rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, the Governing Council feels that they do not go far enough to be the quantum leap forward in the economic governance of Monetary Union that it has been calling for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">On the fiscal surveillance, we need an effective surveillance mechanism so that corrective policy action is taken in good time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And we need ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% of GDP ceiling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">On the broader surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the euro area, we need a new system of mutual surveillance in the euro area, concentrating firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits as these countries face the greatest sustainability challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms and specify clearly the sanctions in case of breach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And we need full transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action should be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">… with a special focus on financial surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.75,0)">And finally, the financial crisis has taught us that economic growth can be severely impacted by financial market disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">For this reason, European leaders agreed on a new financial supervisory architecture for the EU aiming to prevent financial disruptions of the kind that we have been experiencing in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This new financial supervisory architecture, which will become operational as of 1 January 2011, includes the three new European Supervisory Authorities   for banking, insurance and securities markets to enhance micro-prudential supervision and the European Systemic Risk Board   as the new macro-prudential supervisory body in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB will provide the secretariat to the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The assignment to the ECB of specific tasks concerning the functioning of the ESRB is welcome, but does not constitute a change in the mandate or an additional objective for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Rather, these tasks should contribute to financial stability, while being fully in line with the ECB’s primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There are clear lines of institutional separation between the ECB and the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In particular, both institutions are independent and have separate, clearly defined mandates, namely the maintenance of price stability in the case of the ECB and the mitigation of systemic risk in that of the ESRB.</span>
