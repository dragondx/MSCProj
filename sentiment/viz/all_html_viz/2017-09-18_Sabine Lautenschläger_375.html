    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.63,0)"> Regulation, supervision and market discipline – striking a balance Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at a conference hosted by the Financial Stability Institute, 18 September 2017, Basel Almost nine years ago to the day, the investment bank Lehman Brothers failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.89,0)">What followed was a financial crisis that wreaked havoc on economies around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But it did more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.33,0)">The crisis also shattered many beliefs about how the banking system works and how it should be regulated and supervised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">There was a time when many people believed that the market could bring about a stable and efficient banking sector on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">They thought that market forces would ensure banks had sustainable business models that were resilient to the ups and downs of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.97,0)">We now know that this did not turn out so well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In fact, there are three pillars that support a stable banking sector: regulation, supervision and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.65,0)">The crisis made clear that all of these pillars were in need of some repairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The good news is that we have come a long way – today, the banking sector rests on more solid foundations than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But some issues still need to be resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let us briefly look over them, beginning with regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.74,0)">Once the crisis had started, everyone agreed that the rulebook needed to be rewritten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And back then, everyone agreed that the revised rulebook needed to be a global one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The crisis clearly demonstrated that banking is a global business, so the rules that govern it should also be global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">Today, however, it is much less clear whether everyone still subscribes to the idea of a global rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.72,0)">And this worries me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.61,0)">It worries me because it shows that people are starting to forget the lessons we learned from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">That’s why we need to finalise the global rulebook, Basel III, as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But that is just the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The second step is to implement and apply the rules in a broadly consistent manner at regional and national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.54,0)">And this is a challenge – sometimes we see quite a different interpretation of the standards when it comes to implementing and applying them at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">You won’t be surprised that I will focus on the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The euro area countries have become closely intertwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For many years now they have shared a single market and a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Since the crisis, they have even begun to build a banking union, which includes a single supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But when it comes to regulation, we still see differences between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is true, of course, that we have a single rulebook in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">As one might expect for a union, we had to come further than other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, parts of that rulebook come in the form of EU directives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">And these still need to be transposed into national law, which explains some of the differences we see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.15,0)">So regulation in the euro area remains fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">But this runs counter to the idea of “same business, same risk, same rules”; and it runs counter to the idea of the European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">So there is a clear case to be made for further harmonising the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We need a well-written rulebook to keep risks in the banking sector in check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But rules are just one of the pillars that support a stable banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second pillar is supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And here we need to strike a delicate balance because these two pillars interact in a subtle way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The general idea is that rules create the foundations for supervisors to do their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.89,0)">There is a danger, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.58,0)">If the rulebook becomes too detailed, it might wall supervisors in and limit their options too much, rather than provide them with solid foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And this can happen fairly quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.57,0)">By way of example, just think of speed limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let’s say you want to set a speed limit for motorways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Does 120 kilometres per hour sound about right?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At first sight, this is a very simple and straightforward rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.93,0)">But then you start to think – what if there’s a sharp and dangerous bend in the road?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Wouldn’t that call for a lower speed limit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.41,0)">And what if the road becomes slippery when it rains?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.44,0)">Perhaps the speed limit should depend on the weather?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">And shouldn’t it also depend on the kind of vehicle?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">One could easily think of many more questions like these.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.73,0)">So even a seemingly simple rule can quickly start to become more and more complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.35,0)">The world is complex and uncertain, particularly when it comes to finance and banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That leaves us with two options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Either we come up with more rules to try to cover every potential situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Or we allow supervisors some discretion within a set framework and let them judge specific situations on their merits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the end, these two options need to be in balance, and we must be careful not to disturb this balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And here is where I see some cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.44,0)">Regulators might be tempted to lay down rules to cover every eventuality – think of the example I just gave you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">And their motivation would certainly be laudable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.71,0)">But their goal would be unattainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.46,0)">It is just not possible to cater for every potential situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.63,0)">There are too many possibilities, most of which we cannot anticipate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.36,0)">No one knows what financial innovations might emerge; no one knows where technological change will lead us; and no one knows how the economy will evolve over the coming decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.43,0)">If we try to cover everything, the rulebook will, at some point, become too detailed, too big and too complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">From that point onwards it will stop making the banking sector a safer place and instead create new problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.01,0)">First, overly complex rules facilitate regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Yes, we could add page after page to the rulebook, setting out detailed rules, definitions and thresholds governing how banks should deal with risks and specifying, for instance, which tools supervisors should use in certain situations, and when.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.55,0)">But with each new page, more loopholes open up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">It becomes easier for banks to game the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.09,0)">This defeats the purpose of a rulebook and poses a threat to stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.59,0)">Second, there is the problem of interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.42,0)">The more rules there are, the more they can interact and interfere with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.39,0)">If there are two rules, there is just one way in which they can interact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If there are 1,000 rules, they can, in theory, interact in at least 500,000 ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.89,0)">It becomes ever more difficult to foresee the overall effect of the rules, and the danger of unintended side-effects increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.82,0)">And third, there is the issue of costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.56,0)">The thicker the rulebook, the more expensive it becomes for banks to comply with it and for supervisors to do their jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">These costs are justifiable if each additional rule reduces the risk of another crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">However, at a certain point the costs of the rules begin to outweigh the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">So, instead of having overly detailed rules, we should have a strong basic set of rules that allows supervisors some discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">.Supervisors have the relevant skills and experience, and in-depth knowledge of the banks they supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">We should ensure that supervisors can continue to apply their judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They should be empowered to assess the risks that a bank poses to its stakeholders and the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This will enable them to deal with risks at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.08,0)">But if the rulebook becomes too extensive and too detailed, supervision turns into a simple box-ticking exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.85,0)">A large, detailed and seemingly comprehensive set of rules would make supervisors less flexible and effective; it would leave no room for discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.6,0)">Supervisors would no longer be able to react quickly to newly emerging risks in an ever-changing banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.05,0)">They would be walled in by rules that were devised to cover every possible situation but, in reality, were outdated right from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So, looking ahead, we must fight the urge to make the rulebook ever more detailed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.77,0)">But don’t get me wrong – we shouldn’t unwind any of the reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What has been done was necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">But we should be cautious about going too far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A few clear principles can be more effective than 1,000 complex rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The two pillars of regulation and supervision are equally important and we should not favour one at the other’s expense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And this brings us to the third pillar of a stable banking sector: market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With all this talk about rules and supervision, we must not forget that banks operate in a market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So why not use market forces to keep risks in check?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.66,0)">There is nothing like the prospect of failure and financial loss to keep a lid on risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">And this, as a general rule, is the essence of market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.47,0)">Investors who stand to lose their own money will be more cautious than investors who can offload losses onto someone else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.17,0)">But, as I said earlier, markets have not always exerted discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.55,0)">During the crisis, bank failures were rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.56,0)">But why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.48,0)">Well, first, there was a lack of tools to resolve failing banks – particularly across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.47,0)">And second, there were fears of contagion and a meltdown of the entire financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.01,0)">So, in the end, governments often stepped in and propped up failing banks with public funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.59,0)">There was no chance for the market to impose discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.35,0)">This has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In Europe, we now have a single resolution mechanism for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">It was designed to ensure that banks can fail in an orderly manner without damaging the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This new mechanism has recently passed its first series of tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Generally speaking, it was successful, although some adjustments are still needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In any case, we have taken a big step towards more market discipline in the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">To sum up, a stable banking sector is supported by three pillars: regulation, supervision and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Since the crisis, we have made these three pillars stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Now we have to make sure that they remain in good shape and share the load in a balanced way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Otherwise, we will not reap all the benefits of the transformation that has taken place in banking supervision.</span>
