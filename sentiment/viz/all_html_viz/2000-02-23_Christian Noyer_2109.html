    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> The short past and the long future of the euro Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of a conference organised by "le Club des Affaires de Berlin e.V.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">", in Berlin, 23 February 2000 It is a pleasure and an honour for me to speak here at the Club des Affaires de Berlin today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Since the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany more than 50 years ago, Berlin has attracted prominent speakers from all over the world praising this city as a symbol for the achievements of Western-type market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">With the fall of the Berlin wall and the introduction of the euro, integration in Europe has gained a new quality both from an economic and a political perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">German unification has raised expectations of a wider unification in Europe in the sense of further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">As Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission recently declared before the European Parliament: "The opened Brandenburg Gate stands as a powerful symbol of our continent's future".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The birth of the euro as the single currency for eleven Member States of the EU was an important step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Although this was only one year ago, the euro can be seen as a symbol for European achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The single currency offers a great opportunity to achieve and maintain price stability in Europe and to create the conditions needed for sustained economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">For the euro to become a "success story" as the single currency for around 300 million people, the confidence of the population in the stability of the new currency and in the single monetary policy of the Eurosystem plays a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The establishment of a "stability culture" throughout the euro area will contribute to the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The foundations of this stability culture are to be found in a broad consensus among Europeans that the maintenance of price stability is of utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">A stability culture also facilitates the achievement of other objectives, such as high employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The introduction of the euro marked the culmination of a long period of successful preparatory work, the magnitude of which can hardly be overestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">As a result of these efforts, the introduction of the euro took place in an environment of price stability that only a few observers would have predicted some years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In its short history, the Eurosystem has started to build up credibility and to gain a sound reputation in financial markets for its stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In the course of 1999, inflation for the euro area remained at a rate consistent with price stability of around 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The Eurosystem is determined to conduct the appropriate policy in order to ensure that price stability remains in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Let me also mention that, as expected, the transition of the euro area financial markets to the year 2000 went smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">This reflects the careful preparation of the banking and financial community and the comprehensive and flexible operational framework of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The establishment of Monetary Union marks an outstanding historical achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In my remarks I should like to summarise the main features of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy and the experience gained with the euro in this first year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">By subsequently addressing forthcoming challenges, I should then like to span the bridge towards the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A clear and transparent monetary policy strategy Let me describe our first experience with the monetary policy strategy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The Eurosystem has chosen a clear and transparent monetary policy strategy with a quantitative definition of its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The chosen stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is forward-looking and medium-term oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The Eurosystem has a policy framework which truly reflects the complexity of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">It is sufficiently flexible to allow for appropriate responses to specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">It also allows account to be taken of the possibility of regime shifts that could impact on the stability of important economic relationships in the course of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me briefly recall the main elements of the Eurosystem's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">A clear definition for the primary objective to maintain price stability in the euro area contributes to stabilising market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Price stability is defined as an annual increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The Eurosystem aims to maintain price stability in line with this definition over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In order to achieve its overriding objective, the Governing Council has adopted a two-pillar approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">By announcing a reference value for the growth rate of a broad monetary aggregate, the strategy takes into account that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The reference value exploits the leading indicator properties of the broad aggregate M3, which according to most empirical studies is the most useful guidepost for future price developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The first reference value was set in late 1998 at an annual growth rate for M3 of 4Â½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.84,0)">Following a review of the reference value in December 1999, the Governing Council decided to leave the reference value unchanged on the grounds that the underlying assumptions are still valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.82,0)">Under normal circumstances, significant and sustained deviations of actual monetary developments from this value would signal future risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.55,0)">However, the reference value is not an annual target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Rather, it is based on medium-term assumptions and serves as a guide for developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB is not committed to ensuring that M3 grows in line with the reference value at a particular point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This assessment encompasses a wide range of financial market and other economic indicators, including forecasts produced both within and outside the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Within the second pillar, cyclical developments and wages are important indicators for future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In addition, the exchange rate is one of the important determinants of the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">If exchange rate developments pose a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be taken into account together with the information on price developments revealed by all other indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.09,0)">Monetary policy does not react mechanically to developments in a single indicator or forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Instead, based on the signals provided by both pillars of the strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB sets the monetary policy instruments of the Eurosystem at the level which best serves the achievement of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.39,0)">Watchers of the ECB have criticised our communication policy for a lack of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.48,0)">Central banks are used to this kind of criticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.86,0)">More recently this criticism has also been extended to other central banks which follow a strategy of   inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, we should be clear that revealing every aspect of an ongoing discussion is not an objective in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Instead, communication should be an element that reinforces the efficiency of monetary policy by making it comprehensible and facilitating its acceptance by economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is therefore important to judge carefully the contribution which the various elements of communication can make to the fulfilment of the primary objective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">Such considerations apply for example to the issue whether the ECB should publish forecasts for euro area variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Forecasts represent information which is important for monetary policy decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, publishing forecasts as a central bank is different from publishing forecasts as an outside institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It is the objective of the ECB to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">Since the objective of the ECB is to achieve this over the medium term, any forecast, which is for example based on constant interest rates, does not take into account that monetary policy takes action in time to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In other words, while forecasts may inform interest rate decisions, there should, in principle, never be any doubt that after the ECB's decision the outlook for price developments should be in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.99,0)">In this context, it would then be problematic to send signals into the public debate, which could influence inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Furthermore, in the construction of forecasts, behavioural, institutional and structural uncertainties should not be overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.38,0)">Large uncertainties can make forecasting price and other developments in the euro area inevitably difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Forecasts have therefore to be interpreted with great caution and an assessment has to be supplemented by an evaluation of risks and uncertainties underlying the forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.32,0)">Therefore, publishing just a single number for the inflation outlook would clearly be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Instead, a careful interpretation of the results is required in order to exploit the signals for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Before the ECB publishes any forecasts, it is crucial that we explain carefully the uncertainties surrounding it, the assumptions being made and to what extent then forecasts actually play a role in our decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.86,0)">Otherwise, publishing forecasts might finally increase uncertainty and even complicate the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Let me point out that the ECB has set high standards in terms of openness, transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As part of its communication policy, the ECB provides the public and other policy makers regularly with timely and detailed information on the Governing Council's assessment of monetary, financial and economic conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This assessment reveals forward-looking information of the outlook for price developments as well as the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.63,0)">A statement of the President is released immediately after the first Governing Council meeting each month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This has the advantage of presenting the Council's assessment of the economic situation almost instantaneously after the meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">Each month the ECB publishes a bulletin providing additional background information to explain its current assessment of monetary, financial and other economic developments in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.75,0)">Once a year, the ECB releases an annual report on its activities to the European Community institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Gaining first experience The monetary policy strategy has passed its first tests successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition to the described elements of the strategy, consistency and transparency of the Eurosystem's monetary policy decisions were a crucial aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This can be best illustrated by discussing the most important factors influencing the interest rate changes decided so far by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.04,0)">In the first few months of last year, signs emerged that the extent of the slowdown of economic activity in the euro area might be stronger than had been anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">At that point in time price pressures continued to be weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.83,0)">In this environment it became increasingly clear that the negative effects stemming from the crises in Asia and Russia on growth and employment in the euro area represented a downward risk to future price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.9,0)">This assessment was also reflected in the downward revisions to the inflation forecasts of international organisations at that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.77,0)">A monetary policy reaction to these downward risks to price stability was, however, complicated by the fact that at that time some indicators appeared to point in the opposite direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, the three-month average of annual growth rates of M3 was slightly above the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Consumer confidence remained comparatively strong despite the economic slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.43,0)">Furthermore, oil prices had been rising since mid-February and the euro had depreciated in effective terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">These two factors were also able to exert upward pressures on prices in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.79,0)">However, there were several indications that M3 was temporarily being distorted upwards in early 1999 as a result of the changeover to Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thus, in early 1999, it did not appear that M3 growth revealed upside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.88,0)">Moreover, since most of what could be assessed by then was a normalisation and correction of excessive developments in late 1998, the Governing Council did not regard it as appropriate to overemphasise relatively volatile movements in oil prices and exchange rates in the first few months of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.89,0)">All in all, while in early April the first pillar of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem was not judged as pointing to upward risks to price stability, the second pillar of the strategy was signalling significant downward risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This assessment made it necessary for the Governing Council to take action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.13,0)">With a view to maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term, the Governing Council of the ECB thus decided at the beginning of April 1999 to reduce the interest rates on the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 2.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">At around the beginning of the summer, it appeared that the downward risks to price stability receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Over the summer, the three-month average of the annual rate of M3 growth increased further and progressively approached a rate of 6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Overnight deposits and credit to the private sector continued to expand rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">A protracted monetary expansion was thus evident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, the external environment strengthened as the Asian economies stabilised and then started to recover, while concerns for financial crises in other emerging markets receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In this environment, economic activity in the euro area progressively recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.69,0)">In addition, the effective exchange rate of the euro weakened further and oil prices continued to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These two factors were gradually feeding through to consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Therefore, information contained in both pillars provided evidence that the balance of risks to future price stability had been progressively moving upward since the beginning of the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.73,0)">The downside risks which were present at the time of the cut in ECB interest rates in April no longer prevailed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">On 4 November the Governing Council decided to raise the interest rates on the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 3.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The increase in interest rates at that point in time was aimed at helping to counter the upward pressure on future prices and at contributing to keeping inflation expectations safely below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The interest rate decision was taken in a timely manner so as to avoid the need for stronger measures later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This is consistent with the focus on maintaining price stability and would thus contribute to sustaining non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In late 1999 and by 2000 risks to price stability moved again to the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Both pillars were indicating increased risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Considering the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, monetary and credit growth continued to signal generous liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Monetary expansion remained high as evidenced by the latest three-month average of annual M3 growth of 6.1% for the period covering October to December 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The expansion of credit to the private sector continued to be strong with rates around 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">These developments were indicative of a continuation of a generous liquidity situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.81,0)">As for the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the oil price and exchange rate movements observed in late 1999 and January 2000 have added to upward pressure on prices in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In fact, price and cost increases were larger and more protracted than foreseen earlier and hence indicated renewed upward risks for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The latest price developments for the euro area were reflecting this pattern, given a pick-up in the HICP inflation rate to 1.7% for December 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Adding to these risks was the fact that the international environment has been showing continuous signs of improvement and the prospects of a cyclical upswing in the euro area have improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, significant improvements in the economic outlook were confirmed by estimates of real GDP growth for the third quarter of 1999 from Eurostat and by available confidence indicators that pointed to a continued solid output growth in the fourth quarter of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Against this background the Governing Council decided to raise ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in February 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.02,0)">The explanations of the decisions to change ECB interest rates in 1999 and in February 2000 show that we do not react mechanistically to individual indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Instead, we always interpret the movements and signals in all of the indicators evident in both pillars in conjunction with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As outlined and given that we are living in a complex world, this is a more reasonable approach than relying on a simple indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Timely and appropriate monetary policy adjustments should ensure that the risks to price stability are kept under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The Governing Council's determination to counter threats of inflation should assure wage negotiators that the prospects for price stability remain favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In fact, it will be important to ensure that wage settlements themselves do not constitute a threat to price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The international role of the euro Let me turn to the implications the introduction of the euro had for the international capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The euro has become the currency of an economic area which roughly equals the United States in terms of economic size and external trade, and which has the world's second largest capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Owing to the fact that a number of the currencies replaced by the euro had played an important international role in the past, the euro inherited this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">After the US dollar, the euro is the second most widely used currency in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In parallel with growing investors' confidence and as more EU Member States join the euro area, in particular following an EU enlargement, the international role of the euro will receive further stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me emphasise that the Eurosystem does not actively promote the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Instead a neutral stance has been adopted leaving the determination of the international role to market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Maintaining price stability in the euro area helps to gain credibility and the confidence of European citizens in the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This will also contribute to the increased use of the euro outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The international interest in the euro is indeed evident, for example, from international new bond issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.37,0)">According to information from the Bank for International Settlements, in the first three quarters of 1999, euro-denominated gross international issues of money market instruments, bonds and notes accounted for 38% of total issues, which is only slightly less than the share for the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.8,0)">By comparison, in the first nine months of 1998 the combined share of the former euro area national currencies and the ECU was only 24% of total gross issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Although this strong increase can be partly explained by the postponement of issues from 1998 to 1999, the issues in euro have been growing continuously in the course of 1999 not least owing to positive expectations regarding the future development of the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Towards a long future of the euro Let me now try to look ahead towards the challenges which the ECB and the Eurosystem will have to address in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The experience with the short past of the euro justifies expectations that we will gradually see further advances towards a broadening of economic and monetary integration in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">With the establishment of the Eurosystem, solid foundations for a stable currency were laid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Moreover, the principle of central bank independence is anchored in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me emphasise that Monetary Union in Europe has a different quality from the German currency union in 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">German unification led to the introduction of the Deutsche Mark in eastern Germany based on a fixed conversion rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Monetary Union in Germany was thus achieved at the same time as the political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, in Europe the establishment of Monetary Union has preceded the creation of a wider political area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This made it necessary to introduce additional features in the framework of EMU so as to enhance the co-ordination between monetary and economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For example the establishment of the Stability and Growth Pact facilitates the co-ordination of fiscal policies among Member States on the basis of a fiscal rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies also facilitate the ECB's task to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact is a crucial element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Its aim is to encourage the pursuit of disciplined and sustainable fiscal policies by both the participating EU Member States and prospective members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Safeguarding sound government finances is conducive to achieving sustainable growth and employment creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The consolidation of public finances, which has made considerable progress in the past few years, has to be continued and, where necessary, strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">There are important conditions to be met in order to achieve sustainable non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In particular, decisive measures to address the structural problems in Europe are needed, for example in the area of labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">Even, if we see some progress in reducing unemployment in the euro area over recent months, this problem is still pressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">There is no doubt that it needs to be tackled by policies enhancing the flexibility of the euro area labour and goods markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In the coming years, the success of EMU demands that the division of policy responsibilities between monetary and government authorities, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, is followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This allows the Euroystem's monetary policy to focus on its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">At the same time economic policies can be directed more efficiently towards structural problems prevailing in the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Such a sharing of tasks is both transparent and conducive to accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It enhances the credibility of monetary and economic policies in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">The focus on price stability does not allow the conditioning of monetary policy actions upon the prospective results of fiscal and structural measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Similarly, monetary policy cannot be conditional on future wage developments promised by the social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In both cases the outcome is quite uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.01,0)">The public could falsely interpret such a form of policy co-ordination as the attempt to negotiate the ECB's monetary policy stance with other policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.08,0)">This might hinder the Eurosystem's prompt response to shocks that threaten the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Eurosystem should always take into account all available information, not just the information on intended other policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In the future, we will also see the accession of a number of new Member States to the European Union and eventually to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">It is clear that the envisaged extension of the EU to include new members and, ultimately, the enlargement of the euro area represent important challenges both for Member States and for the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Any enlargement of the euro area is subject to the strict application of the convergence criteria, and not automatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I should like to recall that the Maastricht Treaty provides for a clear and transparent procedure, which lays down the conditions for EU Member States wishing to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This should ensure that Member States provide evidence of sufficient economic convergence with the euro area before adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this context it is useful to explain the rationale behind the convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Their main purpose is to ensure that only those Member States which have economic conditions that are conducive to the maintenance of price stability shall be participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This is important for the credibility and sustainability of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It makes the case for a strict application of the criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As the convergence criteria constitute a coherent and integrated package, they must be all satisfied at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Current data represent the basis for an assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">An application shall be carried out in a consistent, transparent and simple manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This implies that a convergence assessment shall also take into account the experience gained in the run-up to Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Compliance with the convergence criteria on a sustained basis is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This can be best explained for the example of fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Looking back, many accession countries have accumulated high or very high levels of public sector debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.44,0)">This was often the result of economic shocks, distributional or intergenerational problems as well as regional divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.42,0)">An unduly high stock of debt typically steers debt-service payments for both current and future budgets until debt levels are substantially reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Exchange rate stability is also a measure of overall convergence, given that exchange rate movements typically reflect, in addition to market expectations, relative movements of economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In this regard, participation in ERM II fosters convergence for prospective euro area members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The introduction of the euro in other countries will require more than only compliance with the convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In particular, further preparatory work in various areas is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For example, new members have to ensure that the harmonised framework in which the single monetary policy operates is fully in place prior to their participation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Statistics need further adaptation so as to comply with the Eurosystem's reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Some changes in national legislation are needed to formally lay the foundations for the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Finally, all procedures that involve the Eurosystem and the prospective member country will have to pass a number of real-time tests in order to demonstrate that the infrastructure is operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Conclusions In summary, looking at the current evidence on the outlook for price stability, the first year of operation of the ECB has been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem has proved to be a valuable tool both in supporting monetary policy decisions and in explaining these decisions to the general public in a transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The ECB does its utmost to maintain price stability in the euro area in a forward-looking manner and with a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB vigilantly monitors the signals provided by the two pillars of the ECB's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Stable prices are the best contribution monetary policy can make to sustained economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Maintaining price stability in the euro area will contribute to the credibility of the single monetary policy and to the stability of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">It will pave the way for the long future of the euro.</span>
