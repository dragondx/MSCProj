    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> The monetary pillar of the ECB Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB“The ECB and Its Watchers VII” Conference3 June 2005 Today’s conference “The ECB and Its Watchers” is the seventh of its kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I would like to thank the organisers for this outstanding opportunity to communicate and maintain an open dialogue with market participants, academics and journalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the ECB, this open dialogue has not always been a bed of roses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">To avoid any misunderstanding: we at the ECB – and I personally – have benefited considerably from this regular exchange of views, and I would not have wanted to miss this opportunity or the many other opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.16,0)">Especially in the early days, we were confronted with substantial criticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">Our two-pillar monetary strategy, in particular, came under fire from many sides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.75,0)">Critical central bank watchers at these conferences and beyond, argued that the monetary pillar did not provide any useful information for our monetary policy decisions, and was therefore superfluous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.85,0)">They felt it would be an obstacle to transparency and clear communication with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.29,0)">While, with time, our monetary policy has increasingly been seen in a more positive light, recent experience – where a high growth rate of M3 has not prompted an interest rate increase – is sometimes seen as further evidence of the superfluous, even confusing, role of the monetary pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.9,0)">It comes as no surprise therefore when outside commentators advise us to abandon the monetary pillar or “merge” it with the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.56,0)">In my presentation today, I would like to address this type of criticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">First, I will explain why we rely – and will continue to rely – on the monetary pillar of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will then present the tools which we have developed in our monetary analysis to extract inflationary signals from monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally, I will illustrate how we communicate the results of the monetary analysis to the public to explain our monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The key messages I would like to convey today are as follows: After 6½ years the success of the ECB’s monetary policy is beyond dispute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">We have delivered on our mandate: price stability for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Medium to long-term inflation expectations have been firmly anchored at healthy levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This success, which few expected seven years ago when the ECB was created, is founded on the two-pillar strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A thorough analysis of monetary developments has played a key role in this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The monetary pillar has been essential for the medium-term orientation of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Over time, the continuous deepening and broadening of our monetary analysis has enabled us to cope with different developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.61,0)">The main challenge for monetary analysis remains the real-time extraction of signals of medium-term inflationary or deflationary pressures from monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.64,0)">In recent years, this task has become particularly important, but also more challenging, as sizeable shifts in money demand resulted in some signs of instability in traditional relationships between money, output and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">We have been successful in disentangling, in real time, money demand shocks and noise in monetary developments from the relevant underlying trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The information provided by the monetary analysis has been consistent over time, helping to overcome the limited reliability of other indicators, such as the output gap, and the unavoidable limitations of economic analyses, such as macroeconomic projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As we made clear from the outset, our approach is not a kind of dogmatism; it demonstrates a constant reflection, learning and practical validation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Cross-checking the information from the economic and monetary pillars has enhanced the robustness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The indicator role of money has been a guiding element of our assessment in a situation of continued economic and financial uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We have consistently communicated the role of the monetary pillar and any uncertainty related to monetary developments to market participants, other external experts and the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The high predictability of our decisions suggests that we have been able to successfully explain our policy in a transparent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">All in all, our experience with the two-pillar strategy is unambiguously positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Importantly, it also adds to the renewed role assigned to money in economic research and the revival of interest in money and its counterparts by other central banks in the context of recent asset price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.63,0)">It should be obvious therefore that the burden of proof is indeed on the side of those who suggest that we should neglect the information stemming from monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The role of money for monetary policy There are a number of empirical and theoretical arguments for giving money an important role in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The long-term relationship between money and prices reflects what many economists would consider one of the fundamental relationships in economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.07,0)">A sustained increase in money growth in excess of what is needed to finance transactions in the economy at constant prices will ultimately be associated with inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.09,0)">Equally, prolonged and substantial deflation is accompanied by monetary contraction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The link between money growth and inflation – one of the most robust empirical findings in economics – has again recently been confirmed, also for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Empirical evidence suggests that the link between money and inflation is more prominent at the medium to longer-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The association between money and prices over the medium term suggests that money may be a natural indicator for future inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The empirical properties of money as a leading indicator for inflation are more favourable in the euro area than in other countries/areas and are well-documented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">The results vary across monetary aggregates, since money holdings may be held for different transaction or savings motives and allow for different substitution effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Based on this work, the broad monetary aggregate M3 seems to have predictive power for inflationary pressures at horizons longer than those contained in other real and financial indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In addition, money may have an indicator role to complement or replace other economic variables measured with delay or uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The availability of euro area statistics is improving, making the timeliness of data less problematic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.01,0)">But this does not resolve the continuous real-time uncertainty associated with economic measures such as the output gap or the natural real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.36,0)">It has been argued that mis-measurement of the output gap in real time has contributed to misguided economic policy decisions in some countries in the past  and that monetary aggregates may be a helpful indicator of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Moreover, historical experience has shown that an analysis of money and credit developments can provide information in advance of a build-up of asset price overvaluations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.04,0)">Historically, many episodes of asset price “bubbles” have tended to be either accompanied or preceded by strong money and credit dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.68,0)">This holds, in particular, for booms which, at some point, ended in a collapse of asset prices which had a major and lasting negative impact on the financial sector, the real economy and thereby also on price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Monitoring money and credit aggregates can therefore help us to identify the build-up of financial imbalances and, in conjunction with the developments in asset prices and nominal spending, may help monetary policy to avoid such instabilities, even in cases in which developments in the prices of goods and services appeared to be benign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.75,0)">Giving a role to money and credit can therefore reduce the risk of monetary policy accommodating an asset price bubble which could possibly undermine price stability over rather long horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In this sense, the monetary pillar can help to overcome certain limitations of strict inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.84,0)">Economic research had, for several years, neglected money as a major building block to understanding monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">More recently, however, a number of studies have put money back into monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Theoretical research has helped to rationalise the signalling or indicator role of money and underscored its usefulness for guiding monetary policy decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It has been argued, for instance, that money may play a role as a proxy for a broad range of yields and asset prices that may otherwise be difficult to observe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The money stock then provides additional information about determinants of aggregate demand not apparent in directly observable interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">When the economy is subject to different demand and supply shocks, money may also help the central bank to better identify the type of shocks affecting the economy by providing a clearer and more discriminating picture of the source of the shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This allows central banks to better infer the appropriate path of the policy interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Assigning a role to a broad monetary aggregate in a central bank’s analysis is conducive to better economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.41,0)">In addition, weaknesses of simple feedback rules only focusing on inflation and output have been uncovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.25,0)">Such rules do not deliver a unique and determinate solution to the policy problem of how to keep macroeconomic magnitudes safely anchored to the policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Monitoring monetary developments can provide one nominal anchor, among others, overcoming the possible instability of simple feedback mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In practice, most central banks monitor and analyse monetary aggregates and their components and counterparts, and report on developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">The weight they assign to this analysis in their policy, however, varies widely, and may change over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">More recently some central banks seem to have again placed greater emphasis on the analysis of money and credit aggregates in the context of real estate and asset price fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What role money effectively plays as an element of a central bank’s overall assessment of the economy depends on a) the concrete monetary policy strategy of a central bank, and b) how the central bank pursues and communicates this strategy in view of the empirical performance of monetary aggregates and their counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Whatever the approach taken in pursuing the objective of price stability, no central bank can afford to exclude such information from its overall assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Relevant information should be given the appropriate weight in the structure of the monetary policy decision-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The assessment of risks to price stability, which can be extracted from monetary developments, must not be neglected in policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">For the ECB, the existence of a monetary pillar ensures that money is given its appropriate weight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As long as monetary aggregates and economic developments cannot be modelled in a robust, fully integrated way, it seems preferable to maintain the complementary perspectives on the working of the economy as a whole in the form of two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The decision to create a monetary pillar took into account the above considerations as well as the evidence of a long-term relationship between monetary aggregates and prices and the leading indicator role of money for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In line with the argument of a closer relationship between money and inflation at lower frequencies, the function ascribed to the monetary pillar is to reveal medium-term risks to price stability underpinning the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Moreover, the Governing Council announced a reference value for the growth rate of M3 compatible with the objective of price stability based on the evidence of long-term money demand stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.96,0)">However, as already made public in October 1998, there is no mechanical monetary policy reaction to deviations of M3 growth from the reference value and the reference value clearly does not constitute a monetary target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The strategy was thoroughly scrutinised and evaluated in 2003 after some years of experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As a result of this exercise, the role of the monetary pillar was confirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Cross-checking the indications from the economic analysis with the information from the monetary pillar was emphasised as a crucial element underpinning the robustness and medium-term policy orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Real-time monetary analysis For central bankers the key question is always: how can we translate the principles of a strategy and developments we observe into practical policy advice in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The main challenge for monetary analysis as a tool for monetary policy lies in the successful real-time extraction of those fundamental signals from monetary developments that are linked to future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The separation of these fundamental signals from noise is often possible ex post with relatively simple tools and models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In real time, this separation poses considerable challenges and requires a permanent refinement of the analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It requires a continuous monitoring of the long-term relationship between money and prices and the leading indicator properties of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.55,0)">As we have experienced recently, standard money demand relationships may show signs of instability due to temporary or permanent changes in the behaviour of the money holding sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary analysis therefore employs a wide range of tools – a combination of model-based and institutional analyses – to carry out this real-time assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Rather than unpacking the toolbox  and describing each individual tool here in an abstract way, let me briefly give you an example of how the signals contained in monetary developments regarding future inflationary trends have been extracted recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.17,0)">The past four years have been particularly challenging for the ECB’s monetary pillar because the very rapid expansion of M3 that we observed cannot be easily explained in terms of the traditional determinants of monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">From 2001 to 2003, annual growth of M3 was well above the reference value and the strong upward dynamics in this broad monetary aggregate could only partly be explained by developments in the traditional determinants of money demand, such as output, prices and interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A deep and broad analysis of components and counterparts of M3, capital market flows and the global liquidity situation was needed to single out signals from noise in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.23,0)">Based on this analysis, the ECB identified extraordinary portfolio shifts into M3 – due to heightened economic and financial uncertainty in the aftermath of declining stock prices in 2001 and the terrorist attacks of 9/11 – as the main driver behind the strong monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">This implied modest medium-term risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To quantify this assessment, an M3 series corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts was constructed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">When analysed in parallel with the official M3 series, this enabled us to derive two scenarios for assessing inflationary risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The modal scenario was derived from the input of M3 corrected into the simple models that help us forecast inflation on the basis of monetary information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">By contrast, the input of official M3 time series into the same models resulted in higher inflation forecasts reflecting, by difference, further possible upward risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The assessment of modest medium-term risks to price stability stemming from the monetary analysis changed in the second half of 2004, when broad money growth accelerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This acceleration has been judged to be of a different quality to that observed between 2001 and 2003, as monetary dynamics have strengthened in parallel with increasing demand for loans to the private sector and, importantly, high M3 growth has been driven by its most liquid components, pointing to a significant impact of the low level of interest rates on monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.53,0)">At the same time, financial market uncertainties had been considerably lower than between 2001 and 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This has led to a convergence of M3 and M3 corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In such an environment, the likelihood that strong monetary developments find their way through to higher prices is considerably higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.05,0)">However, given that the signals from the two pillars pointed in different directions, the stability of policy rates cannot be taken as an indication that the Governing Council disregarded the ample liquidity situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The ample liquidity signalled from the monetary analysis was a medium-term factor weighting against a further lowering of interest rates at that stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For a detailed analysis of the above issues, see the Annex to this paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">An answer to the question of the relevance of the monetary pillar for monetary policy cannot be found by looking at the simple correlation of broad monetary aggregates with policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Indeed, the information on the signals for medium-term risks to price stability is the result of a much broader monetary analysis than a simple glance at headline M3 could reveal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.3,0)">In addition, expecting any proof from simple correlations overlooks the crucial role of cross-checking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">It is the combination of economic and monetary analysis which drives monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion To sum up, the experience of the first 6½ years, together with theoretical and empirical findings, leads us to a number of straightforward conclusions: In its assessment and policy considerations, a central bank cannot ignore the information from monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">To analyse developments of money and credit, the ECB has broadened and deepened its tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">By cross-checking the available information, the two-pillar approach guarantees the medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">It has certainly been a learning process and the outcome of a lot of efforts invested in that area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In this sense, you can also think of the monetary pillar as the institutionalised promise of what the ECB will continue to do in the future; cultivating, as far as possible, an approach to central banking geared towards constant learning and encompassing all available information relevant for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Annex : Experience in real-time monetary analysis between 2001 and early 2005 From 2001 to 2003: distorted signals from money for risks to price stability Over the past four years, we have come to experience the complexity and challenges of using money as a policy signal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Indeed, as early as 2001, annual money growth was well above the reference value, and a sequence of positive shocks in traditional money demand models could be observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In other words, to a significant extent, the strong upward dynamics in money growth could not be explained by developments in the traditional determinants, such as output, prices and interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.77,0)">This raised a number of fundamental questions that had to be addressed in real time, for example: Are the strong increases in money part of a fundamental signal pointing to risks to price stability, or do they reflect a temporary phenomenon which is not relevant for monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Would a continuation of the sequence of positive shocks to money demand point to a permanent change in the money demand behaviour of economic agents, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">a structurally higher liquidity preference and, hence, an increase in the direct level of money holdings?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.75,0)">Should we interpret signs of instabilities in specific econometric money demand models as structural changes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.38,0)">Or could the same empirical observation be a corollary of the build-up of imbalances pointing towards risks to future price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">It is not possible to give a satisfactory answer to such questions by means of statistical or econometric inference in real time on the basis of the M3 time series itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A derivation of a useful policy signal under these circumstances thus requires a broad and deep analysis that enables us to single out the relevant signal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB has carried out such an analysis based on a thorough examination of the components and counterparts of M3 and international capital flows, financial market situations and global liquidity situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some of the key questions raised and answers provided by the monetary analysis in this context have been as follows: 1) Which components of M3 showed strong dynamics between 2001 and 2003?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Answer: the increase in monetary dynamics from 2001 to early 2003 had been driven to a significant extent by increases in money market fund shares/units that are often used to “park” money in times of high uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">2) Which counterparts of M3 have contributed to strong M3 dynamics?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Answer: an important driver of monetary developments from the counterparts of M3 has been the net purchase of non-monetary securities rather than money creation via credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">The analysis of the net external position of euro area monetary financial institutions and their further breakdown in the monetary presentation of the balance of payments revealed that, in particular, the repatriation of equity capital from abroad has influenced this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Non-euro area residents have therefore been an important counterpart for strong monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.34,0)">3) Is there model-based evidence for a shock to monetary developments driven by stock market developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.28,0)">Answer: simple structural models that include stock market variables hint at a significant “liquidity preference shock”, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.24,0)">a shock that affects the level of money and the level of the stock market index in an adverse way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.08,0)">Of course, the imbalances and strong signals provided by the exceptional monetary developments of 2001 to 2003 may have been driven by a combination of various reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The ECB has consistently followed up on an analysis originally pursued in real time which has helped to isolate the relevant signal in monetary dynamics for the inflationary outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Spring 2001 marked the start of extraordinary portfolio shifts into M3, as the combination of declining equity prices and worsening economic conditions led to a rise in the demand for safe and liquid monetary assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This process received a significant additional impetus in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, which led to a considerable further rise in financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In order to assess and quantify this analysis, an M3 series corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts was constructed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">When assessed in parallel with the official M3 series, it enabled us to better express uncertainties related to monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">More specifically, the analysis of both time series enabled us to derive two scenarios for assessing inflationary risks: The modal scenario could be derived using M3 corrected as an input into simple monetary models that forecast inflation, for example simple leading indicator models based on monetary growth indicators or P-star models based on measures of the money gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The second scenario, reflecting possible upward risks to price stability as compared to the modal view, could be derived by using the official M3 series and by applying the tools referred to earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In order to visualise this point, we should compare the real-time forecast for annualised HICP inflation forecasts over six quarters from a simple forecast model as described in Nicoletti-Altimari   with the corresponding realised inflation rates over the same horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">Figure 1 makes this comparison for those forecasts from 2001 onwards, for which realised inflation is currently available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.05,0)">It is clear that official M3 developments have not been a reliable guide to price developments over this period, given the magnitude of portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Most importantly, the figure shows that a thorough monetary analysis – using the series of M3 corrected as derived in real time – has produced a useful insight into inflation dynamics by offering close to unbiased inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In this respect, it is important to note that the estimates of the corrections to M3 have remained relatively consistent during the last few years, which is a key issue for deriving reliable monetary policy messages in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council took this real-time assessment of the monetary pillar into account and communicated from October 2001 onwards its assessment of the accelerated monetary growth in view of portfolio shifts: “… a number of temporary factors play an important role in explaining recent monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.91,0)">Notably the uncertainty in stock markets and the relatively flat yield curve until August have led to portfolio shifts... For these reasons, we do not judge that monetary developments signal risks to price stability at this juncture.”  As early as February 2002, the Governing Council indicated that this assessment might have to be revised if there was further evidence of a recovery in the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.18,0)">In autumn 2002 it became apparent that the expected economic recovery would not materialise quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">When cross-checking this information with the monetary pillar, the Council considered that, in view of the temporary factors boosting monetary growth and the expected unwinding for portfolio shifts, monetary developments did not pose a risk to price stability, and decided on lower interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This was expressed, among others, by the ECB’s President in the Introductory Statement of March 2003: “The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Although liquidity remains ample, it is not expected at this stage to give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic context and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes.” The subsequent period of stable interest rates was characterised by countervailing economic and monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Signs of a moderate pick-up of economic developments emerged during the second half of 2003 and strengthened in early 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.42,0)">Short-term inflation volatility, due to exogenous shocks and the decelerating growth of the broad monetary aggregate, did not suggest any clear medium-term inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.08,0)">However, the Governing Council also made reference to the low level of interest rates as a factor driving monetary growth, increases in loans to the private sector and uncertainty about the pace at which portfolio shifts would unwind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The second half of 2004 and early 2005: change in the quality of money growth The assessment of modest medium-term risks to inflation stemming from the monetary analysis changed in the second half of 2004, when broad money growth accelerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">This acceleration, though less pronounced, has been judged to be of a different quality to that observed between 2001 and 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, since the second half of 2004, monetary dynamics have strengthened in parallel with increasing demand for loans to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the component side, high M3 growth has been driven by high growth in the most liquid components of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">By contrast, financial market uncertainties have been considerably lower than between 2001 and 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Stock market indices have recovered from their lows in 2003, leading to a convergence of the growth of M3 and M3 corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In such an environment, the likelihood of strong monetary developments, largely driven by the low level of interest rates all along the maturity spectrum, finding their way through to higher prices is considerably higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For example, it remains likely that part of strong monetary dynamics is part of a fundamental signal that hints at risks to future price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.5,0)">In addition, the Governing Council pointed to the possible impact of strong monetary and credit growth on asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These increased risks to price stability can be visualised by a simple candle chart showing the ranges of real-time inflation forecasts from simple leading indicator models six quarters ahead using a number of monetary variables, as shown in Figure  This figure shows the range of the respective real-time inflation forecasts   together with the median of the forecasts for each of the last seven quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">These real-time forecasts show that the median and the minimum of the inflation forecasts have been above 2% throughout 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.84,0)">Moreover, the breadth of the range of forecasts was considerably smaller in 2004 than in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">This narrowing of the range reflects the convergence of developments in monetary and loan growth and the recent co-movements of the growth in M3 and M3 corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This assessment was further confirmed when looking at money gaps derived for headline M3 and M3 corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Despite the large uncertainties prevailing – as expressed by the large differences in the level of the estimated money gap – the estimated nominal and real money gaps based on M3 and for M3 corrected showed upward movements during 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Thus, there was no ambiguity in terms of the risks of monetary developments to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">As a result, the Governing Council stressed its concern at these developments more forcefully from mid-2004 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">With more cloudy economic indicators emerging towards the end of 2004, it was noticed that these risks might not materialise, but continued to warrant vigilance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">As the Introductory Statement of November 2004 concluded: “To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still contained, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.98,0)">It is particularly important that these do not affect long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Cross-checking with the monetary analysis continues to support the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability.” The stability of policy rates does not therefore indicate that the Council disregarded the ample liquidity situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The ample liquidity signalled from the monetary analysis was a medium-term factor weighting against a further lowering of interest rates at that stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">Figure 1 Real-time forecasts of inflation using M3 and M3 corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio shifts in a simple bivariate leading indicator model*   * see Nicoletti-Altimari   for details.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">Measures of the real and nominal money gaps   The measure of the nominal money gap is defined as the difference between the actual level of M3 and the level

defined as the difference between the actual level of M3 deflated by the HICP and the deflated level of M3 that would have resulted from constant nominal M3 growth at its reference value of 4½% and HICP inflation in line with the ECB’s definition of price stability, taking December 1998 as the base period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.68,0)">Figure 3 The range of annualised
