    <h3> Speaker: Fabio Panetta </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)"> Sustainable finance: transforming finance to finance the transformation Keynote speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 50th anniversary of the Associazione Italiana per l’Analisi Finanziaria   25 January 2021 Introduction I would like to start by thanking the Italian Association for Financial Analysts   for inviting me to speak on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Promoting high standards in financial analysis is vitally important for guaranteeing the development and the integrity of markets, to ensure they can serve the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The work performed by the AIAF over the past 50 years in the fields of research, training and reporting and its strong ties with financial operators and savers have helped bring Italian standards in line with international best practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The AIAF’s ability to keep pace with innovation is clearly reflected in its commitment to sustainable finance, the subject of my speech today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In recent years, addressing climate change and the transition to a sustainable development model more broadly have become increasingly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Under the responsible financing approach, companies still aim to create value while taking into account principles such as fair compensation for employees, respect for ethical and social values and environmental protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Sustainable finance – also known as responsible finance – incorporates environmental, social and governance   principles into the decision-making processes of financial operators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">It represents an important change designed to ensure the financial system is used for the benefit of our collective well-being; in doing so, it has become a vital tool for addressing climate-related risks, which have become increasingly prominent due to the emergence of irreversible damage to the environment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In my speech today, I will consider the debate on sustainable development and climate-related risks in the light of the shock caused by the coronavirus   pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">I will then examine what can be done to strengthen the impact of responsible finance on the economic system and the ECB’s role in tackling climate-related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Sustainable development and climate-related risks in the time of the pandemic The challenge to find a sustainable development path which meets the needs of present generations without compromising the well-being of future generations is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The German economist Hans Carl von Carlowitz was already thinking about how resources could be used sustainably as early as the 18th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But it was not until the 1970s and the publication of The Limits to Growth  report that the sustainability of the growth model gained prominence as an item on European and international policy agendas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.61,0)">Initial analyses of sustainability focused on the risk of non-renewable natural resources being depleted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This focus has gradually widened to include the extent to which our natural systems can cope with the effects of climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The idea that well-being must take into account factors such as equity – within and across generations – and sustainability was brought to the fore in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, launched by the United Nations in 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In the same year, the Paris Agreement  recognised the need to speed up the economy’s reduction of CO2 emissions and to protect the environment for the benefit of both current and future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.74,0)">In recent months the pandemic shock has caused global economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities to resurface, exacerbating them even further and increasing the risk of greater income inequality and a widening of the wealth gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The pandemic has also emphasised the urgent need to address the problems that are affecting people’s well-being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.76,0)">The UN estimates that the number of people living in poverty worldwide will increase by between 40 and 60 million as a result of the pandemic, undoing the progress made in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.34,0)">We may also see an increase in gender and generational discrimination owing to the severe impact the pandemic is having on women and young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.23,0)">Low-income countries are not the only ones affected by these problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.75,0)">The pandemic could also bring about an increase in poverty , social exclusion, inequality and challenges to achieving universal energy access in advanced economies, many of which were already a long way from reaching the 2030 Agenda  goals before the crisis struck  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.67,0)">These worrying developments, which undermine the foundations of inclusive growth, are accompanied by environmental issues, in particular climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.29,0)">Natural disasters that occurred in 2018 caused more than 20,000 deaths worldwide and deprived 29 million people of livelihoods, resulting in damages estimated at USD 23 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Together with 2016, 2020 was the warmest year on record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.82,0)">Climate scenarios predict that global temperatures will continue to rise over the course of the 21st century, resulting in more frequent and more intense extreme natural events, with negative implications for ecosystems and public health.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.48,0)">Economic activity is both a cause and a victim of climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.5,0)">It is a cause for example due to the use of fossil fuels for energy: three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions are generated from fossil fuel combustion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.9,0)">Climate change has also had an impact on human activities: rising average temperatures, with pronounced fluctuations, affect all sectors, particularly those more susceptible to natural events, such as agriculture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.03,0)">Frequent and intense heatwaves and hydrogeological phenomena can have significant economic consequences, while gradually rising sea levels threaten coastal communities throughout the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">It is clear that we need to ensure the sustainability of our development model, starting by gradually moving away from the use of fossil fuels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In recent months, the steps taken to limit the consequences of the pandemic have temporarily slowed the rise in emissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.92,0)">According to NASA, between February and May 2020 atmospheric CO2 concentrations fell compared to pre-crisis levels to a level consistent with the achievement of the targets set by the Paris Agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">But this will only be a temporary improvement unless climate policy changes course, particularly if there is not an adequate carbon pricing system that penalises emissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The challenge facing us now is how to support general well-being while keeping emissions at levels that comply with the Paris Agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Monetary and fiscal authorities are responding by introducing decisive policies designed to revive development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But we cannot just limit our efforts to returning things to how they were before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">We must seize this opportunity to modernise our economy, reduce social and environmental vulnerabilities and bring about change that makes development sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The contribution of responsible finance In the financial world, interest in sustainable growth has long been limited to a small group of specialist operators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">But things have changed in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The Paris Agreement explicitly recognised the vital role of the financial system in promoting responsible development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Since 2015 ESG investment funds have increased the total assets they manage by over 170%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Between January and October 2020, this category of funds in Europe saw net inflows of more than €150 billion, nearly 80% more than in the same period the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">According to market operators, this trend is set to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.67,0)">Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P. and ECB report  ; Bloomberg Finance L.P., Refinitiv, ECB securities holdings statistics per sector and ECB calculations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">This change of pace primarily reflects the impetus coming from the authorities at global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I have already mentioned the UN’s 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">But awareness of social and environmental issues among young people, who are less inclined than the generations before them to separate consumption and investment decisions from sustainability-related issues, has also had an impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">According to the UN, implementing the 2030 Agenda will require total investment of between USD 5 to 7 trillion per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The European Commission has also estimated that in order for the EU to meet its 2030 climate target, new investment of up to €260 billion per year will be required over the next decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Whether investment programmes of this scale can be implemented will largely depend on the cost and availability of financial resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The lower cost of capital compared with traditional investments – also referred to as the green premium – could encourage the launch of new sustainable projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">However, empirical analyses show that this premium would be small at best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is therefore unrealistic to imagine that the huge volume of investment needed to ensure sustainable development can take place without the involvement of the public sector, for example in order to raise the price of coal by strengthening the emissions trading system  or to support research and development of alternative energy sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In order to boost the contribution made by sustainable finance, the financial instruments offered to investors must be trustworthy and easy to understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Lenders also need to be able to assess whether investment projects are consistent with their own financial and non-financial objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There needs to be detailed information about whether investments meet sustainability criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.79,0)">At the moment, the data available are scarce and of poor quality – for example, the ESG ratings of individual companies produced by a range of analysts are based on different methods and are poorly correlated  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Here too, public sector involvement, in particular effective regulation, is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The European Union is leading the way internationally in terms of regulating sustainable finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">But further progress would be welcome, also in view of the launch of the European Green Deal  and the European Commission’s soon-to-be-published renewed sustainable finance strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive could result in significant progress being made  by expanding the range of companies subject to sustainability reporting requirements, establishing common assessment criteria and ensuring an appropriate degree of data granularity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Empirical evidence indicates that disclosure makes firms pay closer attention to sustainability without worsening their performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The use of this tool by analysts, banks and companies will require further steps, such as approving delegated acts and establishing guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The new regulatory framework will need to offset investors’ information requirements against the need to avoid overly complex and burdensome transparency obligations for issuers, particularly small and medium-sized ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Lastly, the development of sustainable finance requires global cooperation, also considering that around 90% of the global emissions are produced outside Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Coordination is necessary in order to adopt a common set of rules and practices for taxonomies and non-financial reporting criteria, and to establish procedures to prevent opportunistic behaviour and regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This year’s G20 presidency provides Italy with a unique opportunity to put these issues at the top of the international agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.75,0)">What is the ECB’s role?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In recent months the ECB has launched a reflection process to identify policies through which it can contribute to the climate transition in full accordance with its mandate under EU law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU states that the primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The Treaty also states that, as a secondary aim, the ECB shall support the achievement of the EU’s objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And Article 3 of the Treaty includes sustainable development among these objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The monetary policy stance has at best only a negligible impact on environmental risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">This is due to both its very different time horizon compared with climate change  and the fact that it cannot target individual sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, the economic and monetary analysis that underpins the monetary policy stance should also take into account the shocks caused by climate change to both conjunctural and structural developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The ECB can contribute to environmental policies in the implementation of monetary policy – what we refer to as the operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We have already taken steps in this direction, for example by including sustainable finance instruments – the sustainability-linked bonds – among the collateral that can be used in refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">In addition, to ensure that it remains financially sound, the ECB has to protect its balance sheet from the financial risks caused by climate change that are not correctly priced by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">By performing its own analysis of these risks on the basis of rigorous methodologies, the ECB can contribute to the accurate valuation of these climate-related risks and promote awareness among investors, thereby helping to combat climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These issues are currently being considered as part of our monetary policy strategy review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.69,0)">But it is not just monetary policy that is affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.88,0)">Climate change has an impact on the overall stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.71,0)">The most vulnerable intermediaries are those that operate with long time horizons and are exposed to the consequences of extreme events, such as insurance companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">We are currently defining models that could be used to measure the systemic risks caused by climate change, including through specific stress analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision – the ECB’s supervisory arm – has also recently published its expectations on how banks should manage climate and environmental risks in their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Looking ahead, this could then influence banks’ capital and public disclosure, increasing awareness among intermediaries and investors of these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Lastly, the ECB is actively involved in European and international initiatives aimed at improving information on the environmental impact of companies and intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.85,0)">Conclusion Advanced economies have long been characterised by a high level of savings and insufficient investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.49,0)">Productivity growth is subdued, while interest rates and inflation are at historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.27,0)">The pandemic shock has squeezed the spending capacity of households and businesses and caused widespread uncertainty, accentuating these trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Exiting the crisis will require prolonged support from economic policies – both monetary and fiscal – and a significant increase in productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Sustainable investment projects can play a crucial role in helping to reabsorb excess savings and raise growth potential, while also setting out a growth path that reduces social vulnerabilities and counteracts climate and other environmental risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The recovery and resilience plans that European countries are being asked to prepare so that they can access the Next Generation EU funds are an opportunity to relaunch growth, steering it to a sustainable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">If used wisely – to increase human capital, to invest in technology and to protect the environment – these funds can help us transition from a crisis with dramatic implications to an opportunity for progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We need to be bold and forward-looking in seizing this opportunity and do so in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Responsible finance can play an important role in reconciling development with environmental, ethical and social values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The next European strategy on sustainable finance provides an opportunity to align financial flows with these values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The ECB has started to reflect on how it can contribute to responsible development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A central bank that is responsive to the needs of citizens – both now and in the future – has a duty to be mindful of the demands of sustainable development in order to ensure stability in all its forms: first and foremost monetary stability, but financial, environmental and social stability too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I would like to thank Francesco Drudi, Ivan Faiella, Alessandro Giovannini, Jean-François Jamet and Fabio Tamburrini for their extremely helpful comments and valuable contribution to preparing this text.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.65,0)">In
