    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)"> First experiences with the euro Speech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the conference organised by the "Gesprächskreis Nord" of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, on 8 March 1999 in Hamburg Thank you for the invitation to speak here on the occasion of this conference organised by the "Gesprächskreis Nord" of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">It is only two months since the euro was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has been accomplished successfully and the enormous technical and logistical challenges arising during the early days of Monetary Union have been surmounted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The start of Monetary Union proved to be a formidable operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.7,0)">In spite of the operational difficulties and risks involved, the changeover passed without any serious incidents affecting the orderly conditions in the monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The operations of the Eurosystem relating to the conversion of former national currencies into the euro went smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There was no need to invoke any contingency measure, whether "ordinary" or "extraordinary".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The first main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem and the first regular longer-term refinancing operations were also settled successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The introduction of the euro is unprecedented in European history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Although not yet embodied in the physical form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play an important role in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro is present on all major financial markets around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Currency trading is regularly carried out in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There are now shares denominated in euro on most European stock exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Moreover, the euro has attracted new international bond issues as the currency of denomination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In some ways, the introduction of the euro may justify expectations of large efficiency gains in the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">For EU citizens, two obvious gains will be, on the one hand, the reduction of transaction costs and, on the other, increased transparency, which facilitates price comparisons between different goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Monetary Union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Price stability is at the core of the "stability culture" that we are seeking to establish throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">The Governing Council of the European Central Bank   is in charge of monetary policy decisions for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, their implementation rests with the Eurosystem - that is the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The Eurosystem has had the good fortune to assume authority over monetary policy in the euro area in an environment of price stability, owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence within Europe over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy and the Treaty The Treaty on European Union, commonly referred to as the "Maastricht Treaty", assigns the European System of Central Banks   the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In order to give clear guidance for expectations of future price developments, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This clarifies how the Treaty's mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public and the European Parliament clear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.71,0)">As the phrase "increase" makes clear, deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - would not be consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The annual rate of inflation, according to the most recent available data, of 0.8%, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.49,0)">It should also be underlined once again that the monetary policy is a single one and therefore indivisible - by definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Monetary policy decisions must be based on euro area-wide considerations, rather than national considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.64,0)">As simple as it may sound, those commentating on our monetary policy do not always appear to grasp this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Monetary policy needs a forward-looking, medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.5,0)">Monetary policy should not and shall not react to every change in all the information that is produced on an almost daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.74,0)">It would be over-ambitious and therefore risky to try to steer the economy in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.85,0)">Fine-tuning would be more likely to lead to instability than stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To maintain price stability, we have chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present as well as those likely to prevail in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The Eurosystem's stability-oriented monetary policy strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the former strategies of the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, it gives due consideration to the unique situation which will prevail in the early years of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This strategy rests on two "pillars".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">First, broad money is assigned a prominent role in the strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This is deemed to be important on account of the essentially monetary origins of inflation over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole is carried out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Monetary developments can reveal useful information about future price developments and thereby offer an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">There is broad consensus that the development of the price level is a monetary phenomenon in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.19,0)">This takes into account the fact that monetary policy affects the price level only with variable, usually long and unpredictable time lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.59,0)">It is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Furthermore, the historical experience of central banks in Europe and beyond demonstrates that it is important for the success of monetary policy to carry out a thorough analysis of monetary aggregates and the information they contain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for the annual growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.63,0)">Substantial or prolonged deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value should, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The choice of M3 as an aggregate is supported by empirical evidence regarding the long-run stability and leading indicator properties of this aggregate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Moreover, conceptual arguments pointed to the importance of including in the monetary aggregate those assets which have a high degree of substitutability with narrower definitions of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monitoring monetary developments also helps to identify the nature of shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It thereby contributes to the assessment of overall economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.21,0)">Monetary policy does not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a "mechanistic" way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed to infer any signals which they may offer about the prospects for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">If the deviation points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempting to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first reference value for M3 growth has been set at an annual rate of 4½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This reference value is consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It will be reviewed in December 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.87,0)">Although monetary data contain information which is important for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will clearly not constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to take appropriate policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The Governing Council recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth, to look at a wide range of financial and other economic indicators, including economic forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">By fulfilling the unequivocal commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to maintaining price stability in the euro area, we shall ensure that the single monetary policy contributes as much as possible to economic welfare in the broadest sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">At the same time, national fiscal authorities and general economic policies also have to demonstrate their commitment to the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact is a crucial element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Its aim is to encourage the pursuit of disciplined and sustainable fiscal policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In so doing, it can make a significant contribution to the establishment of favourable conditions for sustained economic growth and high employment in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.24,0)">It would be counterproductive if national fiscal policy-makers did not continue their efforts in the light of the achievement of Monetary Union and the currently positive price outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">I am not fully convinced that consolidation efforts are currently being undertaken with sufficient determination in all participating Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.91,0)">The ECB cannot commit itself to take into account, in its overall assessment, any announced, but as yet uncertain, fiscal consolidation in some of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In line with its clear mandate, enshrined in the Treaty, and for sound economic reasons, the ECB has to decide which monetary stance best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term and then act accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">At the same time, the Treaty also emphasises the need for sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This clear separation of responsibilities is both efficient and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.02,0)">Monetary policy alone - even if it is well designed and fully successful in monitoring price stability - cannot solve Europe's economic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Appropriate structural reforms implemented by national governments are of the utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Much progress is required in this broad area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Moreover, responsible wage settlements in both the public and private sectors are necessary to reduce the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Recent wage agreements in some parts of the euro area do not appear to be in the interest of higher employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.07,0)">Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.95,0)">Implementing a monetary policy stance which is more lax than is justified by the monetary, financial and economic conditions will not solve this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.53,0)">Instead it will exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment and savings decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility and efficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">I appreciate that such reforms are not always easy, not least because the benefits which they yield occur mainly in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, they are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.17,0)">In those euro area Member States that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Other euro area Member States are called upon to follow these examples: structural reform throughout the euro area is fundamental to the success of Monetary Union and to improving Europe's economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In this respect, we may also be able to learn something by looking at the reasons behind strong employment growth and low unemployment in some of the Member States of the European Union and in the United States, in particular regarding the flexibility of labour markets and incentives to create and accept new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">Monetary policy decisions and the outlook for price stability Since the start of this year the Governing Council has taken the following main monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In December 1998, the Governing Council of the ECB announced that the level of interest on the main refinancing operation would be 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Since then, the Governing Council has kept this rate unchanged, as it has judged that doing so was serving best the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The 12-month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 increased to 5.7% in January 1999 from 4.5% in December 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This increase is mainly due to rapidly growing overnight deposits, which account for around one-third of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The three-month moving average of M3   increased to 4.9%, that is, slightly above the announced reference value of 4½% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In view of the uncertainty relating to special factors pertaining to the changeover to the Stage Three environment and the introduction of the euro, the Governing Council does not view the recent acceleration in M3 as a signal of future inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">However, monetary developments need to be monitored closely in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.52,0)">With regard to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, new information on indicators of future price developments and economic activity in the euro area continue to provide mixed signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Financial indicators such as the yield curve show that the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates has recently widened somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">This followed the decline in long-term interest rates in January to the lowest levels seen since the late 1940s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Nevertheless, conditions for investment at the start of Monetary Union are favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This relates in particular to the prevailing low interest rate level, which significantly reduces the costs of financing for investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Recent developments appear to have led to a reduction in some of the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">This mainly relates to the strong performance of the US economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In the euro area the latest indicators confirm that those risks which were identified earlier have materialised to some extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.96,0)">Real GDP growth in the euro area, which weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998 compared with the previous quarter, suggests that activity has been slowing down in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.67,0)">This assessment is supported by other indicators, such as decreasing capacity utilisation and industrial confidence, both of which have been on a declining trend since mid-1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">By contrast, consumer confidence continues to present a favourable picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.5,0)">The level of unemployment has remained more or less unchanged over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Recent price developments are consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.53,0)">The latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices show that the downward movement of inflation has stopped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The annual increase for February 1999 was reported to be 0.8%, the same as in the previous month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.51,0)">The current low inflation rate is partly due to substantial reductions in energy prices over the past half year, which have diminished somewhat very recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Decreasing unit labour costs have also made a significant contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.45,0)">In summary, the outlook for price stability remains favourable and, until now, we have not identified anysignificant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.41,0)">On the downward side, the slowdown in the euro area economy is a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.33,0)">On the upward side, increasing wage pressure and a relaxation of the fiscal stance could adversely affect the prospects for future price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Furthermore, recent exchange rate developments will also need to be monitored closely in view of their impact on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the absence of any strong upward or downward pressure on price developments, maintaining the current stance of monetary policy appeared justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Governing Council therefore decided last week that for the two next main refinancing operations the same conditions will apply as for the main refinancing operations settled earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This means they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Interest rates applicable to the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility will continue to be 2.0% and 4.5 % respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Of course, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments and reassess its monetary policy in its bi-weekly meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The international dimension and the exchange rate Let me now turn to the international dimension of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As the representative of a monetary union which is comparable in size and importance with the United States, and as the central bank managing a currency that is likely to play a large and increasingly international role, the ECB will inevitably serve an important function in the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The ECB will embrace the implied responsibility, but, at the same time, it will have to be modest and realistic in its actions in the international arena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB may be expected to contribute to international co-operation by adopting a positive attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The introduction of the euro could potentially simplify the process of international policy co-operation between the major economies, since the number of key players has been reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">In particular, it should make this process more efficient by facilitating the exchange of views and the formulation of common understandings on economic and financial issues at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">With regard to the Eurosystem's relationship with European Community institutions, the Treaty states that the President of the ECOFIN Council and a member of the European Commission may participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, with the right to express their views but without voting power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">Moreover, the ECB is required to disclose to the European Community institutions   an annual report on its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The President of the ECB shall present this report to the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament and also take part in the subsequent debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As announced before, the President will attend the hearings at the European Parliament at least four times a year to discuss the activities of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Finally, I should like to mention that the President of the ECB is also invited to the newly established informal Euro-11 Council meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the field of the international representation of the ECB, some decisions are still under consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Formal and informal agreements have already been reached with the International Monetary Fund  , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development   and in the context of the G7 and the G10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">At the end of last year the IMF granted the ECB the status of observer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">As you will be aware, full membership of the IMF is restricted to individual nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate in the relevant work and assessments by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The ECB stands ready to participate fully in, and contribute to, international policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It will, of course, offer expertise and exchange views when and where appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">However, the best contribution which the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system, including stable exchange rates and smoothly functioning international capital markets, is to maintain price stability within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Fulfilling the mandate assigned to it by the Maastricht Treaty will help the ECB to shoulder its international responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">The Eurosystem takes a neutral stance with regard to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It neither promotes nor hinders the development of the euro as an international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The Eurosystem accepts the international role of the euro as it develops through market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">There will be no deliberate policy of challenging third currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">As yet it is too early to predict how long it will take for the euro to emerge as a truly international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Generally speaking, the commitment of the ECB to successfully fulfilling the mandate of the Treaty, that is to maintaining price stability in the euro area, will contribute to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Allow me to say a few words on certain proposals made in the ongoing public debate, which might suggest that the focus of monetary policy should be shifted towards objectives other than price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some suggestions seem to imply that the Eurosystem should react more or less automatically to exchange rate movements or other specific variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.93,0)">Just as a doctor cannot stop a fever by holding the thermometer under cold water without an appropriate therapy, monetary policy cannot stabilise exchange rates if pressure occurs as a result of diverging cyclical positions, market fundamentals or structural and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.32,0)">Therefore, we deliberately excluded any kind of explicit or implicit exchange rate objectives or targets from our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Nevertheless, the Eurosystem's stability-oriented monetary policy strategy takes into account the external value of the euro as one, potentially important, determinant of the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">If its development poses a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">However, all other factors that impart information on price developments will always be taken into account before a decision will be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.23,0)">Obviously, if a strong and abrupt appreciation of the euro were to occur, this would lead, all other things being equal, to downward pressures on price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">In such a situation, there would be more reason to lower the ECB's interest rates, which might then, in turn, help to counteract part of the prior exchange rate movement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.66,0)">But setting exchange rate targets might, for example, imply that a central bank has to increase its interest rates in a situation of weak demand and downward pressures on prices, just because of a depreciation in the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.45,0)">I think you will agree with me that this might not be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">According to the Maastricht Treaty, the ECOFIN Council may formulate so-called general orientations for the exchange rate policy, which shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECOFIN Council has agreed to issue so-called orientations for exchange rate policy only in exceptional circumstances, such as a clear and sustained misalignment of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In addition, we are not currently participating in a formal exchange rate arrangement with third countries outside the EU, for instance with the United States, and we consider it very unlikely that this situation will change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Accountability and transparency of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem Let me turn to the issues of accountability and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In general, central banks should be open, transparent and accountable, reporting extensively to the public on their activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.43,0)">The issue of the transparency of monetary policy is very important, given that the Eurosystem is a new institution and the public is not accustomed to evaluating its behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Moreover, by communicating clearly with the public, the Eurosystem reinforces its credibility and signals that its monetary policy is appropriately geared to the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In this regard, the Eurosystem's approach bears comparison with the "best practices" of any other central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Accountability is the counterpart to independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We should also be clear that the independence of the ECB does not exclude a dialogue with political authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The monetary policy of the Eurosystem will be held accountable for reaching its overriding objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The Eurosystem is open, transparent and, above all, accountable for its performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As part of its communication strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB regularly informs the public about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and about specific monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Moreover, since January 1999 the ECB has been providing the public with a Monthly Bulletin containing additional and detailed analysis of the economic situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">In some areas the Eurosystem has gone beyond the Treaty requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.52,0)">The Governing Council meets every fortnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">The first meeting in every month is immediately followed by a press conference, in which the President of the ECB and I explain the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On that occasion, the "Introductory Statement of the President" of the Eurosystem is released to the press.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">This is similar to what other central banks call minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">We are convinced that this very prompt delivery of information serves the interests of the public in an optimal way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.92,0)">Few central banks follow a policy of publishing their minutes almost immediately after the meeting of their governing body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We are also convinced that it is in the public interest for the view of the Governing Council as a whole to be presented, rather than the views of individual members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.0,0)">Concluding remarks Let me finally urge caution with regard to any excessively high expectations at the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">History also shows that the full benefits of changes as substantial as the introduction of the euro may come neither immediately nor automatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It normally takes some time to adapt to a new situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Most importantly, efficiency and welfare gains will require structural reforms of labour and goods markets to improve flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">One can only hope that the euro is working as a catalyst for such change.</span>
