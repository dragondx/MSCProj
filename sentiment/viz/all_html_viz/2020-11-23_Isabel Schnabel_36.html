    <span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)"> Shifting tides in euro area money markets: from the global financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB Conference on Money Markets, 23 November 2020 Frankfurt am Main, 23 November 2020 I would like to welcome you warmly to our virtual ECB Conference on Money Markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">This conference offers an excellent platform to facilitate the exchange between academic experts on money markets and policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The conference papers address some of the most topical research questions with respect to money markets and will thus provide valuable input for the implementation of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Money markets are a cornerstone of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Banks, non-bank financial institutions  and non-financial corporations all rely on money markets for their short-term funding, liquidity management and collateral needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.65,0)">As a result, dislocations in money markets can severely undermine the stability of our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Due to their central role as a source of short-term funding, money markets are also crucial for the implementation and transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">Money market rates serve as operational targets for central banks and also as benchmarks for the pricing of credit, thereby directly affecting financing conditions in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">To ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, it is therefore crucial that money market rates are well-aligned with central banks’ policy intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">In the first part of my remarks today, I will briefly describe the major longer-term trends in euro area money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the second part, I will focus on monetary policy transmission through money markets and its key determinants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will devote particular attention to money market functioning during the coronavirus   pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This will allow me to contrast recent developments in money market activity with previous crisis episodes, including the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.82,0)">Longer-term trends in euro area money markets Let me start by illustrating several longer-term trends in euro area money markets and their underlying drivers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Three key factors have shaped the trends in money markets since the global financial crisis: a heightened awareness of counterparty risk, a sharp increase in excess liquidity and regulatory reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The shift towards secured and centrally cleared transactions Perhaps the most striking trend is the shift away from unsecured transactions towards transactions secured by collateral  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The shift towards the secured   market began with the financial and sovereign debt crises and was driven by heightened financial market stress and the significant counterparty risk it exposed for unsecured money market transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The expansion of central bank liquidity provision during and after the global financial crisis substituted for impaired markets and thereby further reduced the need of market participants to rely on money markets for their liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Instead, a substantial part of money market transactions in recent years has been driven by the demand for specific types of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.11,0)">Additionally, as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, unsecured money market transactions have become more costly in terms of bank capital and liquidity requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This development has reinforced the shift towards secured money market transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Another trend is the marked shift in the types of counterparties involved in money market transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">An increasing share of trades is cleared through central counterparties    .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">CCPs mitigate counterparty risk and reduce the reliance on costly collateral by providing netting services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They have been an integral part of the policy response to the shortcomings uncovered by the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Beyond the use of CCPs, the share of transactions between banks and non-banks has gradually increased, whereas banks have lower incentives to transact with each other in the current environment of abundant central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">These trends likely contributed to the relative resilience of short-term money markets since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.26,0)">Secured transactions, a majority of which are cleared by CCPs, have been much less affected by the tensions in the spring than unsecured trades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.18,0)">Changing anchors for money market rates Changes in central bank policies and regulation have also had a significant impact on money market rates, leading, in particular, to changing anchors for money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.63,0)">The financial and sovereign debt crises saw a heightened volatility of money market rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.79,0)">Unsecured rates and repo rates secured by stressed sovereign collateral were particularly affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">Prior to 2008, short-term money market rates had been anchored to the ECB’s Main Refinancing Operations   rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Following the shift to a fixed-rate full-allotment approach, which led to an unprecedented increase in excess liquidity, these rates moved towards the Deposit Facility Rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">This gave rise to an effective shift from a corridor system with scarce liquidity to a floor system with ample   liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.59,0)">After 2015, another shift occurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Repo rates gradually moved below the DFR, starting with repos backed by German and French government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.74,0)">These movements reflected a shortage of safe collateral assets, particularly around regulatory reporting dates such as quarter- and year-ends  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.01,0)">Two factors contributed to a growing scarcity of safe collateral: asset purchases by central banks and regulatory reforms that required banks to increase their holdings of safe and liquid securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.53,0)">Until more recently, these factors were exacerbated by the absence of an effective securities lending programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.68,0)">The €STR rate, which also includes transactions with non-banks, has also edged below the DFR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">One reason for this shift is the segmentation between banks, which have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, and non-banks as well as entities outside of the euro area, which do not have access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.52,0)">The conference paper by Eisenschmidt, Ma and Zhang    studies how this market segmentation can affect monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Monetary policy transmission through money markets I will now turn to the determinants of monetary policy transmission through money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One metric that can be used as an indicator of monetary policy pass-through is the volume-weighted cross-sectional dispersion of money market overnight rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This metric, proposed by Duffie and Krishnamurthy  , is a useful way to combine information on money market rates and volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Intuitively, the dispersion index is low in relatively frictionless markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.85,0)">Increases in dispersion indicate that money market rates do not move in tandem, which can signal impairments in the pass-through of the monetary policy stance to private market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Based on the dispersion index, I will highlight the changing role of factors affecting monetary policy transmission in the euro area through money markets since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will focus on three key factors that have an impact on the transmission of monetary policy decisions through money markets: financial stress, central bank liquidity provision and regulatory changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Financial stress Prior to 2015, financial stress indicators exhibited a strong co-movement with the dispersion index  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.87,0)">However, this relationship has since become less pronounced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.18,0)">The de-coupling of financial stress indicators and the dispersion index is particularly striking during the recent pandemic period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.72,0)">In the spring of 2020, when indicators of financial stress increased dramatically, the dispersion index of overnight money market rates remained at remarkably low levels, mainly owing to the structural shift to largely secured transactions and the high amounts of central bank liquidity outstanding even before the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.2,0)">The low dispersion across overnight rates during the pandemic stands in contrast to the sharp and persistent rise in term money market and commercial paper rates, which points to measurable tensions in other segments of the market  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Commercial paper rates rose quickly as the demand for commercial paper from non-bank financial institutions froze at the height of the pandemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.64,0)">In March 2020, investment and money market funds faced heavy withdrawals from their investors due to a dash for cash and tried to sell off commercial paper before maturity to build up liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.63,0)">The events of the spring therefore clearly demonstrated the extent to which the liquidity management policies of non-banks can have severe ramifications for broader market functioning and hence also for the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.06,0)">In particular, the tensions in the commercial paper market also affected the term unsecured money market, not least because commercial paper rates are often used as a reference for the pricing of EURIBOR under the hybrid methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The Eurosystem reacted decisively to the tensions in financial markets that extended well beyond the money and commercial paper market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">We launched additional liquidity-providing operations for banks against an expanded set of collateral via targeted longer-term refinancing operations   at highly favourable rates, longer-term refinancing operations   as well as foreign currency liquidity arrangements  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In addition, the Eurosystem sharply expanded its purchases of public and private sector assets, which also included purchases of commercial paper, under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme   and the Asset Purchase Programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s policy interventions effectively eased the liquidity strains observed in the spring of 2020 and supported market functioning by ensuring ample liquidity support for banks and stopping self-reinforcing fire-sale dynamics in key financial market segments, such as investment and money market funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The interventions have had a sustained effect on money markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.21,0)">Both EURIBOR and commercial paper rates have continued to recede in recent months and are currently at historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.84,0)">The yield curve in unsecured money markets has flattened substantially even compared to the pre-crisis period  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">These low money market rates support the Eurosystem’s highly accommodative monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Central bank liquidity provision This brings me to the second factor, namely central bank liquidity provision, which influences the effective pass-through of monetary policy decisions to money market rates and financing conditions more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.44,0)">The relation between excess liquidity and overnight money market rate dispersion has also changed since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.53,0)">Prior to 2015, higher levels of excess liquidity tended to lower the dispersion of money market rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">After 2015, increases in dispersion also occurred in periods of ample and rising excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There are several reasons for this changing relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Prior to 2015, central bank liquidity provision and the associated Eurosystem balance sheet expansion were driven by the need to restore an impaired monetary policy transmission mechanism, caused by heightened market stress during the financial and sovereign debt crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.95,0)">During the global financial crisis, when the unsecured interbank market came under stress, banks turned to the central bank to obtain liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">The Eurosystem essentially assumed the liquidity-providing role of the private market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">During the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, banks once again increased their demand for central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The provision of central bank liquidity also stimulated the supply of liquidity in the private market, especially to banks located in the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The optimal design of central bank liquidity policies is an important research question, which is examined in the conference paper by Robatto  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The experience from these two crisis episodes shows that central bank liquidity provision can stimulate market functioning and lower money market rate dispersion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">During the pandemic, this was also clearly visible, as exemplified by the impact of our measures on term money market and commercial paper rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.17,0)">After 2015, excess liquidity was primarily driven by the Eurosystem’s large-scale asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Although excess liquidity reached new highs with the implementation of asset purchases and financial stress remained at relatively low levels, the dispersion index rose substantially in 2015 and 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.04,0)">One factor that could cause such a rise is an uneven distribution of excess liquidity across countries or across banks and non-banks, similar to what had happened in US money markets in September 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, in recent years, the divergence across overnight money market rates was primarily driven by repo rates secured by high-quality collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.12,0)">Research suggests that this increase in the dispersion index can be linked to scarcity effects, as asset purchases and the increased regulatory demand for safe government bonds withdrew collateral assets from the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">To alleviate these scarcity effects, the Eurosystem introduced the securities lending programme in April 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, the programme was initially only sparsely used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Only when the ECB introduced the cash-collateral option in December 2016, securities lending increased and contributed to lowering the dispersion of money market rates, thus supporting monetary policy transmission  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Just recently, the Eurosystem adjusted the pricing of the securities lending programme as of November 2020,  to reflect changes in euro area repo market conditions since December 2016 and to ensure that the Eurosystem securities lending facilities remain an effective backst  Liquidity placed by money market funds with banks also enter the formation of some money market rates, like the €STR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The rationale for expanding the purchases of non-financial commercial paper in the spring is explained in: de Guindos, L. and Schnabel, I.  , “The ECB’s commercial paper purchases: A targeted response to the economic disturbances caused by COVID-19”, ECB Blog, 3 April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">, “COVID-19 and the liquidity crisis of non-banks: lessons for the future”, on the liquidity crisis of non-banks in the spring of 2020, and what it implies for future regulatory reforms in the non-bank sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.66,0)">Commercial paper   rates are currently at low levels due to, inter alia, a renewed demand by investors and a reduced supply by bank issuers that obtained funding in the TLTROs.</span><span style="background-color:

importance of excess liquidity levels for money market functioning was exemplified by the repo market turmoil in the United States in September 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.49,0)">It was in part driven by declining levels of Fed excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.75,0)">Other drivers of the turmoil included regulation and bank internal risk management limits, as well as concentrated reserve holdings  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Despite the lack of contagion to the euro area in this episode, it is a relevant lesson to consider for future euro area monetary policy normalisation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">History can provide an interesting perspective and the paper by
