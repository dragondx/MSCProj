    <span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)"> Press briefing on new monetary and financial statistics Introductory remarks by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, for the presentation of four new/enhanced datasets on monetary and financial statistics, Frankfurt, 27 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to this press briefing on monetary and financial statistics, which is dedicated to the presentation of two new and two extended sets of statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">We are in an environment of continuous financial innovations and changes in the financial landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The ECB is determined to keep the monetary and financial statistics fit for use in that changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The extended sets of statistics improve the existing balance sheet and interest rate reporting by “monetary financial institutions”, which means primarily banks representing the money-issuing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These datasets are at the centre of our monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The new statistics refer to detailed quarterly balance sheet information from financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation, often called securitisation vehicles, and from insurance corporations and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The new datasets close some gaps in the harmonised balance sheet reporting of the growing sector of euro area financial intermediaries outside the money issuing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">These improvements and new developments are the result of very significant efforts undertaken by statisticians at the ECB and in the national central banks of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The work was carried out in close collaboration with policy-makers, analysts and the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In my view, this process brought about a proper balance between the benefits of the data for monetary policy and the burden of collecting it from respondents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As policy-makers, we need timely data, and the data must be harmonised across country borders, so that it can be readily aggregated at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The new statistics fit in well with the much used term “lessons learned from the financial crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, the new developments are the outcome of a process that has been pursued pro-actively and with a longer-term view, rather than re-actively and with a focus on the recent crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Indeed, the development process started before the financial turmoil that escalated into a genuine crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The process involved the euro area as well as other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It was motivated by the need to fill gaps caused by the ongoing financial innovation and by structural changes within financial products and the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The analysis forming the basis for monetary policy decisions depends crucially on the quality and breadth of coverage of the available statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Not least the frequently cited deficiencies of the Greek statistical system   have reminded us of the importance of reliable, accurate and timely statistics for the functioning and credibility of our whole system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">I am pleased that the new developments in monetary and financial statistics will contribute, in particular, to the research agenda of the ECB’s Governing Council for enhancing monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As you know, the ECB attaches a high importance to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Last year, we published a comprehensive scientific compendium on the enhancement of monetary analysis, and I presented these results at a press briefing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Allow me to mention three key examples to illustrate the improvements the new data bring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">First, the new data will shed more light into the relatively opaque shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A major aspect of financial innovation is linked to the securitisation of financial assets by, in particular, the banking sector, and to the financial vehicles created outside the banking sector for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The lack of good statistical information on securitisation gained increasing relevance over the last decade and became particularly obvious in the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In order to provide for a consistent monitoring of securitisation, the ECB has now introduced new quarterly balance sheet statistics that cover “financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The aggregated total assets of such special-purpose vehicles in the euro area stood at €2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This represents about one tenth of the total assets of all non-bank financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And together with the reporting of investment funds established in 2009, which also includes hedge funds, the ECB statistics now cover a large part of the shadow banking system within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition to balance sheet reporting for securitisation vehicles, a consistent monthly reporting by Monetary and Financial Institutions   has also been developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This makes it possible to assess how the securitisation of loans granted by MFIs can actually have an impact on the growth rates of MFI lending to households and non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">That is a step forward for our monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To give you a concrete example: taking into account the impact of securitisation, the annual growth of MFI loans to non-financial corporations turned positive already in October 2010, some months ahead of what had been shown by the figures available in the previous version of the statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Second, we now have detailed quarterly data on the balance sheet of insurance corporations and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Currently, their assets account for about one third of all assets of non-bank financial intermediaries within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">That is of course already a sizeable figure, but in view of our ageing societies, those institutions can be expected to be of further increasing significance for the economy and the entire financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Already today, insurance and pension fund technical reserves, which represent the claims that households have vis-à-vis life insurance companies and pension plans  , account for around 30% of households’ total financial wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">These new data therefore are important not only for the ECB, but will be highly relevant for many other uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Furthermore, as institutional investors with a significant portfolio in securities, insurance corporations and pension funds will be monitored for monetary policy and financial stability purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In view of the desirable further development of these statistics, we have started a close cooperation with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This should help to further improve the statistics, while minimising the costs for the industry through the compilation of aggregated data based on supervisory returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Third, the improved interest rate statistics allow a deeper analysis of the transmission channels of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">One specific improvement sheds more light on how the external financing conditions of small and medium-sized non-financial enterprises compare with those of large corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This is particularly relevant for the euro area, given its rather more bank-based funding system as compared with the more market-based funding system in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">For example, figures on interest rates for new loans to non-financial corporations show that interest rates on new loans of up to €250,000 have indeed been far higher than interest rates on loans of over €1 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">On average, they were more than 140 basis points higher for small and medium-sized enterprises and 90 basis points higher for sole proprietors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This is important information which enhances our analysis of the financing conditions as these rates serve as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to “sole proprietors”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Overall, I am pleased to see that these new developments and the new datasets in the euro area monetary and financial statistics keep them fit for policy and analysis purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Actually, we are coping well with the current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">In particular, not least due to the specific role we assign to money in our monetary policy strategy, I see a self-reinforcing virtuous circle in action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Enhancements in monetary and financial statistics make it possible to keep track of financial innovation, thereby facilitating an enhanced monetary analysis and thus ensuring an effective policy decision-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The enhanced monetary analysis and its use in the policy-making process, in turn, identify necessary improvements to the statistics, thereby closing the circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Nevertheless, there is no reason to be complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Important innovations in the financial sector will continue to occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">We thus need to invest in flexible tools and methods so as to further adapt our statistics and analysis to changes both in the financial sector and in its interaction with the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In this respect, a better international standardisation in the reporting and registration of individual financial products, transactions and financial institutions will be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The ECB is closely involved in discussions at the International Monetary Fund   and the Financial Stability Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Worldwide convergence and standardisation will allow a swift and flexible adaptation of monetary and financial statistics to financial innovation without creating an unnecessary reporting burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We need to express data requirements in a more business-friendly way and we should be open to automation   or supervisory reports).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Another potential for improvement lies in the re-use of micro-data, such as credit registers, for statistical purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The processes initiated within the framework of the G20 initiatives on data gaps might also provide an adequate forum for the very important and complex work ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Now, Aurel Schubert, the ECB’s Director General Statistics, will present more details on the four datasets and stand ready to answer your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">D. and Stark, J.  , Enhancing Monetary Analysis, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 2010.</span>
