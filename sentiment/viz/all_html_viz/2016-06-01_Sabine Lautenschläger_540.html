    <span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)"> European banking supervision – much achieved, but still much to do Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, Bundesbanksymposium "Dialogue on banking supervision",Frankfurt am Main, 1 June 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, In 1863 the Freemasons’ Tavern in London was the scene of a lively discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It concerned the adoption of a set of rules which was initially only valid in England and a good 20 years later was to become very important for the whole world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">The rules I’m referring to govern the world’s nicest trivial pursuit – and for once I’m not talking about banking – I’m talking about football.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Football is played the world over according to the same set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">Whether in South America or Europe, whether it’s the World Cup or at regional league level, the rules are the same worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.98,0)">Incidentally, at the outset it was the players themselves who policed the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.45,0)">Referees, as we know them today, didn’t appear until the end of the 19th century – the players’ self-regulation didn’t work out particularly well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Banking is perhaps not the world’s nicest trivial pursuit, but in some respects it is not unlike football.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.52,0)">Banks also compete with each other and have to stick to certain rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And these rules, too, are now largely harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Basel framework takes care of that at global level and the single rulebook at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And, of course, also in the banking sector there has to be someone who makes sure that everyone follows the rules – banks need a supervisor just as footballers need a referee, for self-regulation is a sub-optimal solution here too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We have had single European banking supervision in the euro area for over one-and-a-half years – here too there’s been a harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This process aims to regulate and supervise banks across the euro area according to uniformly high standards – and to prevent regulatory and supervisory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">That, in turn, is an essential basis for a stable banking sector that promotes growth and prosperity in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Much achieved...</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It was in this context that European banking supervision was established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Since November 2014 the ECB has supervised the now 129 biggest banking groups in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">However, this does not mean that there is only one referee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">European banking supervision consists not only of the ECB, but also of a total of 26 national central banks and supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And the national supervisors play an essential role in day-to-day supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">They make up the majority of the members of the teams supervising the large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.28,0)">Decisions are then taken by the Supervisory Board and the ECB’s Governing Council, in which the national supervisors are also represented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">European banking supervision thus means cooperation – a stable European banking system is a joint endeavour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It’s about supervising banks from a European perspective; it’s about combining experience and knowledge to spot risks at an earlier stage and to respond to them more rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It’s about preventing regulatory and supervisory arbitrage, and it’s about supervising in the same way, throughout the euro area, the same business and the same risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">By focusing on all these goals we have already achieved quite a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We have, for example, harmonised large parts of the supervisory cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">Together with the national supervisors we identify the main risks to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Building on this, we specify our supervisory priorities and transfer them to the supervisory programme for each bank, taking a uniform approach that is forward-looking, risk-oriented and proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Above all, we have harmonised the annual SREP – the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, the centrepiece of any form of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the SREP we analyse the business model, governance, the capital and liquidity risks for each institution, as well as the respective risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Using this as a basis, we then specify the capital and liquidity requirements for each institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Our advantage is not only that we can assess banks across the euro area on the basis of uniform criteria, but also that we are now in a position to compare banks with similar business models and to draw conclusions not only for individual banks, but also for whole banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Another example of harmonisation concerns the “options and discretions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The European regulatory framework contains a series of provisions which allow the respective supervisor to decide on their practical implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Together with the national supervisory authorities we have agreed to exercise these options and discretions in a uniform way throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">... but still much to do So, in the last one-and-a-half years, we have notched up some achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But there’s still a lot to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">One of our roles is to further develop the SREP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">We are working on improving our analysis of liquidity risks, risk management and liquidity adequacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We will harmonise our idea of how banks internally review their capital adequacy –ICAAP   is the key word.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This year, however, we still need to decide on other components of the SREP concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.06,0)">One question is whether, with regard to a bank’s capital position, we as supervisor should restrict ourselves solely to the formal and binding supervisory capital surcharge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Or would it make sense to express the supervisor’s expectation for a bank’s capital level as requirements on the one hand and as guidance on the other?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The requirement could then represent the formal, binding part of the supervisory expectations for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.07,0)">The supervisor could use the instrument of the requirement if immediate risks were not, or not adequately, covered or if there were serious shortcomings in a bank’s internal risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These capital requirements would then serve as the variable for the distribution of dividends, and so for the calculation of the maximum distributable amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">By contrast, the supervisor could mainly use the instrument of guidance when processing insights from hypothetical scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To this end, we would need, among other things, to transfer to the calculation of the supervisory guidance on capital those scenarios that we, in the last year SREP exercise, took into account in the binding capital surcharge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This adjustment to the SREP concept would not change the total capital level; it would just be divided differently between requirements and guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.18,0)">If a bank observed the binding capital requirements, but not the guidance, this should not automatically lead to a formal supervisory measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But that is enough about potential changes to the concept – as I said, the work is still ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let’s consider the small and medium-sized institutions: for them, the system of institutional protection schemes, for instance, plays an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In Germany, for instance, four out of five institutions belong to such a protection scheme – measured by balance sheet size, that’s around 40% of the German banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Under European law, banks gain privileges if they belong to a protection scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.01,0)">For example, institutions do not necessarily have to hold capital against exposures to members of the same protection scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.02,0)">The decision on whether to grant such a privilege is taken by the competent supervisor – in the case of small and medium-sized institutions, the national supervisors; in the case of large banks, the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So there is much to be said for harmonising supervisory expectations here too and for granting the privileges according to uniform criteria – both across countries and across institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I’d like to be clear about one thing, however: the aim is not to call into question the protection schemes in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The objective is to harmonise the supervisory treatment of the systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Ultimately, European banking supervision can only apply the principle of equal treatment as far as national banking regulation permits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.41,0)">As for national banking regulation, there are still a number of differences, some of them major, among the countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let’s compare it with football for a moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.31,0)">For the referee it would be difficult if he were in charge of a game in which each player played by different rules and in which there were some parts of the pitch, scattered around, where the rules were different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.6,0)">But this is exactly the situation European banking supervision is contending with at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.28,0)">One source of the regulatory differences is the CRD IV Directive which, as a European directive, has to be transposed into national law in the individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">And it wasn’t and won’t be as uniformly implemented as would be sensible for single supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">Let me mention just one example to give you an idea of these differences, which are often hard to understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The supervisor assesses whether candidates for the governing bodies of banks are professionally competent and reliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.96,0)">However, the corresponding rules are implemented in very different ways at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In some countries, for instance, it’s not only the candidates for the governing bodies who are evaluated but also those for key positions at the levels below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Some countries use questionnaires for the assessment and a range of detailed evaluation criteria, others don’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some countries interview the candidates, in part with the support of psychologists, others don’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.61,0)">Some countries don’t allow candidates to occupy their new post until the supervisory body has given its approval.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In other countries candidates can take up their new post even if the documents required for the assessment are not yet available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.55,0)">These differences create serious complications for European banking supervision and are an obstacle on the way to a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.19,0)">How can it be that the executive board members of a globally active bank in one particular country have to have different skills, knowledge and experience from their counterparts in another country?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Here too, further harmonisation of the relevant rules would be useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.11,0)">National rules which are not expressly mentioned in the CRD IV are a further cause of regulatory fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">They include rules governing the acquisition of shareholdings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.52,0)">Some countries require major transactions to be supervised in advance by the national authorities, other countries don’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Here too, it would make sense to further harmonise the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">We can thus conclude European banking supervision has helped to further harmonise the supervisory framework in the past 18 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Much has been achieved, but there is still much to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Limits of harmonisation Ladies and gentlemen, harmonisation is not an end in itself but important for financial stability and sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">But how far must harmonisation go?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let’s consider football again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Yes, the rules are largely harmonised, but that doesn’t mean the referee punishes every misdemeanour straightaway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.05,0)">In the penalty area a serious foul results in a penalty kick, and outside that area a free kick.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.9,0)">The reason: a foul in the penalty area, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.23,0)">near the goal, has a greater effect on the game than a foul in midfield.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.75,0)">At the same time, the rules in professional leagues and in major competitions are stricter – consider the fourth official or goal-line technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The rules and the refereeing of football thus follow the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And in the banking sector the proportionality of regulation and supervision may be even more relevant than in football.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First and foremost, the rules of football should allow fair and orderly play; in the banking sector, it is also and above all about stability – the stability of the banking system and ultimately of the whole economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And here the fact that multiple and diverse players are on the pitch is important: large banks, small banks, regional institutions and cross-border ones, banks with risky business models and banks with low-risk models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As all these banks are relevant to the stability of the system in different ways, the benefits of strict regulation and supervision also differ widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.77,0)">The costs incurred by individual banks as a result of regulation and supervision also vary, particularly the operational costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For smaller banks, these costs, relatively speaking, are higher – unlike larger banks they cannot benefit from economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.67,0)">At the same time, disproportionately high regulatory and supervisory costs represent a barrier for new competitors entering the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So there is something to be said for regulating and supervising banks according to the proportionality principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Here, harmonisation comes up against a boundary which is both reasonable and necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.11,0)">In public discussions proportionality is often tied to the size of the institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.11,0)">This makes the discussion easier, but it can also lead in the wrong direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The decisive factor should be the bank’s systemic importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.13,0)">And at the latest since the savings and loans crisis in the United States in the 1980s, we know that even small banks may still be systemically relevant – “too many to fail” is as big a problem as “too big to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The wording of the legal basis of European banking supervision with regard to proportionality is correspondingly broad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It reads as follows: “When carrying out the tasks conferred on it, and without prejudice to the objective to ensure the safety and soundness of credit institutions, the ECB should have full regard to the diversity of credit institutions and their size and business models”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">In European banking supervision, proportionality is clear to see: while the 129 biggest banks in the euro area are directly supervised by the ECB, the smaller institutions, some 3,200 of them, are overseen by the national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.84,0)">Only in specific cases and under certain conditions does the ECB directly supervise smaller institutions – and in such cases the question may be asked whether that is appropriate at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.09,0)">Normally, the ECB only plays a secondary role in the supervision of smaller institutions – its task is to be in the background supporting national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">So we are developing, together with national supervisors, high-quality standards which take account of regional factors, size, business and risk of the individual institutions, and are correspondingly adaptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">This kind of harmonisation does not aim to be a levelling-down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is not a question of replacing national supervisory approaches by a European one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">On the contrary, we ensure that the key elements of the supervision attain certain minimum standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Then national specificities can be taken into account, but only if they are justified from a risk perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The principle of proportionality also takes us into areas which go beyond the general supervisory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And I would like to take the opportunity to clear up a widespread misunderstanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.22,0)">Again and again, people tell me that the ECB is imposing who knows how many reporting obligations on small and medium-sized institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Let me give just two examples that show that when it comes to reporting we certainly work in line with the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">Under the European regulation, supervisors may require the banks to use the International Financial Reporting Standards for supervisory reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We have chosen not to exercise this option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.44,0)">It would have imposed a disproportionate burden on those banks that draw up their balance sheets according to national standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Banks may therefore continue to use national standards for their supervisory reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Accordingly, the reporting requirements are quite precisely tailored to, among other things, the size of the institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In anticipation of future reporting requirements, we asked the national supervisors last year, for the first time ever, to provide us with supervisory data on all small and medium-sized banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">They were asked to submit 37 separate data points, including the balance sheet total, the level of customer deposits or the trading book portfolio – so nothing complex at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.73,0)">By contrast, the banks that are directly supervised by the ECB are asked to give more than 8,000 data points – and these have to be submitted not annually but quarterly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And one last example: the supervisory fees are also based on the principle of proportionality, rightly taking into account the significance, the size and riskiness of the respective institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Of this year’s fees, around 88% are allotted to the 129 institutions directly supervised by the ECB, 12% to 3,200 smaller banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, harmonising banking regulation and supervision in Europe plays a key role in ensuring the stability of the banking sector and in providing the basis for prosperity and growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">With regard to the banking sector, we have in the last year-and-a-half come a long way, but there is still much to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.44,0)">In view of the increasing harmonisation of regulation and supervision their proportionality is a recurring issue, not least because the complexity of regulation has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Again, it’s always being said that smaller banks above all are bearing a disproportionate burden; and again, a reduction of these burdens is always being called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This discussion is important, but it must be conducted in a discerning way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, regulation and supervision already follow the principle of proportionality – I have given some examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.1,0)">Second, the complexity of regulation and supervision is not least due to the increasing complexity of the banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.99,0)">And third, the principle of proportionality must not be used as a pretext for generally weakening regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The basis of the discussion must always be the cost-effectiveness of regulation and supervision – proportionality must not come at the expense of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As I said earlier, there was a heated discussion in the Freemasons’ Tavern too about an important set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">What started in 1863 in London will again be in the spotlight as of 10 June, for that’s when the Euro 2016 championship starts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As a professional European I naturally have no favourites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">I look forward to a fair competition, and may the best team win.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But if it happens to be Germany, I wouldn’t complain.</span>
