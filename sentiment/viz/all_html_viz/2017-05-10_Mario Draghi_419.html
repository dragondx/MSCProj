    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> Introductory remarks at the House of Representatives of the Netherlands Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal, The Hague, 10 May 2017 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of Parliament, This year, we celebrate the 60th and 25th anniversaries of the Treaties of Rome and Maastricht.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Despite the many challenges that we face as Europeans, we should never forget the significant achievements of European integration in providing peace, security and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The fact that the Treaty that gave birth to the euro was signed in this country symbolises the enduring role of the Netherlands at the forefront of this European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I am therefore honoured to be invited to speak here at the Dutch Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Today’s event offers an opportunity to provide insight into the ECB’s decisions and to listen to your views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">It is indeed important for the ECB to reach out to euro area citizens and their representatives to explain how we fulfil our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The EU Treaties democratically conferred upon the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This objective binds my colleagues and me on the ECB’s Governing Council, where our decisions are the result of collegial debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And we are held accountable for our decisions by all EU citizens through their representatives in the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my remarks today, I would like to expand on three points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, I want to show how a very severe double dip crisis required the ECB to deploy unconventional instruments to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And our measures are proving effective: incoming data confirm that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly solid and that downside risks have further diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, I will discuss the possible side effects of these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.45,0)">I will consider the different dimensions in which our monetary policy affects people’s finances and welfare, which are sometimes overlooked in the current debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Finally, I will outline why the ECB cannot be the only actor contributing to the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Other economic, financial and fiscal policies are essential to ensure a sustained recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Recovering from the crisis: the role of monetary policy Let me start by recalling where we came from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.27,0)">The Great Recession, as it is called, resulted in a protracted period of low inflation and low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.75,0)">Specifically, the euro area faced two interlinked and successive crises – a financial crisis in 2008 and a sovereign debt crisis that started to emerge in 2011 and derailed the rebound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.47,0)">The recovery that began in mid-2013 lost steam in the summer of 2014 as the external environment became more uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.68,0)">At the beginning of 2014, credit growth was contracting at an annual pace of more than 3%, while overall economic growth was stalling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">Since the start of 2013, inflation had drifted consistently away from the ECB’s target rate of below but close to 2% over the medium term, reaching levels below 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.17,0)">Without counteracting measures, this low inflation could have turned into a deflationary spiral which would have deepened our economies’ woes considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">It was against this macroeconomic background that the ECB took decisive policy action to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole, in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.59,0)">In normal times, when inflation is above target, central banks raise the key interest rates to rein it in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.11,0)">When inflation is below target, they lower the key interest rates to stimulate economic activity and induce an increase in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.63,0)">However, at the start of 2014, the deposit facility rate had already been brought to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.97,0)">At the same time, financial fragmentation in the euro area was hampering the transmission of our policy, as our monetary policy impulses were not evenly transmitted across countries or adequately along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">So in order to provide additional monetary accommodation and to support the recovery in credit, the ECB used a range of non-standard measures to meet its inflation objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.71,0)">These include a negative deposit facility rate, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, forward guidance and asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Net asset purchases currently amount to €60 billion per month, and are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">These measures aim to influence short and longer-term interest rates, asset prices and loan volumes, thereby fostering economic growth and supporting price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB’s actions were not unique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.57,0)">Central banks in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom also used asset purchases, while central banks in for example Sweden and Switzerland reduced key interest rates to below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Our measures have been very effective: they have led to very favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.95,0)">Since mid-2014, bank lending rates for both firms and households have dropped by more than 100 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And we have witnessed a pronounced convergence in borrowing conditions across both euro area countries and types of borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">These favourable financing conditions have in turn supported the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">For 15 consecutive quarters, euro area quarterly GDP growth has been consistently between 0.3% and 0.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In 2016, GDP per capita grew faster in the euro area than in any other major advanced economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.12,0)">Four and a half million jobs were created in the last three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.84,0)">And unemployment in the euro area is at its lowest point since May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our monetary policy has successfully stabilised inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.81,0)">In our March ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised upwards significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while remaining unchanged for 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.14,0)">These projections foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Similar to what we have observed at the euro area level, the economic expansion in the Netherlands has also strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">GDP grew at 2.2% in 2016, driven by strong domestic demand on account of improving business and consumer confidence and positive wealth and real-income effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">In addition, unemployment has steadily decreased, registering at 5.1% in March 2017, and the Netherlands has more jobs than before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Supported by low interest rates and a strengthening recovery, the Dutch government ran a 2.9 billion euro surplus last year, its first surplus since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And, as an export-oriented country, the Netherlands is currently benefiting from the recovery in other euro area countries, especially as growth in global trade remains tepid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.52,0)">The side effects of our policies I am aware that these very accommodative financing conditions have raised various concerns, also in this House.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.22,0)">Monetary policy measures always have side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">So far, the potential negative side effects have been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We are monitoring these various effects carefully, taking into account our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">To ascertain the overall impact of our measures on citizens, it is important to differentiate between the various ways in which they affect economic actors, such as households, pension funds and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me start with households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.38,0)">An accommodative monetary policy means households accrue fewer nominal returns on their savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, an accommodative policy supports the economic recovery, which in turn bolsters employment, income, returns on investment and tax revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">It therefore benefits households in their capacity as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, borrowers and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.15,0)">Similarly, there are several channels through which our policies affect pension systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Yes, lower rates increase the present value of future liabilities of pension schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.63,0)">However, the liability side of pension schemes is only one part of the equation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What happens on the asset side is also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And our monetary policy has had a beneficial impact on this side of the equation as the value of the investment portfolio has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Also, let’s not forget that our monetary policy supports pension systems indirectly by supporting employment growth and thus pension contributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">In any case, it is ultimately up to sound governance structures and long-term strategies to ensure the financial health of pension systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Equally, monetary policy can have an impact on bank profitability through various channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Our assessment is that so far these effects tend to largely offset each other in aggregate terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.27,0)">Low rates might reduce bank profits through the narrowing of net interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Yet, at the same time, by supporting the recovery, accommodative monetary policy reduces delinquencies and defaults, including on mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Improved credit quality coupled with higher lending volumes and an improved market value of assets supports bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.99,0)">Of course, depending on the strength of their balance sheet, some banks may be more affected than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.24,0)">Also banks facing structurally high cost-to-income ratios or limited diversification of income sources might have to revamp their business models regardless of the low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">Finally, let me also address the risks of overheating in some parts of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.27,0)">We do not currently see compelling evidence of overstretched asset valuations at the euro area level, but we do see that real estate dynamics or high household debt levels in some countries signal the risk of increasing imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.68,0)">Such risks also exist in the Netherlands: they relate to the continued very high level of household indebtedness and the low level of mortgage collateralisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">For this reason, we share the concerns expressed in the warning issued by the European Systemic Risk Board in November 2016 and recognise that there is a case for mitigating measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.02,0)">That being said, monetary policy is not the appropriate tool for addressing local and sectoral financial risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Rather, targeted macroprudential policies, which can be tailored to local and sectoral conditions, are the right answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The way forward Against the backdrop of a recovery that is becoming increasingly solid, the benefits of our policy clearly outweigh potential side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Also due to the pass-through of our monetary policy, there is now more and more evidence that economic growth is firming and broadening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Incoming data confirm that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly solid and that downside risks have further diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is too early to declare success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued and have yet to show a convincing upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.4,0)">The domestic drivers of inflation, namely wages, are not yet responding to the recovery and the narrowing output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Maintaining the current very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">However, beyond the contribution of monetary policy, we also need measures to address the legacy of the crisis, lift potential growth and upgrade our economic ecosystem to increase resilience to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.19,0)">This requires action at the Member State level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Ambitious, country-specific, structural reforms are needed to raise productivity, make economies more resilient, and address persistent fragilities, including those inherited from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">And Member States need to pursue prudent fiscal policies to build up buffers for difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">National parliaments can play a central role in supporting such efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Our accommodative monetary policy provides a window of opportunity for pursuing such policies, for example by alleviating some of the short-run costs of structural reforms and allowing their benefits to materialise faster .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">Action at the European level is also required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.81,0)">The crisis has revealed significant fragilities not only at Member State level, but also in the economic governance of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Some of the fragilities could be addressed already by applying the common rules we have all agreed on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Others, however, need to be addressed by upgrading our governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">How?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Banking union needs to be completed by making parallel progress on risk reduction and risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This includes adopting the European Commission’s risk reduction package which, among other things, implements some of the remaining Basel III reforms and further strengthens prudential rules in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">At the same time, we need to establish a European deposit insurance scheme and a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Ambitious progress towards a fully fledged capital markets union would also create more effective channels of private risk sharing in the euro area and reduce the need for fiscal stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The Five Presidents’ Report  also emphasises the need to strengthen our union from an economic, fiscal and legitimacy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And in a world tempted by protectionism and ring-fencing, completing Economic and Monetary Union is perhaps more urgent than ever before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Conclusion Allow me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The euro area has certainly faced its fair share of challenges in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">But things are clearly improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In the euro area, the economic recovery has evolved from being fragile and uneven into a firming, broad-based upswing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy measures have been supporting this recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We have established four criteria to confirm a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our definition of price stability in the medium term that would warrant a scaling-back of the current degree of monetary policy accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">First, that headline inflation is on a path to levels below, but close to 2% over a meaningful medium-term horizon; second, that inflation will be durable and stabilise around those levels with sufficient confidence; third, that inflation will be self-sustained, meaning it will maintain its trajectory even with diminishing support from monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And finally, the relevant metric in each case is euro area inflation, not the inflation rates of any individual country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, in order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This depends on the policies pursued by Member States, where national parliaments have a key role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">But it also depends on our collective ability to further strengthen the architecture of Economic and Monetary Union in a way that fully reflects the interdependence among the euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Pursuing such policies will ensure a higher growth trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am now at your disposal for questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The Five Presidents’ Report: Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union</span>
