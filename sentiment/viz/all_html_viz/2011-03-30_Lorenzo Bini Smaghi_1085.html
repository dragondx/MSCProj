    <span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)"> Banking supervision and corporate governance in the European architecture Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Closing Seminar “Banking Supervision and Internal Audit as Contributors to Sound Corporate Governance and Financial Stability”Moscow, 30 March 2011 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to you on this occasion here in Moscow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The Cooperation Programme that ends today has been very successful in two important fields for central banks: banking supervision and internal audit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.86,0)">Looking back at this venture, we can see that three unusual, eventful years have passed since 1 April 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.88,0)">The macroeconomic, financial, and also political environments in the euro area and around the globe have been in a state of flux, and sometimes in turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.07,0)">Likewise we all have been moved and saddened by natural disasters and human error, by acts of war and acts of terror.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">At the same time, these three years have also seen remarkably positive events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The Central Bank of the Russian Federation celebrated its 150th anniversary last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It steered its way successfully through the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Bank of Russia became a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and of the Financial Stability Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The European Central Bank, meanwhile, marked the tenth anniversary of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It became an EU institution as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And the EU Commission here in Russia has also had a change of status: it is now the EU Delegation to the Russian Federation and is part of the European External Action Service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">As I just said, banking supervision and internal audit have been the focus of work here these past three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">A three-way partnership was formed, consisting of the EU Delegation, the Bank of Russia and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">The Eurosystem acted through the ECB and eight national central banks: the Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque de France, Banca d’Italia, Banco de España, De Nederlandsche Bank, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Bank of Greece and Suomen Pankki/Finlands Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.14,0)">Central bank cooperation in challenging times calls for resolute action The coming years are likely to be just as challenging as recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Central banks will be required to act as anchors of monetary and financial stability in a rapidly changing world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The Eurosystem central banks are cooperating in banking supervision, financial stability, internal audit and in many other fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In addition to the Programme here in Russia, a Eurosystem programme on Basel II is under way involving the Central Bank of Egypt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A crisis response package covering banking supervision and financial crisis management is being conducted with south-eastern European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">And technical assistance is being given to a number of would-be EU members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Europe strengthens its institutional framework for financial stability Generally, Europe has responded to the challenges of the past few years in a structured and thoughtful way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The creation of the European Systemic Risk Board   broadens the scope of cooperation and institutional awareness in respect of macroprudential oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB is the supporting institution and provides, inter alia, analytical and statistical inputs to the ESRB structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The Risk Board enables European regulators and supervisors to complement the microprudential perspective with a systematic monitoring and assessment of potential dangers to the stability of the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The discipline of macroprudential supervision combines the information and assessments obtained via microprudential supervision with macroeconomic and monetary insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We expect macroprudential measures, such as countercyclical provisioning, to mitigate systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We also expect the findings of macroprudential oversight to feed into the microprudential work that alerts supervisors and the wider world to macroeconomic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Besides setting up the ESRB, on 1 January this year, three European Supervisory Authorities   came into being: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We expect that these new institutions will sustainably enhance microprudential supervision in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.52,0)">Currently, the EU and euro area financial system continue to face several important risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.23,0)">The main source of concern is the interplay between fiscal imbalances, downside risks to economic growth and bank funding vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Although this interplay is limited to a small number of euro area countries, with a relatively small share of total EU and euro area GDP, potential contagion to other EU or euro area countries is not insignificant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this respect, let me state how surprised I am to see how quickly some of the lessons of the crisis are being forgotten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">One of the lessons is the need to assess risk in a systemic way, not only at the micro level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There can be no systemic assessment without taking contagion into account, across instruments, across markets and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.17,0)">The sub-prime crisis or the collapse of Lehman have clearly shown how devastating contagion can be!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.0,0)">It is thus all the more surprising to see how in the current environment some policy makers, academics or editorialists totally ignore the systemic dimension of financial markets in their proposals for very specific issues like for instance bank debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.44,0)">Thinking that a specific category of assets - such as senior bank bonds - can be treated in a specific way without immediately affecting all other assets, or that certain banks can be treated in a way that does not impact the whole system, not only within a country but also cross border is a testimony of short memory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The same applies for sovereign debt instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.69,0)">The risks related to the re-emergence of global imbalances and any disorderly unwinding are also considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Moreover, the catastrophe in Japan and tensions in the Middle East show us that risks of various sorts   are never far away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In addition, a new round of stress tests is being carried out between March and June this year, with the final set of results to be published in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.04,0)">There have been many comments and discussions about these stress tests, often without sufficient information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">There is no doubt that the success of these tests depends on their full understanding on the parts of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is thus essential that supervisory authorities coordinate closely within the EBA their communication strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.46,0)">It’s no time for cacophony, nor for national authorities to engage in a beauty contest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.48,0)">Compared to the previous round, the underlying scenarios are considerably more adverse, in particular in terms of overall decline in GDP which encompasses the sum of all the parameter changes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.58,0)">The probability of the scenario is, over a two year horizon, much lower, especially for 2011 where it is 1%, instead of 7% last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.31,0)">Moreover, national supervisors and banks will have less discretion in conducting the tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This time the EBA will be giving direct guidance regarding the definition and projections of pre-provision operating profits, including the increased cost of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The thresholds in the stress tests will be set at levels which are substantially higher than the minimum solvency requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Banking regulation is becoming stricter In a broader sense, Europe has been actively contributing to stronger prudential supervision, notably banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">At both global and national levels, there has been a marked tightening of banking and prudential rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Work on corporate governance and internal audit has progressed too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.13,0)">In light of the financial crisis experienced in advanced economies, it could fairly be asked whether the rules are to be blamed or the way in which they were applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The answer to this question is pertinent also for this cooperation Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In fact, it was decided that work foreseen in the Programme concerning the implementation of the Basel II framework should continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Basel II focuses on risk-based supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">It requires banks to operate a structured risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The internal capital adequacy assessment process   required by pillar 2 is a model for systematic strategic planning for any financial enterprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Financial firms must have an understanding of their risk and capital situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are required to have a continual review of their risks, capital and business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">I think that they will flourish only if they embrace in their corporate processes and culture the continual learning paradigm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This focus on the systematic management of a financial institution has been repeatedly stressed in both parts of the Cooperation Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Rightly so: the soundness of a financial firm depends on its own managers’ capability to understand, measure and master the risks, and to grasp the business opportunities on the basis of a good control of the downside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">That capability constitutes its first line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.73,0)">Supervision can only be the second line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Internal audit is an essential part of corporate governance The internal audit part of the Cooperation Programme has focused on risk-based audit and IT audit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The audit function is oriented towards the organisation’s objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Internal audit delivers independent views and advice on the governance of the organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A comprehensive and systematic view of the risks posed to the objectives and the organisation as a whole guide the auditors in the planning of their work as well as in the follow-up to their recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">As IT is nowadays an intrinsic part of the infrastructure as well as a critical business tool, the Programme’s focus on the particular challenges of the IT audit was certainly appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Overall, the Programme emphasised risk orientation rather than compliance checks, an approach that is indispensable today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Only an audit function that understands the dynamics of the changing environment and the impact of these changes on the organisation’s objectives can provide the necessary reassurance to the organisation’s top management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The Programme has contributed to such a risk orientation – which has meant a considerable cultural change for the audit function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I think that risk-based audits need two key ingredients for success: firstly, chief auditors must enjoy the full trust and backing of the organisation’s top management, even when they convey unpleasant or unwelcome messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">And secondly, the auditors can only do their job properly if they are empowered to act autonomously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Central bank cooperation – a long-term investment that will bear fruit I have sought today to shed some light on the importance of various tools for the soundness of our financial systems: banking supervision, internal audit, micro and macroprudential supervision as well as audit and corporate governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The ‘investment’ that this Programme has made in banking supervision, as society’s ‘systemic financial risk management’, and in internal audit, as an element to help an organisation achieve its objectives, is fully in line with this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I am confident that the investment will bear fruit in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Finally, let me thank all those involved in this project – the EU Delegation, the Bank of Russia and also the colleagues from the eight national central banks and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">It’s the close cooperation in these uncertain times which has made this remarkable project so successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I sense that, although we are concluding this particular venture, the challenges of the future and the very positive experience of this Programme will certainly justify new partnerships in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">I sense that there is no shortage of interest and enthusiasm to join forces again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Many thanks to all those who contributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">And thank you for your attention.</span>
