    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.68,0)"> “Europe after the warm reboot” Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Munich Seminars, Ifo Institute for Economic Research, University of Munich, 13 January 2014 Professor Sinn, Ladies and gentlemen, Almost 25 years have now past since the Berlin Wall came down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.52,0)">The fall of the Wall symbolised the collapse of the entire Eastern Bloc and the economic model in place there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.18,0)">The former “socialist” countries subsequently had to start from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Gerlinde and Hans-Werner Sinn described the revitalisation of eastern Germany’s economy very fittingly when they chose “ Kaltstart”   as the title of their book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.26,0)">Europe, too, came under immense pressure to take action as a result of the financial and government debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The case of the euro area, however, did not, and does not, call for a start from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Nonetheless, extensive stabilisation measures, as well as both structural and institutional reforms, were necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Europe’s “warm reboot” took place almost four years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">That makes this a good opportunity to take stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.37,0)">Where does Europe stand today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.47,0)">What challenges lie ahead?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.48,0)">That is what I would like to do here tonight, looking at the following three questions: First, what has occurred at the institutional level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, what can we make of the adjustments that have taken place in the Member States?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.37,0)">Third, what challenges do we still have to face?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">A more stable institutional framework at the European level A stable monetary union calls for more than just a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.61,0)">The crisis has brought the weaknesses of the Maastricht Treaty painfully to light.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.56,0)">First of all, the Member States failed to comply fully with agreed rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.25,0)">For example, most of the euro area countries, starting with the largest ones, repeatedly breached the deficit ceilings set by the Stability and Growth Pact – and the community of sinners put up with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.76,0)">Second, too little attention was paid to emerging macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.06,0)">Third, expectations that the financial markets would ensure budgetary discipline on the part of Member States were sorely disappointed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">Fourth, there was no institution in place that could intervene to stabilise the situation in a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The crisis has caused all these weaknesses to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Both the institutional framework and the set of rules have been improved significantly: the Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened through the adoption of the Fiscal Compact and what is known as the Six-pack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We now have a procedure in place for the early recognition and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism   has given us an effective crisis management body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.13,0)">In the past, requirements alone proved incapable of satisfactorily resolving the problem of inadequate budgetary discipline because the Community tacitly accepted such breaches of the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.15,0)">That is why the new economic policy governance framework provides for quasi-automatic sanctions in the event of a Member State deviating from agreed benchmarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">*** It is not only the set of rules that has been improved and strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">A consensus was also reached on the need for a monetary union to be more highly integrated than a common market of independent states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.3,0)">The crisis has shown that wrong decisions on the part of individual Member States can have an impact on the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This has caused the President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, together with the Presidents of the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB, to propose putting in place the four elements of a true economic and monetary union: such a union should include not only a fiscal union and an economic union, but also a banking and political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.17,0)">We are currently working hard to get a banking union off the ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The goal of the envisaged banking union is to create a fully integrated, efficient and stable European financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Key to attaining that goal is an integrated banking market that will intensify competition for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">That will result in a more efficient allocation of capital, thereby improving the financing conditions for enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The enterprises, in turn, thereby gain the necessary financial leeway for investment that could have a favourable impact on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">For us as a central bank, an integrated banking sector means, above all, that our monetary policy is fully effective throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is the only way in which our monetary policy can have a proper impact on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Once the banking union and its two key elements – joint banking supervision and a joint bank resolution mechanism – are in place, they will help cut the close ties between bank and sovereign risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.0,0)">Structural adjustment in the euro area While the euro area has been busy with the reform of its institutional framework, macroeconomic imbalances there have diminished considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This is reflected, no least, in the improved current account balances of countries that were hit particularly hard by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Taken together, those countries already recorded a small current account surplus back in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">There is reason to assume that the underlying adjustments have largely been structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.07,0)">Put simply, current account deficits can be reduced through two channels: either domestic demand falls in comparison with external demand  , or there is a decline in the real effective exchange rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.98,0)">Prior to the crisis, there were some euro area countries that had a current account deficit and, at the same time, consumed more than they were producing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Typically, an economy will again record a current account balance that is in line with economic fundamentals, and will be able to exploit its production potential in full, when both overall domestic demand and real exchange rates decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.58,0)">Prices often adjust only slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.18,0)">Moreover, in a monetary union, the countries involved cannot change the nominal exchange rate of their currency unilaterally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Any short-term adjustment of the current account thus takes place via the demand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.55,0)">That has unpleasant side-effects: actual production falls below the production potential, meaning that the country concerned has a negative output gap, and unemployment rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.05,0)">In order to bring the internal and external balances back into line with one another, it is essential that the real effective exchange rate is reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This form of internal adjustment makes domestic products more attractive and fosters economic growth by way of higher net exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It also means that a stronger focus on internationally tradable goods and services results in adjustment that is more conducive to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.96,0)">The improvements in the current account balances of the “crisis countries” have indeed been due to a mix of declining domestic demand and real depreciation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.91,0)">Initially in the foreground in these countries was a painful decline in demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In the meantime, however, the Member States concerned are gradually becoming more competitive again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.74,0)">In Spain, for instance, the real effective exchange rate has fallen by almost 15% since the fourth quarter of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The country has climbed from 42nd to 35th place on the World Economic Forum’s global ranking of countries’ competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since 2011, Portugal’s share of exports in GDP has increased by 11 percentage points, while that of Spain has risen by 8 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In Ireland, the share of exports in GDP has increased by around 25 percentage points since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.65,0)">It was only initially that Ireland’s imports declined slightly – they are now already higher than the level prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These developments show that adjustment is indeed possible, even within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But just how sustainable are these adjustments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.43,0)">Might they not be merely short-term developments due to the weakness of business activity in the countries concerned?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The improvements in the current accounts of the crisis countries are primarily structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.2,0)">What is involved is thus not an only temporary drop in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">That is why, viewed from today’s perspective, we regard the improvements to be sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.2,0)">Although the current account positions of the crisis countries could again change slightly once output there is back into line with the production potential, it is unlikely that the adjustments recorded to date will be reversed in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Better current account balances do not mean, however, that the crisis has been overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.83,0)">And it certainly does not mean that there is nothing left to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.96,0)">The level of unemployment, especially that of young people, is depressingly high in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This calls for further structural reforms, although some progress has already been made in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The OECD   has found that the labour markets in Portugal, Spain and Greece are now more flexible than those in the so-called “core countries”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In Greece, for instance, far-reaching labour market reforms have significantly reduced the cost of labour, and have thus improved the country’s price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.99,0)">Since 2009, labour costs there have fallen by some 18%, with wage and salary adjustments the main driver of developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.84,0)">Specifically, compensation per employee has decreased by around 20% over the period in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Labour market reforms can also strengthen the growth potential and increase prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">That can, of course, also lead to higher demand for imported goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, however, improved labour market fundamentals ensure that the countries concerned become more competitive again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">That, in turn, can help prevent current account deficits from rising excessively once economic activity in these countries regains proper momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">It is precisely in this area – in the still very tentative economic recovery – that I see the greatest challenge to be faced this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Europe’s political leaders have learnt from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">They have strengthened the institutional framework and have set a deepening of European integration in motion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">And Member States are becoming more and more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.06,0)">However, the economic recovery in Europe continues to be rather fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The challenge: productive investment for more growth Lastingly overcoming the crisis demands a return to sustainable economic growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">That calls for productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.69,0)">Since the beginning of 2008, the main reason for declining growth has been the lack of investment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Even the slight recovery in economic activity between 2009 and 2011 saw an only barely discernible increase in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">Although it is quite normal for investment levels to vary, the decline in investment over the past five years was perceptibly sharper and continued far longer than in any recession in the euro area in the past 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.94,0)">Why is the investment ratio currently so low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.8,0)">Some businesses have reduced their investment because their sales and earnings prospects are muted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.93,0)">The macroeconomic environment is occasionally bleak and some sectors are in the midst of restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.32,0)">All this makes planning increasingly uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.74,0)">Other businesses regard further investment as unnecessary because they have adequate spare production capacity at their disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.92,0)">Both banks and businesses need to reduce their, in some cases, excessive debt and are shrinking their balance sheets accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.96,0)">That, too, reduces investment activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.2,0)">Some enterprises simply lack the funds they need for investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.97,0)">Their possibilities for obtaining financing are inadequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.54,0)">These are all cyclical phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.26,0)">Apart from them, structural changes may result in lower investment at home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.86,0)">Examples in this respect are ageing societies with poor macroeconomic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.51,0)">In addition, the trend towards an outsourcing of production is also leaving its mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.4,0)">And finally, consumption patterns are changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.04,0)">For instance, the importance of cars as status symbol is on the decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">*** Although by far most investment is undertaken by enterprises, the political domain determines the fundamentals that create a favourable climate for investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.44,0)">Even enterprises that can actually afford to spend money tend to limit their investment in times of political and economic uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Moreover, public sector investment in key areas such as education and infrastructure add to the attractiveness of an economic location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Such investment improves conditions for production, and thus also attracts new private sector investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In times marked by consolidation and the reduction of debt levels, however, this cannot be taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">That is why it is all the more important, first, that those countries that have the financial leeway necessary for investment keep an eye on infrastructure needs and, second, that regulatory bodies do not raise barriers against, in particular, long-term investment projects undertaken by public and private sector partnerships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.21,0)">In Europe, political and economic uncertainty has already diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The currently more stable macroeconomic environment there probably also owes something to the policy pursued by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">We at the ECB will continue to do whatever we can within the scope of our mandate to eliminate any uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Where monetary policy is concerned, this includes the reaffirmation by the Governing Council of its forward guidance, through which the planning security of market participants was increased by indicating that we continue to believe that the ECB’s policy interest rates will remain at their current or a lower level for a longer period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">With respect to the forthcoming assessment of the balance sheets or stress tests of the most significant banks in the euro area, we intend to publish details of the methodology at the end of this month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It remains a task of the political domain to further reform the labour markets, to consolidate the public sector budgets in a sustainable manner, to make the judiciary more efficient and to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.33,0)">Complex and partially unclear insolvency proceedings may, for instance, have the effect of deterring investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In this respect, I certainly see room for improvement: in addition to greater transparency, out-of-court settlements should also be provided for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Moreover, I would regard early-warning systems and a speedier conclusion of judicial proceedings as feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">All this can contribute to making a location more attractive to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">In order to ensure that the recovery of investment activity subsequently gains proper momentum, it is essential that enterprises have adequate financing at their disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.85,0)">In times marked by fragmented European financial markets, this is not always easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.21,0)">Bottlenecks in obtaining financing are an issue for small and medium-sized enterprises  , in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And such enterprises play an important role in Europe’s economy: 99.7% of all European enterprises fall into this category.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.49,0)">They account for around 60% of all jobs in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Given the economic importance of SMEs in the euro area, their provision with adequate financing is a key element of ensuring a sustainable recovery of economic activity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These small and medium-sized enterprises obtain most of their financing from the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.76,0)">Direct access to the capital market is rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">That is why it is vital for the European banking sector to be restored to health.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Only if this is done will banks again be able to pursue their core business and provide the real economy with credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The establishment of a banking union will contribute to making the banking sector more sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In preparation of the single supervisory mechanism, we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of the most significant banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.34,0)">In the event of our revealing weaknesses in this exercise, the banks concerned will have to take measures to correct them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Banks with sound business models, which will be supervised on the basis of harmonised European requirements, should be capable of providing the real economy with loans for productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The fact that European banks are increasingly again gaining access to the international capital markets is a good sign in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The banking union is aimed at the establishment of a single European capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">It marks the attempt to re-integrate the fragmented European market more closely again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">If that proves to be successful, enterprises will be able to raise a loan from a bank in a neighbouring country, rather than from its home country bank, whenever better terms and conditions offered there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Enterprises would then again be assessed in terms of the creditworthiness, rather than – as is currently the case – on the basis of their location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">A healthy, integrated banking sector is thus of significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In addition, however, alternative sources of financing should be considered as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.69,0)">For smaller enterprises in particular, it is usually difficult to raise capital directly on the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.89,0)">This is due, inter alia, to the fact that their financial situation is generally less transparent than that of larger corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.89,0)">That makes it difficult or more costly for investors to obtain adequate information for reasoned investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A single database with information of the credit risk of SMEs would reduce the transaction costs of both investors and the enterprises themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">Such a database might also contain other information provided on a voluntary basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In those countries in which this has not already been done, the national central banks might consider putting in place an internal system for the assessment of SMEs’ creditworthiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">That might also make it feasible to give interested third parties access to those credit scores.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">However, it is also possible to indirectly facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to the capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">That would require a revitalisation of the securitisation market that has virtually dried up in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.78,0)">The reputation of asset-backed securities   has been bad ever since the problems with mortgage-backed securities in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, there were hardly any defaults on securitisations in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.55,0)">Between mid-2007 and the first quarter of 2013, the default rate on securitisations in the EU was only around 1.4%, while that in the United States was 17.4% over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">That should be acknowledged by the regulatory authorities who should adjust and harmonise the equity capital requirements accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Robust European securitisation platforms could provide a sensible complement to bank-based financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Analogous to the German market for borrowers’ note loans, other Member States, too, might attempt to establish a regime for the private placement of securities in order to provide SMEs with further alternative ways of raising financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">To this end, common and standardised regulatory and accounting methodologies would be good to have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.27,0)">Unfortunately, fragmented structures can also be found in the field of public sector support measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">Possible counteraction on the part of the political domain might be to encourage development banks such as Germany’s Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau   or its Spanish counterpart, the Instituto de Crédito Oficial  , to engage in cross-border business, which would demand that the statutes of development banks be amended accordingly in some cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In addition, national development banks might coordinate their activities more closely with the European Investment Bank   and also increase their cooperation with one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For example, they could exchange information on successful approaches and develop a set of tools for appropriate financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">If the political domain ensures that fundamentals are attractive and if sound enterprises again have the possibility to raise adequate financing, the basic prerequisites would be given to allow industry to invest again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">If the investment involved is productive investment, this would help to consolidate the tentative economic recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">Concluding remarks That brings me to the end of my deliberations today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Europe’s economy is gradually recovering from a phase of stagnation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Adjustment is taking place not only at the European level, but also in every single Member State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The progress made in the so-called crisis countries, in particular, shows that macroeconomic adjustment can indeed be successful even in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.97,0)">Such processes, however, take time and can be painful at times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The challenge in 2014 and beyond remains the further development of the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">That means creating the prerequisites for sustainable growth, which includes improving the climate for investment and making it structurally easier for SMEs to raise bank loans and access the capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">If we succeed in this, Europe could emerge from the crisis stringer than it was before.</span><span
