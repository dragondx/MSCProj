    <span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)"> Business conditions and the economic outlook in the euro area Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the International Chamber of Commerce Deutschland, Berlin, 26 October 2000 Ladies and gentlemen, Introduction We have come together to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the International Chamber of Commerce Deutschland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Early in the last century, the founders of the International Chamber of Commerce were convinced that trade was a powerful force for peace and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Although dreadful years were to come, I think they were right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In a way, Europe has built up on this very same idea over the past half century, from the start of the European Coal and Steel Community to later developments such as the single market and, as a corollary of that, the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In this respect, there have thus been clear parallels in thinking among policy-makers and entrepreneurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The International Chamber of Commerce of today still stands for the principle of open international trade and investment in a free market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">That this principle has been promoted in Germany for 75 years now, is indeed worth a "Festakt".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The topic of my speech today is "Business conditions and the economic outlook in the euro area".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">While I cannot give you any golden rules on how best to conduct business in the euro area, I can say something about the environment in which business is conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This environment can be split into two characteristic parts, both of which are highly important for doing business: first, the structural economic environment and, second, the conjunctural economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I shall talk about both today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Regarding the structural environment, I shall focus on those developments in the euro area which make it increasingly one large integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On the conjunctural environment, I shall discuss the outlook for the economy of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The main message is that, from my point of view, the prospects for doing business in the euro area are favourable, as the structural environment is clearly changing for the better and the conjunctural economic environment is good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The structural environment Let me start with reviewing the structural economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Given that we are celebrating a 75th anniversary, allow me to dwell somewhat on history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It was just after the Second World War that western Europe began its process of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It started in 1948, after the countries receiving Marshall Aid set up the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, which later became the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Soon afterwards, plans were made for more far-reaching forms of economic co-operation, looking for the possibilities for free trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">One of those plans, the so-called Schuman plan, was a French initiative, which was welcomed by Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In 1952, the six nations concerned created the European Coal and Steel Community, the first common market, albeit only for a limited number of products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Plans to eliminate more trade barriers began to emerge and, in 1957, the six countries signed the Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The EEC was to become a customs union for industrial products, without any custom duties for trade within the Community and with common tariffs for trade outside the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The subsequent broadening and deepening proves the success of this Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Developments in the last decade have further promoted free trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, the foundations of a level playing field were laid with the creation of the Single Market in 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This enhanced the possibilities for business by extensively reducing the regulations on cross-border trade within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Second, this Single Market project was supplemented by the single currency, the euro, which has been introduced in, thus far, 11 of the 15 Member States of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union has created a "zone of stability" in Europe, by eliminating exchange rate fluctuations between these eleven countries, by establishing a common monetary policy aimed at price stability for the area as a whole and by the commitment of the fiscal authorities to the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A stable public policy environment is expected to foster business activity, as it lowers the risk premia paid either implicitly or explicitly in many transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The clearest example of a reduction in the risk premia resulting from Monetary Union is the fact that there is no longer any need for currency hedging in transactions across the countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Through the introduction of the single currency, the euro area of today can thus increasingly be perceived as one large market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is a market that extends from Lisbon to Helsinki and - in the near future - from Dublin to Athens, as Greece will be joining Monetary Union as from 1 January 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In terms of its population, the euro area market is even larger than that of the United States - it has about 300 million inhabitants, some 10% more than the United States, and it is expected to grow even further, as more countries will probably join in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro area thus constitutes one large market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Of course, that market is still evolving and has not yet reached its ultimate state of development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.42,0)">For example, the euro as such currently exists only in the financial markets and, to some extent, in the business sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.37,0)">Consumers still calculate and pay in their own national currency unit, which is a handicap for increasing awareness of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This will end with the cash changeover in 2002, which tends to be perceived by the general public as the true start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.96,0)">In itself, the cash changeover is a gigantic logistic operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Moreover, there will be a period in which both the old national currency units and the euro will circulate simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The cash changeover will also achieve one of the main advantages of the single currency: transparency of prices in all markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">This will further facilitate the emergence of a truly single market, because it will be increasingly difficult to maintain price differentials for the same or similar products between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Even though market segmentation may occur for various reasons, such as the particular tax situation or different technical specifications, pressure will increase on both entrepreneurs and regulators, as consumer and large retail organisations will become increasingly aware of the price differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">But there are more things to do to further integrate the euro area markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.95,0)">There still exist structural rigidities in many countries, which affect the proper functioning of product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">A continuation both of moderate wage settlements and of structural reforms will be essential contributions to a further improvement of the functioning of European markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The introduction of new technology requires flexibility of other factors, including labour, if production processes are to be reorganised most efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.01,0)">If there are limits and restrictions to the adjustment to the most profitable combination of productive factors, the levels of investment in the new technologies will accordingly be affected negatively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It must be noted that the introduction of the euro has contributed to the awareness of policy-makers throughout Europe that structural reforms are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And although many reforms have yet to be implemented, substantial progress has nonetheless been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Governments have acted in the field of product markets in order to make them more competitive to the benefit of consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The favourable impact that opening up sectors to competition has on prices, growth and employment has become clear in the telecommunications and energy sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The challenge now is to further reduce the level of regulation so as to stimulate activities in other sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.16,0)">With regard to the fiscal position, there is a relatively high tax burden and there are still a number of countries with a very high debt ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Fiscal policies must thus be firmly committed to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to enhance the soundness of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">However, it is important to remember that the Treaty, supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, reflects a broad agreement and provides for basic principles in the field of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In particular, it requires that countries in the EU, and especially those that have adopted the euro, respect a common code of fiscal conduct that is expected to uphold discipline in the management of government finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In this respect, a remarkable evolution can already be seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The fiscal position of euro area countries could, on average, show a substantial improvement this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In part, this is due to stronger growth and substantial one-off windfall gains from mobile telephone licences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">But it is also the reward for many years of fiscal reform, which started in the run-up to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In several Member States, major tax reforms are planned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The ongoing and planned tax reductions are welcome steps towards reducing distortions in the economy and producing positive supply-side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">However, they should be fully offset by primary spending cuts to prevent a pro-cyclical loosening of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As regards the financial markets, the introduction of the euro has led to a unified money market throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.22,0)">Before the start of Economic and Monetary Union, criticism was sometimes heard to the effect that the decentralised monetary policy framework was bound to become too complex and inefficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">However, from a technical point of view, highly developed information technologies make decentralisation entirely feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.12,0)">Consequently, after almost 22 months of experience with this system, such criticism is no longer heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">There seems to be almost unanimous agreement that it works well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Indeed, the rapid integration of the euro area money market, with the crucial support of an integrated payment systems infrastructure, in particular the "TARGET" system, was a precondition for the successful implementation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">There still remains a need to further develop financial markets in Europe - especially with regard to the provision of risk capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">However, the introduction of the euro has, in fact, involved a process of integration of national financial markets, which is increasing the size and liquidity of the financial market and fostering its depth and breadth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">The European financial system is changing rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Although it is still predominantly bank-oriented, the change is clearly in the direction of a greater role for markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">There has, for example, been a rapid growth of the euro-denominated private bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The euro did not cause this trend, but it has given it a major impetus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The process of monetary policy-making and its implementation has functioned efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The evolution both of external inflation forecasts and of inflation expectations derived from the analysis of long-term interest rates   indicates that the financial markets and economists widely expect medium-term price developments that are in line with the ECB's definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Obviously, bond yields and many external forecasts incorporate expectations of future policy changes and therefore offer a judgement on prospective monetary policy decisions, as well as on decisions taken in 1999 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">As such, they provide a positive assessment of the overall monetary framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Actual inflation in 1999 stood at 1.1%, compatible with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Although inflation has increased this year, it is still relatively low, both historically and compared with the United States, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Above all, as indicated earlier, Monetary Union has proven to be a catalyst for major improvements in the structural economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In this respect, there is thus also reason to expect that the euro area could benefit over time from the advances in the new technologies, as the United States has apparently been doing already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Europe is thus changing and much has already been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The advances are noteworthy, although they are not always appreciated, not even by Europeans themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">There remains a great deal to be done in order to further upgrade the structural environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">However, this in itself creates opportunities for the future as there is a large potential to be exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Outlook for euro area economy Let me now turn to the conjunctural side of the economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Where economic growth is concerned, the euro area economy has impressively overcome the negative mood prevailing in early 1999, recovering to reach a state of affairs not seen for more than a decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Real GDP growth in the euro area has shown a strong performance since mid-1999, with four consecutive quarters of 0.9% growth, quarter-on-quarter, and the forces underlying sound growth in the medium term remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The external environment remains favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Domestic demand is expected to continue to be strong as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Consumption is benefiting from high consumer confidence and further increases in employment, and investment is being stimulated by higher corporate profitability and increasing rates of capacity utilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Domestic financing conditions are also good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This positive outlook for growth is confirmed by available forecasts from international institutions, such as the IMF and OECD, as well as by Consensus forecasts, which project growth in the euro area in the next one to two years to be higher than in 1999, with an increase from close to 2 1/2% last year, to above 3% this year and the next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">It is true that recent indicators suggest that, following the period of acceleration, the economic expansion may now be levelling-off, albeit at a robust pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.15,0)">Growth in industrial production excluding construction has decelerated somewhat recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.51,0)">The Purchasing Managers' Index declined in the course of the summer, which would indicate that a turning point may have been reached in year-on-year growth of industrial production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, however, the index still points to continued strong rates of growth after the first half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, sustained high levels of industrial confidence, as shown by the EC survey, suggest that growth remains robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.41,0)">Although consumer confidence fell in September, it remained clearly above its long-term average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.57,0)">However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the significant increase in oil prices observed in the past months may temporarily dampen growth dynamics over the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Thus far in October, oil prices - measured in terms of UK Brent - have remained above USD 31 per barrel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">If oil prices were to develop according to futures prices for the remainder of this year, the oil price increase for 2000 as a whole would amount to more than USD 10, compared with the average price in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.7,0)">The oil price increase has caused the terms of trade of the euro area to deteriorate, and has thus also had a certain negative impact on the growth of real income for the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">However, it can be noted that the reduced oil dependence since the first oil shock in 1973 limits the overall impact of any price rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Against the background of a generally favourable economic outlook, the increase in oil prices can be seen as occurring at a point in time when euro area economic activity should not be overly sensitive to shocks of this kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The oil price increases have influenced recent price developments and still continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The same holds true of the depreciation of the euro exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.48,0)">Overall inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  , may well remain above 2% for a more protracted period than expected earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.04,0)">We are currently seeing the direct effects of such external developments on the HICP rate of inflation, which was 2.3% in August and 2.8% in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Looking at the HICP excluding energy, the rise in September was 1.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The ECB has as its primary objective to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase of below 2% in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The main tool which the ECB has for maintaining price stability is the control of short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.78,0)">However, interest rate changes only impact prices after some lag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The ECB thus aims at maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.99,0)">The current oil price and exchange rate developments cannot be remedied by monetary policy in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, it is imperative that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The ECB has increased its interest rates in steps by a total of 225 basis points since November 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The gradual tightening of monetary policy was needed to preserve the prospects for price stability, thereby contributing to sustainable output and employment growth in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">A monetary policy committed to price stability is the best way to ensure that monetary policy makes its full contribution to overall economic welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">By pre-emptively responding to threats to price stability, both sharper increases in interest rates at a later stage and pronounced swings in economic activity can be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The challenge is to translate the current cyclical upswing into a sustained period of robust non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The key to a lasting increase in the growth potential of the euro area lies in the continuation of structural measures to enhance the flexibility of the labour and goods markets and in the maintenance of sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.98,0)">Governments must avoid the mistakes of the past, when fiscal policies were relaxed in response to the effects stemming from the increases in energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">At the current juncture, fiscal policies should avoid any pro-cyclical bias and should aim at reaching sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In addition, it will be important for social partners to continue to act as responsibly as they have done in the recent past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Wage moderation has made an important contribution to the progress observed thus far in job creation and in reducing unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Indeed, employment has grown by 1.8% in 1999 and by over 2% in the first half of 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.1,0)">And, since the start of Monetary Union, unemployment in the euro area has fallen by 1.5 percentage points, although it still remains relatively high at a rate of 9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">Any attempt for wages to catch up in reaction to recent oil price increases would be highly detrimental to the current favourable growth prospects, since monetary policy would need to react to the resulting upward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude at this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.88,0)">The structural environment is clearly changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Over the past decade or so, there has been a drive to integrating markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The euro area, with its single currency, will increasingly be perceived as one large market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This creates many opportunities for business within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.91,0)">It also creates challenges as competitive forces increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">These will no doubt intensify after the physical introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This will make consumers and enterprises increasingly aware of the existence and benefits of the common currency and will focus the spotlight on still existing price differences in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.57,0)">The structural environment also poses challenges for policy-makers, as the economy is still facing structural rigidities and a relatively high tax burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">However, the potential offered by the large euro area market is clearly already there to be exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Given the changes for the better on the structural side, I am confident that the euro area offers excellent opportunities for doing business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The current growth prospects are favourable and Europe can rely on a central bank which is firmly committed to maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This will serve to further promote what the founders of the International Chamber of Commerce had in mind: peace and prosperity.</span>
