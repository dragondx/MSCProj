    <span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)"> High-level policy dialogue of EMEAP central banks and the Eurosystem Introductory remarks to the press conference, Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, 26 July 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, Good evening to all of you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is a great pleasure to be here in Bangkok today together with Governor Prasarn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I also welcome you to the press conference on the occasion of the high-level policy dialogue of the Eurosystem and East Asia-Pacific central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This dialogue was jointly organised by the Bank of Thailand, which currently holds the chair of the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">I would like to use this opportunity to thank Governor Prasarn for hosting this event in Bangkok.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">This is the seventh time that the Eurosystem and East Asia-Pacific central banks have met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is an important and useful platform for exchanging views on issues of mutual interest to the central banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The crisis has subsided since we last met in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.41,0)">However the euro area and the global economy still face challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the euro area, the economy continued its moderate recovery in the second quarter, although rates of inflation remained too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.78,0)">Growth rates in the East Asia-Pacific region are generally robust, but below their pre-crisis levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Nevertheless, Asia has remained an engine of growth for the global economy, and our regions are increasingly interconnected through trade and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In this context, I very much appreciate the fruitful exchange of views with our counterparts here in the East Asia-Pacific region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">During our meeting today we focused on two topics:   Monetary policy in advanced economies, implications and policy responses in the emerging market economies, and   Lessons from the crisis in the euro area for monetary and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me briefly highlight some of the issues we discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Regarding monetary policy in advanced economies, we discussed the challenges faced by the major central banks during the financial crisis and the exceptional measures taken in response to those challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Today we can say with some certainty that the policies of central banks in advanced economies helped avert a more severe economic downturn in the wake of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Thus, those policies benefited the global economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">However, we also acknowledged spillovers, mainly in the form of capital flows to emerging markets, resulting from the highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies and the prospective exit from highly accommodative monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And we exchanged views on the policy responses in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In our discussions on the lessons from the euro area crisis we recognised the different approaches to regional integration in Asia and the euro area, for example, as regards objectives and the underlying institutions of cooperation and decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">A key lesson from our crisis is that institutions must take into account the degree of regional integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In the euro area, we have made big advances in strengthening the institutional framework of our Economic and Monetary Union – with the banking union being the most important one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We have also seen significant progress as stressed countries have adjusted their policies at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But there is no room for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Policy efforts both at the national and the European level need to be sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">We also exchanged views on the need for regional financial safety nets when regional financial integration is high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Both regions have mechanisms in place, namely the European Stability Mechanism and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, although they differ in terms of design and instruments.</span>
