    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> EU enlargement, some views from the ECB Bank of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The Zolotas Lecture by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Athens, 15 October 1999 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Let me begin by saying that it is a great honour to be invited here to speak to you on such a prestigious occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This is particularly so given Governor Zolotas'- or should I say Professor Zolotas' - stature as perhaps the most significant contributor to Greek monetary history over the past few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Indeed, during Professor Zolotas' time as Governor of the Bank of Greece, a period which, as we are all aware, extended well beyond two decades, the achievements of monetary policy were certainly quite impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.96,0)">The Greece of the early 1950s was certainly not the same as it is today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.41,0)">At that time the Greek economy, suffering from large fiscal deficits and high inflation, was in urgent need of a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It is thus a great tribute to Governor Zolotas that, for many years following his arrival at the Bank of Greece, the monetary stability that had only just been achieved was both maintained and combined with a particularly rapid rate of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is therefore not surprising that this period in Greece's economic history has so often been referred to as the "golden era of the drachma".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.89,0)">Of course, times change, and with them the economic and monetary environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.57,0)">This was certainly the case in the 1970s when, following the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system and the explosion of oil prices, monetary authorities around the world were faced with new and difficult challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In many countries, attempting to meet these challenges was accompanied by a move to flexible exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">However, for the most part, we Europeans attempted and eventually succeeded in treading a different path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This was also the case here, when, in the latter years of Governor' Zolotas' time in charge at the Bank of Greece, exchange rate stability was sought by pegging the drachma to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.61,0)">As we all know, at that time Greece was not yet a member of the European Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.09,0)">But this was also soon to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Indeed, assisting in the successful preparation for membership of the European Community is yet another notable contribution that Governor Zolotas made to Greece's economic history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.28,0)">Since that time Greece has continued to face challenges as a member of the European Community, and now of course of the European Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Greece is one of the four EU Member States which have not yet adopted the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It has announced its willingness to do so in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In order to join the euro area, the convergence criteria with respect to inflation, long-term interest rates, public finances and exchange rate stability have to be fulfilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Sustainable convergence is a prerequisite for adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This is in the interest of the countries which have already introduced the euro, but even more so in the interest of new countries entering the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.42,0)">Without having achieved sustainable convergence, the loss of the exchange rate and interest rate instrument could cause costly tensions in the economy at the expense of growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The determined efforts of Greece to achieve such convergence have to be commended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.94,0)">However, it is too early to reach a firm conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Next year, the European Central Bank   will produce a convergence report to analyse what has been accomplished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me repeat and underline that achieving convergence is not a process which ends with adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">On the contrary, being a member of the euro area and being able to benefit from the potentially great opportunities that offers call for ongoing adaptation to the new environment and the new rules of the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">It is like in sports: reaching the top is difficult, but staying there is even harder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.8,0)">Integrating one or more of the EU Member States which have not previously introduced the euro will be a challenge for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, an even greater challenge for Europe as a whole lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I am referring to the enlargement of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">First, I shall deal with that process in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Then, I should like to say a few words about how the Eurosystem   is meeting this challenge, in particular since EU enlargement also implies the eventual adoption of the euro by the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Before doing so, however, I should like to make clear that I am not able to repeat Governor Zolotas' remarkable performances at the World Bank some years ago, when he made speeches in English using only Greek words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Enlargement of the European Union Let me begin generally by saying that the forces and motivations driving the enlargement process are the very same as those that have driven the process of European integration over the past 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Moreover, these forces have shown themselves to be extremely powerful, as can be seen from the remarkable events that have taken place since the Schuman declaration nearly half a century ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Some 50 years ago, it was already clear to Europe's political leaders that they needed to overcome the nationalism which had ultimately led to two world wars and devastated much of Europe in the first half of this century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In order to ensure a future of peace and stability they needed instead to pursue policies which would bring European nations closer together and in so doing eliminate the risk of future conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.13,0)">This, as I believe we are all aware, was one of the original "political" motives behind European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of course, the world has changed a great deal since the Treaty of Paris, and with it the political motives driving the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Nevertheless, if one draws a parallel between the world of 50 years ago and the world of today, one cannot deny that the current enlargement process is driven, at least in part, by the desire to ensure a future of peace and stability for the whole of Europe, and not just for the 15 nations which currently comprise the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Of perhaps even greater significance in today's globalising world are the "economic" forces driving European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is not to say that they were not already important in the early years of the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.25,0)">Indeed, just as it became apparent 50 years ago that Europe needed to break free from the ghost of nationalism, so too it became clear that the protectionism of the inter-war period also had to be abandoned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">This was an essential prerequisite for restoring economic growth and improving social conditions in post-war Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">And so it is for the accession countries today, which no doubt see their integration into the EU as a way of ensuring that the necessary conditions are created for the sustainable, long-term growth of their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of course, these political and economic forces to which I refer are very closely linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.44,0)">So much so, that it is hard to imagine one without the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is no doubt one of the reasons why economic integration and political integration are often seen as going hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Indeed, the lessons of history tell us that political objectives are rarely met unless they are supported by a sound economic footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this is where the role of a central banker comes in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.49,0)">As central bankers we are not politicians and nor should we try to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Our role is to support wider economic and political objectives by creating the monetary conditions conducive to prolonged non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In this way we can exert a positive influence on the overall external environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But it is also true that the nature of our tasks is heavily influenced by economic and political events, and not least at present, the ongoing integration and enlargement process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I shall return to this point in a short while.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Before doing so, however, I should like to point out that there is a third factor which is not entirely political or economic, but which has nevertheless tended to reinforce the seemingly unstoppable momentum towards ever closer European integration and, more recently, enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This third force stems from our common European identity, which has developed out of many centuries of shared history and cultural heritage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Here in Greece one only has to look, as it were, outside the window to see and understand this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.13,0)">Until a decade ago, one might have been fooled into thinking that there were in fact two separate European identities supported by two distinct economic systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.52,0)">However, this would be to deny the close ties which still existed, even under the difficult circumstances of the time, between countries both east and west of the Iron Curtain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Events since the fall of the Berlin Wall have now shown that this difficult period did not destroy but merely delayed a process of further European integration - including both East and West - which is a natural consequence of our shared political and economic interests and our common cultural heritage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.6,0)">Ever since the velvet revolutions which swept across central and eastern Europe a decade ago, it has been apparent that, as part of their difficult transition to properly functioning market economies, these countries would become increasingly integrated with the economies of Western Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, it was clear that this process, with its ultimate objective of accession to the European Union, could not be achieved instantaneously, but would have to be extended over a period of time, in some cases a considerable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.76,0)">No other scenario could be foreseen, given the largely uncharted path which these countries had to tread in dismantling the old system of central planning and replacing it with the structures necessary to support a properly functioning market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It goes without saying that, at the beginning of the 1990s, neither an immediate nor rapid accession of these countries to the EU would have been feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Nor would it have been in the interests of the transition countries themselves, in particular since their economies would not have been able to survive in a competitive Single European Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Nevertheless, there was an obvious need, even then, both to make it known that the door would be open for these countries to join when the time was right and the conditions were met, and also to give guidance and add impetus to the transition process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">For these reasons the gradual approach which has been pursued since that time has indeed been the right one with a view to successfully achieving the final objective of full accession to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">In this regard, agreements have been signed, institutions have been created and initiatives have been undertaken as part of a general framework for supporting the transition and accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Some of these have certainly played an important role and it would seem worth mentioning just a few of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">First of all, the Europe Agreements which were signed between the EU and each of the applicant countries provide a sound and legitimate basis for economic co-operation in a large number of sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Since then, the Association Councils have been keeping the transition process on track by regularly examining the accomplishments of economic reforms in the candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The Joint Assessments also play a crucial role in identifying the medium-term economic policy priorities and the Accession Partnerships do likewise with regard to the establishment of priorities for EU technical assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Following the tremendous efforts of the last few years, we have now arrived at a stage in which there are no less than 12 applications for EU membership currently under consideration, 10 of these from transition countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Moreover 6 of the 12 have already begun accession negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">When addressing the issue of enlargement, we may ask ourselves what exactly should be required of a member state of the European Union and on what criteria should the eligibility of a candidate country be assessed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.59,0)">Of course, these are not usually questions asked of central bankers and it is certainly not my intention to provide answers to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.39,0)">As I mentioned earlier, central bankers are not politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But fortunately, there is no need for me to provide answers, since these issues have already been addressed within the context of the current enlargement process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">I am referring here to the so-called "Copenhagen criteria".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As I am sure you are aware, these criteria were formulated at the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 with a view to defining a level playing field and ensuring the equal treatment of applicant states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The first of these criteria, generally known as the "political criterion" calls for a candidate country to have stable institutions which guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for and the protection of minorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I shall not comment on this criterion as its purpose and meaning are quite clear to us all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The "economic criterion", as the second of these criteria is termed, requires the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The economic reasoning which lies behind this criterion is also quite straightforward and requires little elaboration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">However, I should like to add that for the accession countries, while it is no doubt a difficult and sometimes painful task, fulfilling this criterion is an essential step towards creating a solid basis for future non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And finally, there is the third criterion concerning the adoption of the so-called "acquis communautaire".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This requires that a candidate country be able to take on the obligations of EU membership, including the adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is this last point which is of course most relevant to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">EU enlargement and the Eurosytem As I understand it, it has been decided that no new "opt-out" clauses, such as those negotiated by the United Kingdom and Denmark, shall be available to new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This implies that, when joining the EU, the new Member States will have to comply with all of the requirements outlined in the acquis communautaire which relate to European Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Moreover, following accession, they shall each have to prepare themselves for the eventual adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.57,0)">Thus it is clear that the accession process and the entry of new members into the EU will have deep and wideranging consequences for the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Of course, meeting the Maastricht convergence criteria is not a prerequisite for joining the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">However, the introduction of the euro certainly puts some pressure on accession countries to make progress towards fulfilling the convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In fact, we might consider their progress towards adopting the euro as part of a continuum, encompassing three distinct stages and crucial steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">These are: EU membership, participation in ERM II, and eventual adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The first of these steps requires implementation of the EMU-related acquis communautaire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Then, on the date of accession, new Member States will join EMU with the status of "countries with a derogation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">From this point onwards, they will be expected not only to treat their economic policies as a matter of common concern, but also to be committed to the eventual adoption of the euro, which should be an objective both of monetary and of other economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is a direct result of the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, no new opt-out clauses are to be granted to the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">With the ultimate goal of adopting the euro in mind, the new Member States will, once they have achieved a sufficent degree of convergence, be expected to participate in ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Following this, when the Maastricht criteria are met, the new Member States can then be expected to exchange their national currencies for the euro and become full participants in Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our role as central bankers is heavily influenced by the external economic and political environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Moreover, it is essential that we remain aware of the changes taking place and that we seek to play an active and constructive role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This must certainly be the case as far as EU enlargement is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As a result of this process, the competencies of the Eurosystem, namely monetary policy, exchange rate policy, the smooth functioning of payment systems and financial stability, will become directly relevant as soon as the applicant countries join the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Thus, if the challenge of EU enlargement and the subsequent enlargement of the euro area is to be successfully met, it is essential that we are prepared for it when the time comes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For this reason the Eurosystem is already closely monitoring developments in accession countries which are directly related to its areas of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Naturally this is being done in co-operation with the accession countries themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">A network of contacts has already been set up with the relevant central banks, and several bilateral as well as multilateral meetings at expert level have been convened in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">It goes without saying that these working relationships will be intensified over the coming months and years with a view to deepening such co-operation in areas of specific interest to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this regard, for example, a high-level meeting with the central banks of the accession countries will be held in Helsinki as early as next month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Since the successful integration of the accession countries into the euro area will ultimately depend on the policy strategies which they adopt, the Eurosystem is already taking a particular interest in these strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In this regard, it is quite encouraging that, in most cases, the monetary policies pursued are increasingly similar to those of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">First, they aim at achieving and maintaining price stability by supporting a disinflation process which is in some cases already fairly advanced, even if performance generally still remains out of line with EMU standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And second, their strategies are increasingly based upon the process of using indirect and market-based instruments to control the degree of liquidity of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">More precisely, these strategies include the use of standing facilities, repurchase agreements and other open market operations, and deposit reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With regard to exchange rate policy, the accession countries currently pursue a variety of strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is not for me to comment at this stage on what might be the most appropriate exchange rate strategy for individual candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.86,0)">This is clearly an issue on our research agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.33,0)">However, it is clear that with their entry into the EU and the consequent liberalisation of capital movements, accession countries will become less and less able to target their exchange rate without "importing" their monetary policy from the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">One may therefore expect that the monetary strategies of these countries will increasingly be conducted with a view to an orderly entry into ERM II and the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The Eurosystem also has a vital interest in the proper functioning of financial systems in accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This is not least the case because integration into EU structures will entail increased competition for banks and other financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Thus, our interest in this area concerns not only the general need for financial sector reform, but also, more specifically, the need to ensure the stability of the financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">To this end, we have already begun monitoring developments in the banking and financial sectors of accession countries, as well as their general payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Of course, in the context of compliance with EU legal and institutional requirements, the accession countries will be expected to adopt EU legislation in the area of financial services, including those related to banking, insurance and investment firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Moreover, against the background of the Copenhagen criteria, they will also be required to meet the broader set of structural and institutional requirements necessary for the establishment of an efficient and competitive banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise that establishing sound and efficient banking, financial and payment systems is also an essential requirement for a proper conduct of monetary policy and therefore also for successful participation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is true for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">First, the creation of deep and liquid capital markets is a necessary step if indirect and market-based instruments involving a number of counterparts are to be used for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.69,0)">Second, in the absence of sufficiently developed capital markets, it might be difficult for accession countries to comply with the rules relating to the prohibition of privileged access to the financial system of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.34,0)">And finally, structural weaknesses in the financial system could also have implications for the monetary policy transmission mechanism, since poor competition and soft budget constraints may affect the responsiveness of banks to changes in the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It is not surprising therefore that the Eurosystem has a particular interest in keeping banking and financial sector developments in accession countries under close review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">At this point I should like to recall that the Eurosystem is not part of the EU institutional framework which has been set up for the current enlargement process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.27,0)">Enlargement is a political decision which concerns the Member States of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">However, it seems natural that the Eurosystem will become more and more involved in this process in the near future, in particular given the implications of enlargement for our main tasks and objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Moreover, it is clear that the Eurosystem will play an important advisory role in areas related to its competencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How should the Eurosystem address and view the enlargement process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">Let me make a few general remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">First, it is my view that the Eurosystem should adopt a constructive attitude towards the prospect of EU enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This applies also to the participation of new EU Member States in ERM II and their eventual adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The Eurosystem should be prepared to advise the accession countries both in undertaking necessary structural reforms and in pursuing the stability-oriented policies which are required in order to fulfil the accession and convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Moreover, the Eurosystem should also stand ready to cope with additional requests to provide technical assistance to these countries and, in particular, to their central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">A second observation is that the Eurosystem should support equal treatment as a key feature of the accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This implies that objective and uniform criteria should apply, in turn, to accession, participation in ERM II and adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The criteria related to each step of the process should be implemented in a strict and effective manner, in order to provide the countries concerned with the external constraints necessary to bring their economies in line with the respective standards, while at the same time avoiding any discrimination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Of course, against a background of different starting points and varying degrees of economic transition, a plurality of approaches should be feasible without compromising equality of treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, we do not expect the candidate countries to join the EU or to adopt the euro in a single wave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, irrespective of the individual time frames pursued, what is clear is that the accession process requires a significant amount of preparatory work on the part of all involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Conclusion It is probably unnecessary for me to remind you that,
