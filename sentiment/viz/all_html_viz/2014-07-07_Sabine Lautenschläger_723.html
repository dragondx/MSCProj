    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)"> Low inflation as a challenge for monetary policy and financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Parliamentary Evening, Hamburg,7 July 2014 *** Summary Although low interest rates might have side effects with respect to financial stability, they were necessary for the ECB to fulfil its mandate of ensuring price stability, said Sabine Lautenschläger, member of the ECB’s Executive Board, in a speech at an event organised by the Deutsche Bundesbank in Hamburg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">“The risks of the rate of inflation being too low over a long period are not to be underestimated,” she explained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.33,0)">The experience of Japan had proven that an unanchoring of inflation expectations could start a downward spiral – consumers and investors could change their behaviour and defer spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.69,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council had therefore cut the main refinancing rate and had decided on a package of instruments to encourage banks to lend more to corporations and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.76,0)">Excessively low inflation rates made it harder for stressed countries to adjust their economies and regain competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.29,0)">“We   soon find ourselves in a vicious circle in the euro area”, Lautenschläger warned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It would take some time before the measures adopted took effect, especially the instruments designed to increase liquidity, she explained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">“I would expect that to happen next year, rather than this year.” Should inflation rates not increase gradually as expected, the Governing Council was unanimous in its readiness to decide on further unconventional measures to effectively counter the risks related to an excessively long period of low interest rates, said Ms Lautenschläger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A broadly ranging programme of securities purchases was basically an instrument that a central bank could use, Lautenschläger claimed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.5,0)">But the requirement to be met for such a use had to be very high, because of the significant potential side effects, she said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">What was also being discussed was a revitalisation of the market for asset-backed securities  , which Lautenschläger regarded as a worthwhile goal to the extent that transparent and simple securitisations were involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For such ABSs, a purchase programme would be possible, but the ECB should only take on liquidity risk and no credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Taking on credit risk, for example to encourage lending to small and medium-sized companies, was the responsibility of the governments of Member States, said Lautenschläger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.61,0)">An easing of monetary policy has side effects on asset prices, said Lautenschläger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">That could reduce risk aversion and increase the threat of asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.32,0)">In addition, indebtedness could increase further and the flexibility of monetary policy action could be undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.28,0)">Those were risks that should not be addressed by monetary policy to the detriment the central bank’s price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.66,0)">On the other hand, this did not mean that there could not be any response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Instruments of macro-prudential supervision should be used, said Lautenschläger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.47,0)">For example, higher capital requirements could slow down lending in the event of excesses on regional real estate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.62,0)">*** President Griep, Senator Tschentscher, Ladies and Gentlemen, The European debt crisis mercilessly uncovered the imbalances in the euro area that had long been hidden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.94,0)">It has generated huge economic costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It has presented major challenges, especially for those of us responsible for monetary policy, not least because we do not act in a vacuum where politics are irrelevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Sound national budgets and competitive economies are basic requirements for effective monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">But it also set in motion urgently needed adjustment processes in many countries, as well as deep-reaching institutional reforms, all of which may make for healthier and more robust economic and monetary union if they are followed through to their conclusion consistently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">However, patience, stamina and reliability will be required to get there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The euro area economy is recovering from the deep recession, but only extremely slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.84,0)">Growth is currently only moderate and unemployment remains at record levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.06,0)">Lending is also still extremely subdued in large parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">All this means that wages and prices are rising only marginally and will do so only very moderately in the euro area in the coming years, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.94,0)">According to Eurostat’s estimate, the rate of inflation in June was just 0.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And, although the projections show a slow rise in the rate of inflation to 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, this would still fall short of the target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">At its meeting in June the ECB Governing Council was united in its reaction to the risks associated with such a subdued price outlook and approved a package of measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This package was necessary to fulfil our primary mandate of maintaining price stability, even if it could have unwanted side effects – but more on that later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With respect to assessing the June measures and their risks, I would like to start by briefly explaining when I believe monetary policy action is called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The mandate, which is clearly formulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, forms the basis of any monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">It states: “The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The ECB Governing Council has given the objective of “price stability” a more specific, quantitative definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">You all know it: it is the famous 2% benchmark or, more precisely, our target of keeping the increase in prices for the euro area at below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.65,0)">Many expectations are associated with this target, which are often very different, depending on the traditions and experiences of inflation that prevail in the respective country: some expect the 2% target to be adhered to in every country; some become restless and see an immediate obligation to act if inflation exceeds or falls short of the target for one or two months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Others in turn only see there being a risk if inflation rises above the 2% benchmark; the risks of inflation being low for too long are then considered minor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">And there are lots of economists who see inflation being higher than 2% as the solution to the crisis and the difficult adjustment processes faced by national economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Of course, it is not about price increases in individual countries: we make monetary policy for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And the focus is not on the prices of individual goods or services, but the stability of price levels in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">That is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">However, it is more important that price stability should be ensured in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is therefore not about achieving an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% every month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This cannot actually be done through monetary policy in an open market economy with free competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So a central bank should not expose itself every month to pressure to take action, but orient itself towards the projected rate of inflation over a two to three-year horizon and of course inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At the same time, however, price stability should not be postponed ad infinitum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.82,0)">And we should certainly address upward and downward deviations in the rate of inflation from the desired target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">After all, the risks of the rate of inflation being too low over a long period are not to be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">For me, keeping the downward gap to the benchmark within limits is therefore part of the price stability mandate in order to firmly anchor inflation expectations and reduce the risks of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Despite this more quantitative definition of price stability, monetary policy is not a mechanistic process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.08,0)">The decisions as to what monetary policy measure to take and whether it is the right one depend on the causes of the very weak price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.05,0)">For example, is sluggish lending weakening demand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.55,0)">Do the weak price developments reflect necessary adjustment processes in the crisis countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.05,0)">Or are fluctuating oil and food prices driving the sharp fall in the rate of inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Oil and particularly food prices more recently have indeed played a key role in inflation developments in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.82,0)">And the increases in prices of services are also tending to decline, all in all, even if it is likely that this can mainly be attributed to developments in the crisis countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.9,0)">Such price changes are normally only reflected in the inflation rate temporarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.69,0)">Monetary policy therefore does not normally react to temporary oil or food price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The fact that our mandate is geared towards the medium term allows us to look beyond such short-term developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.85,0)">So why did we deem it necessary to act?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.17,0)">In the current situation, keeping a steady hand on the tiller would have endangered our mandate of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.19,0)">After all, the interplay between falling oil prices, an appreciating currency and a very faltering recovery in demand in many parts of the euro area masks the risk of a phase of very low inflation lasting too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.03,0)">This can lead to market participants adjusting their inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They would then no longer be geared to our target of below, but close to, 2%, but perhaps to the prospect of very low rates of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.75,0)">The example of Japan shows that such a decoupling can directly endanger price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.51,0)">Falling inflation expectations may become firmly established in lower wage settlements, triggering a spiral of falling prices and expectations that would be difficult to escape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.71,0)">The risk is then that prices fall so sharply that, for example, consumers postpone their purchasing decisions because they expect prices to fall even further, and companies put off investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.58,0)">This does not just harbour considerable risks for price stability in the euro area; deflation also increases real debt, thereby impeding debt reduction, including the reduction of private debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.11,0)">Now many critics of the low interest rate policy point out that low prices are the consequence of the necessary adjustment processes in the crisis countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.64,0)">And these critics rightly argue that, in a similar way to short-term fluctuations in oil and food prices, such adjustment processes within the euro area seldom require a monetary policy reaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.54,0)">They are not normally reflected in the average rate of inflation for the euro area in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.41,0)">Rather, the issue here is relative price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Germany, too, went through this kind of reform process a number of years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">As a result, wage and prices in Germany were below the euro area average for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Back then, however, Germany was already able to improve its competitiveness thanks to low inflation, while rates of inflation in many other Member States were higher than that specified in our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Overall, though, inflation in the euro area was close to our benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.39,0)">However, the situation today is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.75,0)">Even in Germany, inflation is and remains very low – it stood at 0.6% in May and 1% in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.49,0)">Prices and wages in the crisis countries therefore need to fall even more sharply in order to make up competitive disadvantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.79,0)">This in turn makes economic recovery in these countries more difficult and may therefore exert further downward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.18,0)">Then we soon find ourselves in a vicious circle in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Overview of the measures adopted in June: design and necessity It was these risks – in particular, the danger of a decoupling of inflation expectations – that made the ECB’s Governing Council take responsive action in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In essence, the decisions of June comprise three elements: further interest rate cuts combined with the reaffirmation of our forward guidance; measures to improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism; and the announcement that work to prepare further possible measures in case they become necessary is under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.14,0)">The reason why we reduced the official interest rates to historical lows is that the outlook for inflation had declined yet again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">According to the latest estimates of Eurosystem economists, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area will rise by only 0.7% this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.17,0)">Their projections for next year put the rate of inflation at 1.1%, while the rate of inflation in 2016 is expected to be 1.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The projections are cautious even for Germany, where economic activity was brisk in the first half of the year and where the labour market is continuing to develop along favourable lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Consumer prices will probably rise by only 1.1% this year, and by 1.5% next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This compares with an average increase of 1.8% in prices in Germany over the past ten years A further easing of our monetary policy was thus appropriate in view of a long-lasting phase of extremely low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">What is important in this respect is that the reduction of the main refinancing rate is factored fully into rates on the money markets, in order to enable the monetary policy easing to full effect despite already very low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.28,0)">The negative interest rate we have put in place for banks’ deposits thus ensures that the interest rate corridor, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">the spread between the interest rates on deposits, main refinancing operations and marginal refinancing operations, is wide enough to continue to provide incentives for banks to trade actively on the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.35,0)">In addition, we have stopped the weekly withdrawal of the liquidity that injected into the markets by way of bond purchases under the Securities Markets Programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The higher excess liquidity thus created gives the process additional impetus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">And together with the negative interest rate on deposits, the package of measures adopted creates incentives for banks to no longer park their excess liquidity at the ECB, but rather to extend credit or to seek other productive investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The further reduction of our key interest rates in June was combined with measures to ensure that the monetary easing actually reaches those who need it most, namely enterprises still suffering from credit terms and conditions that, despite the accommodative monetary policy, remain clearly more restrictive than those for enterprises with comparable risk profiles in other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The additional measures are thus aimed at revitalising sluggish lending in the euro area through targeted injections of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.92,0)">For some time now, we have been observing with concern that the gap between actual lending levels and the lending levels that model-based estimates see as appropriate in the current phase of the business cycle is continuing to widen in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.21,0)">What exactly does that mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">After a recession, it is normal for lending to only pick up in a later stage of the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Enterprises, for instance, often first use internally generated funds to finance capital expenditure or investment and only take recourse to loans or other external funds after a while.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">In many countries, the reduction of debt levels in the wake of the severe distortions on the financial and housing markets is moreover curbing demand for credit still further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.38,0)">Lending is nonetheless stalling even more sharply than in earlier business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">Credit growth in the euro area has, for instance, been on the decline since the second half of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.45,0)">Even though more recent surveys undertaken by the Eurosystem on bank lending show that credit conditions in the crisis countries have largely stabilised in the first half of this year, around 60% of the banks report that the current terms and conditions for loans are more restrictive than those prevailing, on average, over the period since 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.49,0)">And if businesses or consumers know that they have to pay more for a loan than their credit standing would justify, they will not even ask for credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">That is exactly where the second part of our package of measures kicks in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The two targeted longer-term refinancing operations we have announced for September and December this year will allow banks to borrow, for a period of up to four years, funds in an amount of initially 7% of their euro area non-financial private sector loans outstanding at the end of April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The focus of our endeavours in this respect is clearly on loans to businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.63,0)">That is why residential loans to households have been excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Between March 2015 and June 2016, all Eurosystem counterparties will be able to borrow additional funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">That additional liquidity will, however, be closely linked to the respective bank’s net lending in order to ensure that the money actually goes where it is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But many of you may be asking yourselves whether, given that many banks are already repaying the funds raised through the previous three-year longer-term refinancing operations early, there is really any further need for long-term liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We are indeed noting that the terms and conditions under which banks can raise funds on the money and credit markets have eased considerably   since July 2012, and that this has slowly reduced their dependence on central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.39,0)">The TARGET balances relating to payment transactions between central banks have fallen by some €540 billion, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">have been almost halved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">These are favourable signs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Although financing conditions for banks in the crisis countries have improved dramatically, interest rates on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises   in these countries are nonetheless still significantly higher than those in Germany or other core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The high lending rates in the crisis countries are, of course, due to the higher credit risk there, as can also be seen from the high risk of default and the proportion of non-performing loans in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.9,0)">Some 25% of all loans extended to SMEs in the crisis countries are currently deemed to be non-performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">And, as a banking supervisor, I am happy that banks are pricing-in the risks inherent to lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It would be of only short-term benefit to the real economies of Member States if banks were to extend credit without any close and critical look at the associated risk of default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.52,0)">Enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized businesses, require a banking industry that is robust and does not immediately reduce its services whenever there is an even minor downturn in growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In order to ensure that banks remain fit and able to provide financing also over the medium to long term, the risk for each individual bank needs to be in proportion to the return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">Why do I nonetheless regard targeted injections of liquidity, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">targeted longer-term refinancing operations  , as appropriate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Aside from differences in credit risk, we are observing that the improvements in financing terms and conditions are not being passed on to businesses and consumers, and that this is happening even though assistance programmes have already seen the implementation of far-reaching measures to adjust the balance sheets of, for example, Spanish banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The low fixed interest rate on, and the extended maturity of, the new targeted injections of liquidity offer banks a different set of incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">We are ensuring planning certainty with regard to the cost of refinancing corporate loans and providing major help with respect to maturity transformation between longer-term lending and often short-term refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This could make one or another loan for corporate customers economically viable without our having to assume any credit risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.24,0)">Allow me to recall here that the interest rates on our earlier three-year longer-term refinancing operations were variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.1,0)">For banks, the greater uncertainty about the interest rate went hand in hand with greater uncertainty with respect to their own refinancing terms and conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The new longer-term refinancing operations have a different focus and will come to bear in an environment that has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Potential side effects will thus have a lesser impact because yield spreads have narrowed considerably, the economic outlook has brightened and – although there are, of course, residual uncertainties – the banks have significantly improved their capital positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">All these factors should help make banks show less restraint in their lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And in order to be able to fully benefit from the two refinancing operations of September and December – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">for them to make use of the funds raised over the full four years – the banks will need to expand their lending over and beyond our benchmark over the next two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.08,0)">Otherwise, they will be required to repay the borrowed funds in September 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures thereby encourage banks to again increase their lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">But the banks must also be sound enough to enable them to carry out their core business of supplying the real economy with credit for productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">That, too, is a reason why I attach such great importance to the comprehensive assessment exercise, the check-up on the health of banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Only banks that have properly written-off their losses and that are endowed with adequate capital will be able to extend credit at reasonable terms and conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">In anticipation of the comprehensive assessment, many banks have undertaken additional value adjustments, have sold assets and have stocked up their capital over the past 12 months – in short, they have cleaned up their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">That has eliminated yet another obstacle to an adequate supply of credit next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me return to our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Yes, we have adopted a comprehensive package of measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.14,0)">Immediately after the announcement of these measures at the ECB’s press conference, we were nonetheless confronted with the question: is that really all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">When and on what basis will we consider the adoption of further measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Patience is a virtue – that is all I can say on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It will take a while for all our measures to take effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Some responses will become visible sooner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In this respect, the re-affirmation of our forward guidance, the prolongation of the full allotment of our standard liquidity-providing operations up to the end of 2016, was of particular importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">This form of forward guidance underlines the likelihood, as expressed by the Governing Council, that key interest rates in the euro area will, given the same circumstances, remain at the same level for some time to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Other measure such as the targeted LTROs will take longer to have an impact – in this respect, I would expect that to happen next year, rather than this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Should a gradual improvement of the inflation outlook not materialise, despite the comprehensive decisions taken in June and contrary to our expectations, the Governing Council was unanimous in voicing its intent to also use unconventional measures within the scope of its mandate to effectively counter the risks of too long a period of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.09,0)">Does that mean that the Governing Council will run out the whole arsenal of countermeasures if, for example, new economic or geopolitical circumstances cause the rate of inflation not to converge on the desired benchmark more rapidly, as is expected at the moment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">I don’t think so, even though quite a number of market participants are already hoping for a broadly ranging bond purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Such a programme is, of course, one instrument in the set that is, in principle, at the disposal of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">However, the preconditions for the use of such a form of monetary policy intervention need to be particularly stringent, given that the side effects are singularly pronounced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.14,0)">Too low yields on government and corporate bonds could create the wrong incentives and thus pose a significant risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The underlying monetary policy reasoning behind its use must therefore be beyond question, especially in a monetary union comprising 18, and soon 19, sovereign countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">Such an instrument could only be considered in a true emergency, for example in the case of imminent deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Such risks, however, are currently neither discernible nor expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">What is also being discussed is the revitalisation of the market for securitised loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">That is certainly a worthy goal, given that asset-backed securities   have been exceedingly demonised since the outbreak of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">They certainly played a role in causing the crisis, but it must be borne in mind that not every case of securitisation is the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What I am thinking of in this respect are not re-securitisation positions and synthetic securitisation transactions, but rather of very simply and clearly constructed products that are far less risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.23,0)">The rate of default for European securitisations that are underpinned by SME loans, for instance, stands at around 0.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.38,0)">Since the onset of the crisis, the average default rate for Europe as a whole has been between 0.6% and 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.02,0)">Cause for concern are rather the default rates in the United States, which stood at between 9.3% and 18.4% over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Against this background, the Governing Council has decided, in cooperation with other relevant institutions, to gradually revitalise the market for ABSs, in particular that for securities backed by loans to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For me, that means looking once more at the capital requirements for ABS transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And in that respect, I am not thinking of endowing this field of business with any unjustified privileges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I am and remain firmly convinced that, in order to create a system of proper incentives for banks’ internal business and risk assessment strategies, the capital requirements imposed on banks must be aligned strictly to the risk entailed in the business operations involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As the cost of capital for ABS-related risks has been raised simplistically without much differentiation in Basel since 2010, it is now time for another look at this field of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But what can the ECB still do for the revitalisation of the ABS market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We have already relaxed the requirements for ABSs that are eligible for use as collateral in our refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.4,0)">We have lowered the minimum standard of creditworthiness for certain types of ABS, added further classes of ABS to our range of eligible collateral and reduced the valuation haircuts for ABSs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The market for ABSs could also be revitalised if the ECB were to directly purchase securities that are backed by corporate loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I have an open mind regarding the assumption of the liquidity risk involved in such a measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.9,0)">Depending on how these operations are designed, however, the ECB could take on not only the liquidity risk inherent to such paper, but also the credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.44,0)">In this regard, I have my doubts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.36,0)">If there is public interest in market intervention, for example in order to specifically encourage lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, the national governments of Member States should not be left out of the equation or, expressed more precisely, they should not be relieved of their responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">For instance, government guarantee programmes implemented via state development banks for the more risky ABS tranches could be a decisive contribution to success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Micro- and macro-prudential instruments to preserve financial stability I have now referred often enough to the benefits, but also the medium and long-term risks, of conventional and unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.56,0)">Prolonged phases of low interest rate policies and a generous supply of liquidity to banks simply do have a material influence on asset prices and the supply of credit to an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.96,0)">They may therefore also endanger financial stability, in particular if: they lead to declining risk aversion and the formation of financial market bubbles; the tendency to over-indebtedness increases; structural problems and productivity losses are not sufficiently tackled; the scope for monetary policy action is restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.73,0)">The more the key interest rates are lowered and the longer the low interest rate phase lasts, the bigger the risk that one of these undesired side effects materialises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">How should we respond to such developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.93,0)">Should monetary policymakers make compromises on their objective of price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And not only because I feel committed to our Treaty basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">A basis that we are not authorised to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Even if, in choosing its instruments, the ECB’s Governing Council cannot ignore the side effects but must precisely analyse the costs and benefits, the monetary policy objective of preserving price stability is always at the forefront; it is always the primary aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But that does not mean that we should simply accept these undesired side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Effective macro-prudential oversight, committed to preserving financial sector stability, is a central building block for a stable monetary and economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Europe has comprehensively responded to this lesson from the financial crisis and has created the appropriate legal and institutional preconditions, which must now be made a reality by all EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As our experience shows, it is not enough to gear regulation and supervision exclusively to the stability of individual financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is rather the close interaction between macro-prudential oversight and micro-prudential supervision that is one of the essential prerequisites for consistent crisis prevention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At European and national level, there are various institutions that can counter some, though not all, of the risks of asset bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">One such institution in Germany is the Financial Stability Commission, which is tasked with identifying and evaluating risks and recommending mitigating measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Recommendations may be addressed primarily to banking supervisors, which have in recent years acquired a broad toolbox of instruments through the various legislative initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For example, banking supervisors can now respond to a regional property bubble by subjecting banks to higher capital requirements in order to make credit more expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Thus the ECB, too, through the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, has macro-prudential powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">While the national authorities remain entitled to use macro-prudential instruments at the national level, they must notify the ECB of their measures in advance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The ECB has the option of tightening national measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In a sense, this is a protection against a failure to act at national level and hence improves the outlook for a more stable financial system in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Nonetheless, in particular with regard to macro-prudential supervision, there is still some conceptual work to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Work on a well-equipped toolbox of instruments, for example; instruments that might not only address banks, but also other financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, following this digression, let me be clear on one thing: preserving financial stability is truly a Herculean task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Our aim must be to make the whole financial system stronger and more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">So it’s a logical step for us to target all the measures at our disposal towards realising this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">But the ECB’s primary objective is still to maintain price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Stable prices are the basis for sustainable growth and a stable banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Our most recent monetary policy decisions do justice to this mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">As an independent central bank, we are committed to explaining our actions to democratically elected representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">But I personally find it particularly important to enter directly into dialogue with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I am therefore delighted to engage in a discussion with you now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Many thanks to the Bundesbank for giving us the opportunity to do so today.</span>
