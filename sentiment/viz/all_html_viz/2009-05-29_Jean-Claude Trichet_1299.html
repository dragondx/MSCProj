    <span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)"> The financial crisis and the role of central banks: The experience of the ECB Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the international symposium marking the 50th anniversary of Bank Al-Maghrib.Marrakech, 29 May 2009 Dear Governor Jouahri, Dear Governors, Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour and a great pleasure for me to be a speaker at this celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the Bank Al-Maghrib.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">I would like to congratulate Governor Jouahri on this occasion, and wish him and the staff of the central bank all the best for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The Eurosystem has a well-established framework for dialogue with the Bank Al-Maghrib, the Euro-Mediterranean Seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This forum regularly brings together the governors of Eurosystem central banks with those of the “Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The Euro-Mediterranean Seminar has, since its first meeting in 2004 in Naples, strengthened our dialogue by addressing various topics relevant to central banks around the Mediterranean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The Bank Al-Maghrib and Governor Jouahri have contributed to this fruitful exchange of views and will no doubt do so at the next meeting in March 2010 in Cyprus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In addition, the Bank Al-Maghrib has close bilateral relations with some of the central banks in the Eurosystem and in particular with the Banque de France on various aspects of technical assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.3,0)">We are living in a very challenging time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.13,0)">Morocco, like all countries worldwide, has been hit by the global crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The business cycles of Morocco and the EU are largely synchronised and the existence of various economic transmission channels such as trade, tourism, and remittances, explain why both the European and Moroccan economies are going through a challenging period in the present global context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">My speech today will focus on the global financial crisis and its roots, on the ECB’s response to the crisis and on the role of emerging market economies in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The global financial crisis and its roots Let me start by briefly highlighting the origins and evolution of the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.81,0)">Imagine a neutral observer who looked at the financial sector about a decade ago and then didn’t look at it again until the eve of the current financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">He would have found a completely different financial industry, one which over the past decade has undergone a dramatic shift of focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">He would have discovered a financial system that had moved away from its traditional role of supporting trade and real investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.14,0)">He would have found a financial system in which speculation and financial gambling had run rife.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.96,0)">He would have encountered a system transformed – a system no longer managing genuine economic risks but one actually creating and assuming financial risks – risks resulting from arbitrage and intentional exposure to asset price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">That same observer would have realised that financial liberalisation and innovation had made our economies more productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The securitisation of assets, for example, had great potential to diversify economic risks and to manage them efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.73,0)">But it also meant that financial institutions were able to sell loans or take them off the balance sheet, which weakened lenders’ incentives to conduct prudent screening and constant monitoring of credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.12,0)">So underwriting standards and lending oversight declined, and contributed to the excessive credit growth in the second half of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In sum, the observer would have concluded that the factors that fuelled the credit and asset price boom of the past decade also created the conditions for a bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.96,0)">In mid-2007 we started to see the backlash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.7,0)">The start of the financial turmoil was sudden but not unexpected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.84,0)">The financial system as it worked over the past decade – with its flawed incentives and its overly complex products and with global imbalances as its macroeconomic backdrop – was no longer sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.97,0)">The asset cycle turned, the weaknesses were exposed and investors suddenly lost confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">After years of exceptional risk appetite and high profits, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, as markets became extremely sensitive to financial risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.81,0)">In September last year, the crisis escalated sharply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In particular, a major financial player collapsed, which was directly involved in about 30 large payment and settlement systems worldwide and had a balance sheet of USD 600 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.37,0)">Its failure turned a large-scale crisis of confidence into a global financial panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.41,0)">Financial intermediaries restored liquidity buffers, tried to economise on capital and to scale down their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.8,0)">They sold assets and tightened lending conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.82,0)">Banks and other financial institutions drastically reduced their exposure to the risks that they had imprudently accumulated during the phase of financial euphoria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.61,0)">Financial intermediation and loans to companies were curtailed in the wake of a forceful process of “deleveraging”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.05,0)">This was the point when important spillovers of the financial crisis set in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We saw the almost immediate spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.73,0)">The credit squeeze and loss of confidence started to take a toll on the real economy, and a negative feedback loop developed between the financial sector and the real economy, and has since become a major feature of economic and financial developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Almost simultaneously, the crisis that originated in the advanced economies spilled over to the emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.05,0)">Since the fourth quarter of 2008, virtually all economies – both those of the industrialised countries and the emerging markets – have faced synchronised business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.91,0)">Since half a year, we are facing a highly synchronised global economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.26,0)">The ECB’s response to the financial crisis Turning to the ECB’s response to the crisis, let me first insist that none of my remarks should be interpreted in terms of the future course of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I stick rigorously to what I have said during my last press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.68,0)">We are indeed in the one-week “purdah period” before the next meeting of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.61,0)">Since the start of the financial turmoil, central banks around the globe face unprecedented challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">We at the ECB and other central banks have reacted swiftly, flexibly and decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The ECB took the lead with some exceptional decisions as early as 9 August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">We have, since then, modified our operational framework and used an exceptional set of non-standard policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">These tools, combined with the bold action taken by euro area governments over recent months, have played an essential role in preventing a collapse of the financial system and in bolstering confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">I would like to emphasise that despite this upheaval and our exceptional measures, our objective remains unchanged: to preserve price stability over the medium term, and that’s what guides our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In so doing, we support the conditions for financial and economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The crisis has not changed this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Interest rates As regards interest rates, the ECB’s Governing Council has reacted promptly and decisively to the intensification and broadening of the global financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.91,0)">We have lowered our key interest rate by 325 basis points since October 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.35,0)">This is the largest cut ever decided over such a short period in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These moves were fully in line with our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.39,0)">The upside risks to price stability have indeed receded considerably over that period due to the sharp fall in oil and other commodity prices, and the abrupt slowdown in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">As price stability is the needle in our compass, we took account of the easing of inflationary pressures and lowered interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In this context, I would like to underline that since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability – an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% in the euro area, over the medium term – has proved to be an invaluable asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.02,0)">It has guarded against undesirably high inflation and against deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, whether based on surveys or extracted from financial indicators, have been and continue to be firmly anchored at levels consistent with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Inflation expectations have been exceptionally resistant to sudden upward short-term price changes, and we have ensured that is also the case with sharply falling inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Non-standard measures In addition to reducing interest rates, we have taken exceptional policy actions in response to the crisis – ‘non-standard’ measures related to liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">At the very start of the money market stress in August 2007, the ECB reacted within a few hours and temporarily provided additional liquidity to banks with immediate liquidity needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We were in fact the first central bank to take non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">When in mid-September 2008 the crisis intensified and interbank trading came to a virtual halt, the ECB engaged in a new mode of liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">We started to provide refinancing well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our approach comprises three main ‘building blocks’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We significantly adapted our regular refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">We now follow a ‘fixed rate full allotment’ tender procedure and have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of, initially, up to six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This is an exceptional mode of operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">In normal times we auction a given amount of central bank credit and let competition between the bidders determine the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This unusual mode of operation implies that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Our second building block is the long list of assets that we take as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This list was already very long before the crisis, but we have extended it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Even before the financial crisis, this number was higher than for the other major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Following the changes to our operational framework in October last year, this number rose further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">All these non-standard measures have now been supplemented by further exceptional steps that the ECB’s Governing Council decided to take at its last meeting on 7 May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We will conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This will further lengthen the maturity at which we provide banks with liquidity at fixed rates and full allotment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">This move is consistent with the operations we have undertaken since October 2008 and it recognises the central role played by the banking system in the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The European Investment Bank   will become an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Access to the Eurosystem’s liquidity is a natural complement to the EIB’s financing initiatives and it will facilitate the accommodation by the EIB of additional demand for its lending programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Furthermore, the Governing Council decided in principle that the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">We expect to engage in a programme of around €60 billion that targets an important segment of the private securities market, which has been particularly affected by the financial market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Our primary concern when taking these decisions in recent months was to maintain the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I have described that as ‘enhanced credit support’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Furthermore, our very flexible liquidity management ensured that solvent banks did not get into difficulties because of liquidity constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Our response to the crisis has been carefully calibrated to the financial and economic structures of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In particular, we needed to bear in mind that the euro area’s financial system is predominantly bank-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Take the structures of private credit outstanding as an example: recourse to banks makes up more than 70% of non-equity external finance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.94,0)">By comparison, in the US the equivalent proportion is only around 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This reflects the fact that the US financial system is primarily market-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In the euro area, guaranteeing steady access to credit for households and companies largely means preserving the viability of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Banks play such a dominant role in our economy that it was appropriate to focus our non-standard measures on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This profound contrast in financial and economic structures explains the different responses by central banks to the crisis as exemplified by the approaches of the ECB and the Federal Reserve System of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We rely on different channels as regards the transmission of our policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.39,0)">But these variations do not reflect conflicting views on fundamental principles or objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On the contrary: given the different structures, the approaches need to be different to achieve the same objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Thus, I would strongly argue that central banks around the world are united in purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.86,0)">As I indicated before, the remarks I just made on the ECB’s response to the crisis did not contain any message concerning future monetary policy, and should not be interpreted as containing any such message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Emerging markets and Mediterranean economies in the global economy Today we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Bank Al-Maghrib.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is also an occasion to reflect on the role of the Mediterranean region, and on the role of emerging market economies in general in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The growing importance of these economies, including those in this area, has profound implications for the euro area and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I would like to share my thoughts with you on this phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.12,0)">The growing role of emerging market economies The global financial crisis is slowing the growth of the emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Only a year ago, some observers were still saying that these economies were likely to decouple from the downturn stemming from the advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.17,0)">Today it is obvious that this has not happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">Most emerging markets are affected by the crisis through real or financial channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.49,0)">Many sectors have been severely hit by the global turmoil, for instance, the automotive, textile, building and tourist industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.46,0)">In addition, remittances which, for many emerging markets, are an important source of revenue, are vulnerable to the downturn in host countries, even though they tend to be a relatively stable source of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">It is too early to say when emerging market economies will bottom out of the global financial crisis, but some recent data, particularly for Asia, are somewhat encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.41,0)">According to the latest IMF forecasts, world output will shrink by 1.3% and the advanced economies by no less than 3.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">However, GDP in emerging markets, though lower than in previous years, will still grow by 1.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Despite the crisis, the long-run prospects for emerging market economies remain bright.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Projections for long-term growth, based on demographic trends and models of capital accumulation and productivity, suggest that the emerging markets are likely to gain in global importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">A number of studies found startling results regarding the growth prospects for emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">According to one study, Brazil, Russia, India and China   could account for over half the size of today’s six largest industrialised economies from 2025 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">We have to prepare for a very profound structural rebalancing of world output during the next years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The world economy is changing profoundly, as so should its governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The creation and the recent reinforcement of the G20 and the enlargement to the G20 of the Financial Stability Board are milestones in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The rise of the emerging economies will also be reflected in the reforms of the international financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What are the specific implications of the growing role of emerging markets for the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The euro area has close links with emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In trade terms, the euro area is actually more open than other major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Our exports and imports of goods and services account for more than 40% of GDP, significantly more than in the United States or in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Emerging markets are important in trade: nine of 20 euro area’s main trading partners are emerging economies, with a share of more than 18% of exports and around 31% of imports in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The BRICs alone accounted for more than 12% of extra-euro area exports and more than 22% of extra-euro area imports in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The growing role of Mediterranean economies In the present context, which is very challenging, the Mediterranean region is one of the few in the world that will continue to grow this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The countries in this area have an increasingly important place among the world’s emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Moreover, the Mediterranean economies, and particularly the Maghreb countries, have close links to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For example, more than 50% of Morocco’s imports and exports are with the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Within the Mediterranean region, labour and product markets have become more flexible, the financial sector is now on a more solid footing and the economy has become more business-friendly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">A continuation of these reforms will help to increase the long-run growth potential of the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">A continued implementation of such reforms would lay the foundation for an increase in the long-run growth potential in the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Central banks and monetary policy frameworks are frontrunners in this reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In that respect, Morocco is an excellent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Important progress has been made towards introducing an inflation targeting framework, which is the medium-term objective of Bank Al-Maghrib.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The bank’s new statutes promulgated in February 2006 confirmed its independence in the conduct of monetary policy and enshrined price stability as its primary objective mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As you know, the Eurosystem attaches greatest importance to cooperating with central banks of emerging market economies, including those in the Mediterranean region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The ECB, as the central bank of the world’s second largest integrated economy, very closely monitors economic developments in regions nearby, notably the Mediterranean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">As I said earlier, we have been working more closely in recent years by holding regular Euro-Mediterranean Seminars for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And further east, we have established a similar seminar with the governors of the Gulf Cooperation Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The group’s first meeting was held in Germany last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion To conclude, I would like to call your attention to the following points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">To start with, we are, for the first time, putting to the test the soundness and resilience of the globalised economy, which has become increasingly integrated over the past fifteen years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We now have to draw, systematically and without complacency, the lessons of the global crisis that we are fighting against.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Secondly, we have a duty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Our duty is to considerably reinforce the resilience of the global financial system and the soundness of the real global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.82,0)">We should not allow that, a few years from now, a new crisis would emerge that would be similar to the current one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.62,0)">That would be unforgivable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Thirdly, the international community has engaged in drawing all lessons from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We agree on the method, on the role of the G20, on the role of the Financial Stability Board, and on the role of international financial institutions, in particular the crucial role of the International Monetary Fund, and also of the Bank for International Settlements, which during the past years has shown remarkable lucidity in its analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As regards the global financial sector, we agree on the broad orientations to follow: to reduce procyclicality, to fight short-termism, and to impose transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.02,0)">Fourthly, we are still today in a very difficult and very unpredictable environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.86,0)">We permanently need to remain alert, and there is no place for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would have two main messages in that regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As concerns direct government support to the financial sector, today’s priority is “rapidity of execution.” Decisions that have already been taken should be implemented swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This holds true, in particular, for recapitalisation, as currently only 55% of funds earmarked for recapitalisation have been used in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In crisis times, rapid implementation is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As concerns global governance, I insist on the absolute necessity to reinforce macroeconomic policy surveillance of systematically important countries and economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The IMF has to play a fundamental role in such monitoring, coupled with responsible and active peer surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Finally, central banks have a fundamental role in ensuring monetary and financial stability from a long-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Morocco knows that it can count on the crucial contribution of Bank
