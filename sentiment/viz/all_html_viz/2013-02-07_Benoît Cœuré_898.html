    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> Monetary Policy and Banking Supervision Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Symposium: “Central Banking: Where Are We Headed?” in honour of Stefan Gerlach’s contribution to the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability,Goethe University, Frankfurt, 7 February 2013 The history of central banks and the European banking union   When we look at the history of central banks, contributing to financial stability was one of their roles in most countries, although to varying degrees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.15,0)">Even when central banks were assigned a relatively narrow mandate, such as that of inflation targeting in recent years, they often played a decisive part as soon as financial instability struck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In particular, their ability to act as lender of last resort in the financial system and to manage liquidity in the interbank market typically made them a key player in crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.06,0)">Even in normal times, the central role of bank deposits in the stock of money makes monetary stability dependent on the soundness of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In sum, in the late Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa’s words, financial stability has been part of the “genetic code” of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.0,0)">There have been many cases of lender-of-last-resort interventions by central banks during the present crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For example, when we compare the total emergency liquidity assistance   that euro area national central banks granted to individual credit institutions last summer with the overall amount of liquidity provided at the same time by the Eurosystem, we can see that the total ELA amounts to almost one-seventh.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Just to quote an example from here in Germany: the Bundesbank granted €35 billion of emergency liquidity assistance to the ailing bank Hypo Real Estate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">More generally, the experience of the last five years has underlined the importance of central banks in financial stability, a task which they have historically performed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">But central banks were not always and everywhere tasked with financial supervision, which aims to prevent crises from happening in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.93,0)">For example, before the present crisis the institutions responsible for banking supervision differed from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.16,0)">In fact, in the late 1990s there was a trend for financial supervision to be placed outside central banks and entrusted to cross-sectoral authorities in charge of banks, insurance and securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The crisis seems to have reversed this trend, as recent reforms in the US and Europe show.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.46,0)">Today, most Eurosystem governors are banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In December 2012 euro area finance ministers reached an agreement to create a Single Supervisory Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is currently under discussion with the European Parliament and it will give the ECB a bank supervisory role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">As a result of the crisis, there is a consensus that a European banking union involving the ECB is an important component to complete the Single Market for financial services and for a genuine Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Together with the other banking union components – common resolution and harmonised deposit insurance arrangements – this should help to overcome the fragmentation of money markets and break the vicious circle between financial and sovereign instability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Since the ECB has not been a bank supervisor and since its primary mandate is and will remain to conduct monetary policy and maintain price stability, it is time to consider how monetary policy and banking supervision are related.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I will do so in this speech, by first discussing the benefits a bank supervisory role could offer monetary policy – particularly in terms of informational advantages – and then by considering some design features, which are important when tackling the challenges of putting monetary policy and banking supervision under one roof.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">How monetary policy can benefit from integrating banking supervision in a central bank The banking union will strengthen the governance framework supporting the Single Market and EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">Obviously, its primary purpose is not to support monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In fact, as the short history of EMU suggests, price stability can be maintained without the ECB being responsible for banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">But integrating the SSM in the ECB also creates some new opportunities for the conduct of monetary policy and other functions closely related to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I particularly see four areas in this respect: the state of the macroeconomy; monetary policy options; interactions with supervisory policies; and the management of the central bank balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">I will argue that these opportunities are greater in turbulent times than in quiet times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Additional information about the financial sector and the state of the economy Data collected and analyses conducted as part of banking supervision provide valuable additional information about the banking sector and may feed into the assessment of the macroeconomic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">According to the proposed SSM regulation   it has been estimated that the SSM would directly supervise approximately 130 to 140 banks in the euro area countries, constituting more than 80% of total euro area bank assets, and well cover the banking sector in all these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This information could complement the data collected for the ECB’s monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy is based on two pillars, an economic one and a monetary one, and thereby assigns an important role to money and credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The broad range of tools regularly used in our monetary analysis already provides valuable information about the build-up and unravelling of widespread financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Additional supervisory data and analyses, be they micro-prudential or macro-prudential, would further enhance the breadth, depth and granularity of information about the functioning of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The value added of this information will become even more critical in a crisis, given the important role of banks in severe financial crises and the nature of the data concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Moreover, analytical supervisory assessment indicators and early-warning tools can put the new data to work in assessing credit developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Additional information on the banking sector is likely to be more important in the euro area than in the US, because in the euro area bank lending accounts for almost two-thirds of the total financing of non-financial corporations, whereas in the US bank lending is only just above one-quarter of total firm financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Broader information basis for assessing monetary policy options Given Europe’s bank-based financial structure, monetary transmission channels through the banking sector are particularly important in understanding the effects of monetary policy actions, standard and non-standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.81,0)">For example, a key feature of the present crisis is the impairment of the monetary transmission mechanism in which fragilities in banks’ funding models and their exposure to government debt have played a significant role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">A thorough understanding of banks’ behaviour and health across jurisdictions facilitates the design and implementation of non-standard monetary policy measures and will also facilitate the exit from these measures when the time is right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Better consideration of the interactions between monetary, supervisory and regulatory policies Monetary policy interacts with supervisory and regulatory policies, be they micro-prudential or macro-prudential in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">If the monetary policy objective and the supervisory objective are distinctly defined and separate instruments are assigned to each of them, then a single institution could take the interdependencies better into account than separate authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Interactions can be expected to occur in particular with macro-prudential policies, which increase in importance due to the lessons from the crisis, and operate through channels closely related to monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The allocation of macro-prudential regulatory instruments under the SSM is therefore an important design feature of the draft legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Research confirms that it is advisable for monetary policy to focus on price stability and prudential policy on financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Against this background, as an institution with a clear price stability mandate, compliance with which can be easily verified, the ECB will have incentives to intensify the prudential policies seeking to counteract emerging financial imbalances and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In turn, and importantly, this would reduce pressures on monetary policy to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">It will also have incentives to conduct supervisory policies in a way that would reduce the likelihood of crises and therefore of lender-of-last-resort interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.97,0)">This would also diminish the possibility of generating adverse incentives for banks, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.88,0)">moral hazard involved with emergency assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.67,0)">A single institution could also avoid conflicts and coordination problems between separate policy authorities, which might be particularly pronounced in a crisis and in a multi-country setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Better management of the creditworthiness of counterparties in monetary policy operations Monetary policy operations expose the central bank to credit   risks, which are controlled through adequate collateral and other risk management techniques.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Good banking supervision and prompt corrective action ensure the soundness of counterparties in these transactions and a central bank therefore has particular incentives to make sure its supervision is rigorous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Rigorous supervision, in turn, protects the central bank’s balance sheet and gives it greater control over it, also safeguarding the central bank’s independence and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is an important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As the central bank has a direct interest in strong supervision, the risk of financial dominance over monetary policy becomes less likely, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.41,0)">the risk that monetary policy operations could be increasingly dominated by the state of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.3,0)">This, in turn, reduces also the risk of fiscal dominance over monetary policy, which means the risk that fiscal behaviour forces monetary policy to react in ways that it otherwise would not do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.27,0)">As governments are always reluctant to fund unpopular bailouts or incur the social costs of bank insolvencies, they may prefer to rely on prolonged central bank liquidity provision to keep banks alive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What is crucial for adequate supervisory rigour is of course the independence of the supervisory function in the central bank, a point I will come back to later in this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In order to protect a central bank from regulatory forbearance, supervisory rigour is necessary on an ongoing basis, as is the determination to wind up failed banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">In turn, this requires the existence of orderly resolution mechanisms with an adequate financial backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will also come back to that point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Moreover, a central bank has an incentive to establish rigorous supervision since it would diminish the trade-offs between the need for tightening collateral requirements in downturns to protect its balance sheet and the need for relaxing these collateral requirements to stabilise banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.25,0)">The tightening of collateral requirements in downturns amplifies the pro-cyclicality of financial systems, while relaxing those requirements increases balance-sheet risks and distorts financial sector behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">When implementing the SSM in the ECB, we will make every effort to use these opportunities to the full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, we will seize these opportunities only to the extent that they do not create conflicts of interest, reputational risks or risks to the independence of the monetary policy authority, a point I’ll consider next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How to design monetary policy and banking supervision under one roof At least three types of challenges and risks need to be managed when integrating supervision in a central bank alongside monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.57,0)">They relate to potential conflicts of interest, reputational risks and central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.47,0)">Avoiding conflicts of interest The literature on whether adding banking supervision to monetary policy creates conflicts of interest is not well developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.29,0)">The concern is that a central bank which is also in charge of supervision would turn into a supervisor with access to central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.85,0)">As recently pointed out by Stefan Gerlach,   it could then occasionally relax its monetary policy, potentially generating an inflationary bias impairing its credibility, and also contribute to more risk-taking by banks  , and in turn breed future financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.14,0)">The central bank could in particular be inclined to continue lending to weak banks for fear that winding them up would trigger losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Although this literature is not conclusive, we take such concerns extremely seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To protect against such effects both the regulation proposed by the European Commission and the ECB’s Opinion on this regulation call for a governance structure that strictly separates the monetary functions from the supervisory functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This should entail a separation of the decision-making bodies, including procedures to strictly limit the ECB Governing Council’s involvement in supervisory decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It should also include distinct objectives for the decision-making bodies and different policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Eijffinger and Nijskens, for example, recently pointed out that the assignment of separate instruments to the two policy branches would solve potential conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.0,0)">There is one situation in which the distinction between supervisory and some monetary policy instruments is less clear cut, namely, in the case of certain non-standard monetary policy actions in the midst of a financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.81,0)">However, in such a situation, the outlook for the economy and prices has considerable downside risks, so the direction of financial stability and price stability actions   typically go in the same direction and a conflict between both policy branches is rather unlikely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The draft legislation also confirms that the other statutory tasks and objectives of the ECB remain unaffected by the SSM, implying that monetary policy will continue to be conducted by the Governing Council in full independence, with the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">With our quantitative definition of price stability, it will be easy to verify every month that inflation expectations remain well anchored, as they are today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.69,0)">It is hard to see how financial stability dominance over monetary policy could occur if such precautions are taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">At the same time, in order to exploit the advantages that I was discussing before, it is necessary to put in place mechanisms that allow an adequate flow of data and   analyses between the two functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of course, this flow of information should not weaken in any form the necessary separation in decision-making, objectives and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In short, separation does not mean isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Managing reputational risks In order to ensure the success of banking supervision, competencies and policy instruments need to be assigned to the new SSM which would allow it to perform its tasks effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.06,0)">Otherwise, reputational risks could arise that might negatively affect the institution as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The current draft legislation would grant the SSM an appropriate mixture of micro- and macro-prudential instruments for it to conduct supervision effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, on the micro-prudential side it would have all the relevant powers, ranging from bank authorisation to administrative sanctions, from the control of capital levels to compensation issues, through to structural issues such as business models and mergers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.12,0)">But even if bank supervisors use their powers effectively, this does not imply that there will never be any bank failures, fraud or other highly visible negative events, which could affect the decision-makers’ reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.36,0)">This is another challenge in the business of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This residual reputational risk should also be managed through an appropriate separation of responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Beyond the internal functional separation this should be fostered through a corresponding separation in external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Chair and Vice-Chair of the envisaged ECB Supervisory Board will play an important role in communicating publicly and reporting to the European Parliament, as will the heads of the national supervisory agencies belonging to the SSM in their respective jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.77,0)">Ensuring central bank independence Bank failures and financial fraud often affect small savers or have an impact on public budgets, and lead to the involvement of democratically elected governments and Parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.04,0)">While indeed, the highest standard of democratic accountability needs to be ensured, history shows that political interference can also constrain the effectiveness of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.39,0)">In particular, if there is political interference to avoid costly bank restructurings or closures and it undermines supervisory rigour, then the beneficial effects in terms of control over the central bank’s balance sheet and the avoidance of financial or fiscal dominance risks might not accrue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.05,0)">There should therefore be a strict separation between the supervisor and a resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Against this background it is reassuring that the transfer of supervisory responsibilities to the SSM will not have any implications for the independence of the ECB in performing all its tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.46,0)">By implication, the necessary internal precautions against political interference in supervisory matters adversely affecting the ECB’s independence in conducting monetary policy have been taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">But further external precautions need to be taken to ensure that financial and fiscal dominance risks do not threaten the independence of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">A crucial point in this context is the existence of a well-functioning European bank resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Such an outside mechanism provides further protection for the central bank’s balance sheet and its monetary policy independence, and has a twofold objective: first, it aims to limit the residual risk to governments’ balance sheets, in particular through the timely implementation of bail-in instruments, so that the risk of financial dominance is not compounded by a risk of fiscal dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, it aims to ensure a strict separation between supervision and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">2013 will be a key year for Europe to make progress with this second leg of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">Concluding remarks Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is essential for Europe to introduce the different elements of the banking union as soon as possible, starting with the SSM involving the ECB, and promptly continuing with a separate bank resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This will not only contribute to the integrity of the euro area and the completion of EMU, but also has some benefits for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The current draft legislative framework proposed by the European Commission and the preparatory work done by the ECB, the national central banks and competent supervisory authorities on implementing the SSM also takes a forward-looking approach to handling the challenges of integrating banking supervision in a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This will make sure that the SSM achieves its objectives; that the desirable synergies between banking supervision and monetary policy   are realised; and that the primary objective of monetary policy to maintain price stability is fully respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To achieve this objective, three conditions should be met: the internal governance of the ECB should strictly separate the two functions; the architecture of the banking union should provide for a separate, common resolution mechanism as soon as possible; and the ECB as a supervisor should not hesitate to enforce capital and liquidity regulations, recognise losses in the banking system and identify failed banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Price stability will remain the only needle of our compass for conducting monetary policy in the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">If we implement the SSM well, taking advantage of the opportunities and carefully addressing the challenges, we have a good chance of further improving our ability to conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">I wish to thank Philipp Hartmann for his key contribution to this
