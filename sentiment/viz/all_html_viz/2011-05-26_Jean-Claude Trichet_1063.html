    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> The ECB’s response to the crisis Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the WDR Europa-Forum,Berlin, 26 May 2011 Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, ich freue mich sehr, heute hier zu sein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Vielen herzlichen Dank für die Einladung.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Ich freue mich besonders, zu einem so wichtigen Thema – der europäischen Antwort auf die Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise – zu sprechen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">* * * Wie Sie wissen, ist das primäre Mandat der EZB, für Preisstabilität im Eurogebiet zu sorgen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So ist es von den Europäischen Staats- und Regierungschefs in den Verträgen zur Europäischen Union 1992 festgeschrieben worden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Und dementsprechend strebt der EZB-Rat eine mittelfristige Inflationsrate von unter, aber nahe bei 2% an.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Die EZB ist diesem Mandat in den vergangenen zwölf Jahren gerecht geworden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Die jährliche Teuerungsrate betrug über diesen Zeitraum im Eurogebiet 1.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In Deutschland lag sie mit 1.5% seit 1999 sogar noch deutlich darunter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Für Deutschland ist dies das beste Ergebnis über einen vergleichbaren Zeitraum seit 50 Jahren mit der D-Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">„Stark wie die Mark“ sollte der Euro sein – und stark wie die Mark ist er geworden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It is important to understand the significance of this achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Over the past 12 years, the ECB has faced many challenges in the pursuit of our goal of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.36,0)">They include the bursting of the internet bubble, the aftermath of 11 September 2001, sharp volatility in commodity prices and of course the worst financial crisis since World War II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Today I would like to focus specifically on our response to the crisis – and on the programmes of reform of financial regulation and economic governance on which the euro area and the European Union as a whole are engaged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">While there is no doubt of the scale of the challenge that the crisis has posed for all advanced economies, including the US and Japan, there is also no doubt that we have taken significant measures in responding to that challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But much more needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Financial and economic reform prompted by the crisis Let me begin with financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The crisis calls for a comprehensive agenda of reform of virtually every aspect of the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We must control the forces that led the system to become absorbed with itself and ensure instead that it serves the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">And we must be assured that the financial system provides a sustainable contribution to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">At this point, we have achieved a blueprint of more stringent bank regulations, which includes more loss-absorbing capital, better risk coverage and limitations on undue leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Countercyclical capital buffers are intended to lower pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The oversight of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure are being strengthened, and the organisational structure of financial supervision is being overhauled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.71,0)">But much remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The most important aspect is implementation of these reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Moreover, the issue of systemically important financial institutions still requires decisions, and oversight of financial markets must be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.16,0)">We cannot afford the consequences of limited transparency and excessive influence of dominant players and oligopolistic market structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The new European System of Financial Supervision is an important step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The three new European Authorities – for banking, for insurance and occupational pensions, and for securities and markets – are strengthening our focus on interlinkages and spillovers within the EU’s financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And the European Systemic Risk Board is developing the tools it needs to issue warnings and make recommendations for action on potential future sources of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.08,0)">Inattention to financial risk was the prime cause of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.49,0)">Inattention to macroeconomic risk – and the many ways in which such risk interacts with fragile fiscal structures – prepared the ground for the budgetary troubles that some euro area countries are facing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This brings me to reform of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The EU is about to introduce surveillance focused on imbalances and divergences in competitiveness across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is long overdue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.52,0)">Since 2005 within the Eurogroup and – shortly thereafter – publicly, the ECB has warned that such divergences create considerable risks and must be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">If fully implemented, macroeconomic surveillance will make a strong contribution to the smooth functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.73,0)">It will compel Member States to take measures to counter emerging macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage, before they become a drag on their macroeconomic prospects and potentially escalate to systemic proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Governments had agreed on the Stability and Growth Pact to prevent a debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">But in 2005 the Member States agreed on a reform of the Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">At the request of Germany and France, more discretion and flexibility was added to the surveillance procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.88,0)">This turned out to be to the detriment of the Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.37,0)">It weakened the Pact considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.74,0)">At that time, the ECB expressed serious concerns about the negative effect of these reforms on the functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It is important that Member States have acknowledged this mistake and intend to strengthen the Pact again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The new focus on fiscal sustainability and reducing government debt levels, backed by more effective sanctions, certainly goes in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The euro is unique among international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is the only major currency that is issued not by a single sovereign state but by a union of states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments and reflect national political preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.83,0)">Monetary policy is inherently indivisible in a monetary union, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.28,0)">The current crisis is not a crisis of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">Neither is it a crisis of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.8,0)">Rather, it is a crisis of the economic policies in some Member States and a crisis of mutual surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.94,0)">If we recall that EMU stands for Economic and Monetary Union, it is not the monetary pillar of EMU that is under scrutiny at present, but the economic pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.88,0)">Speaking in terms of letters, the “E” and not the “M” in EMU is giving cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.93,0)">Our economic governance framework has not been sufficient to ensure sound policies are conducted in all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The Treaty clearly specifies that Member States have committed to economic policies geared to contributing to the objectives of the Union, one of which is a stable single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">They have yet to live up to this commitment fully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.22,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB is concerned that the reforms to economic governance currently under discussion are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough to address the structural weaknesses of fiscal and broader macroeconomic governance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">At the very least, we require more automaticity in the sanctioning mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.12,0)">Euro area countries that are breaching our common rules should be called to account, with as little room for discretion and flexibility as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.12,0)">This implies less room for halting or suspending procedures and stricter deadlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Behind this we argue in favour of stronger sanctions to encourage compliance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.0,0)">This would require, on the one hand, a wider range of financial and non-financial measures, and on the other hand, less discretion to reduce or suspend them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Such a strengthening would improve effectiveness and set the right incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">At the same time, more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This means having ambitious benchmarks when establishing an excessive deficit and when setting the adjustment path towards a “safe” budgetary position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is very important for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the countries with the greatest vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.65,0)">Anchoring these new rules at the national level would forcefully anchor them in national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Binding commitments by Member States to implement strong national budgetary frameworks are key to ensuring national ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Finally, further improvements in the production of fiscal statistics are in our view warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.64,0)">These are all areas in which the ECB is presenting arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the end, these matters are decided by the Council and the Parliament, and they have therefore the key responsibility in shaping the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB’s response to the crisis Let me now turn to my final topic – the “M” in EMU, which is the direct responsibility of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.35,0)">During the crisis, along with central banks around the world, the ECB has had to operate in uncharted waters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">When the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">While the crisis required fast and unprecedented action we have never lost sight of our primary objective: to maintain price stability over the medium term for the 331 million citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">All – and I emphasise all – our monetary policy decisions during the past twelve and a half years have aimed at delivering on that commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">As you know, in normal times central banks mainly influence the economy and inflation through the setting of short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In practice, identifying risks to price stability at an early stage is far from trivial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">To accomplish this task the ECB relies on a robust monetary policy strategy that draws on several sources of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Economic analysis allows us to synthesise information on short-term inflationary pressures from a multitude of economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary analysis allows us to cross-check this information with information on medium-term inflationary pressures extracted from monetary and financial indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is on this basis that we decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance and adjust interest rates accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Our positive track record has endorsed our approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Over the past twelve and a half years we have built a strong reputation for setting interest rates as appropriate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Our decisions in the face of political pressure have demonstrated our fierce independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.86,0)">We refused to decrease rates at the beginning of 2004 when Germany, France and Italy, in particular, asked us to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We did not hesitate to raise interest rates in December 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.2,0)">At that point, ten euro area governments out of 12 and many international observers pressured us to keep rates on hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The IMF, for example, was emphasising the risks that tightening – after a prolonged period of policy accommodation – could pose for the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">We tightened policy despite these warnings, and we were vindicated – by the IMF’s own admission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">We also did not hesitate to raise interest rates in July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.62,0)">Then, our analysis indicated that past oil price increases threatened to create second-round effects on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.64,0)">After the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008, as inflationary pressures receded, in full consistency with our mandate, we decided to reduce our policy interest rate rapidly between October 2008 and May 2009, from 4.25% to 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.69,0)">We reduced the interest rate to a level and at a pace that has not been experienced in the countries of the euro area at any time in recent history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, the interest rate decisions we took during the crisis have proved successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Over the past four years we have maintained a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Our determination to preserve price stability in the medium term has allowed us to avoid the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as of the risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In most recent months, with the overall recovery more firmly established, we have witnessed the emergence of upside risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Once more, strong increases in oil and other commodity prices have had a strong impact on headline inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.88,0)">Once more, we have to avoid commodity price increases becoming entrenched in longer-term inflation expectations, which could have second-round effects on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is against this background that the Governing Council decided to raise interest rates in April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And I would like to emphasise that this decision was unanimous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Governing Council is united by a common purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">We are carefully monitoring the situation and we stand ready to do whatever is necessary to fulfil our mandate – just as we have done over the past twelve and a half years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This logic applies not only to our policy interest rate but also to the other measures we have adopted in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.97,0)">When the crisis hit, dysfunctional financial markets threatened our ability to steer the outlook for price stability with our standard interest rate instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In response, we adopted a number of non-standard measures to ensure that our interest rate decisions were transmitted to the broader economy, despite the problems in the financial sector and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In particular, the aim has been to enable banks – at any level of the monetary policy interest rate – to continue lending to household and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Let me emphasise that our non-standard measures do not in any way impinge on our capacity to tighten our monetary policy stance in response to inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There is a clear separation principle between our non-standard measures and our interest rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Interest rate policy depends on the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.02,0)">The use of non-standard measures depends on the functioning of the monetary policy transmission and must be commensurate with the level of malfunctioning or disruption of money and financial markets and segments of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">This separation principle is strictly applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To give you a recent example, the Governing Council decided in March and April both that it was now time to increase interest rates and, at the same time, that it was appropriate to maintain in the second quarter the full allotment at fixed price refinancing on a 3 month duration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Damit komme ich zum Schluss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Die Krise hat den Euroraum vor große Herausforderungen gestellt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Aber wir haben diese Herausforderungen angenommen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Der Euro hat sich als Stabilitätsanker in stürmischer   Davon haben alle – ich betone, alle – Länder des Euroraums profitiert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Bei alledem sollten wir nicht übersehen, dass der Euroraum als Ganzes in den vergangenen zwölf Jahren erhebliche Fortschritte gemacht hat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Die wirtschaftliche Dynamik im Euroraum hat derjenigen in den Vereinigten Staaten in nichts nachgestanden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In beiden Regionen ist das Pro-Kopf-Einkommen im Jahresdurchschnitt um etwa 1% gestiegen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Dabei hat der Euroraum deutlich mehr Beschäftigung geschaffen als die Vereinigten Staaten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Im Euroraum als Ganzes ist die Beschäftigung in den vergangenen zwölf Jahren um mehr als 14 Millionen gestiegen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In den Vereinigten Staaten betrug der Anstieg 8 Millionen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Und all das haben wir erreicht vor dem Hintergrund von Inflationserwartungen im Eurogebiet, die auf einem niedrigen Niveau verankert sind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Dies ist eine mehr als beachtliche Bilanz.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Ich kann Ihnen versichern, dass die Europäische Zentralbank auch in Zukunft ihren Teil zum reibungslosen Funktionieren der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion beitragen wird: wir werden ohne Wenn und Aber die Preisstabilität sichern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.</span>
