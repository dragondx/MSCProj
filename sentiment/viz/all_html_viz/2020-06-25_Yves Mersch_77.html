    <span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)"> 25 June 2020 The World Economy Transformed Remarks by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee Webinar Series The ECB’s immediate response to the coronavirus   shock was crucial in maintaining market functioning and the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It cushioned the drop in activity and prevented a downward spiral in financial markets, thus dispelling tail risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Price stability remains the focus of our policy measures, and this currently involves supporting the recovery, which is shrouded in an exceptional degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.29,0)">Existing macroeconomic models are ill-suited to forecasting the evolution of the pandemic and assessing its economic impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.93,0)">This is evident from the most recent Eurosystem projections, which are based on three scenarios that significantly differ in terms of the scale of the economic fallout.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We have designed our policy measures to be proportionate to such high levels of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The inherent flexibility within the constrained framework of the pandemic emergency purchase programme   allows us to adapt purchase flows to crisis contingencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In particular, the adjustable purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions ensure the PEPP’s effectiveness as a backstop for market stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">At the same time, we would not need to make use of the full PEPP envelope if the Governing Council were to assess that market tensions had eased sufficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The sheer size of the PEPP also goes beyond its primary backstop function by providing additional support to the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Monthly flows under the PEPP help to close the medium-term inflation gap created by the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.74,0)">But in the long run, this flexibility should not undermine the safeguards and limits we have set in our purchase programmes to respect the constitutional red lines that monetary policy cannot cross and that contain risks of monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On account of its flexibility, the PEPP must remain a temporary crisis instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The public sector purchase programme  , which follows pre-set monthly flows in accordance with the capital key, will continue to be the main instrument of our policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The issue share and issuer limits under this instrument remains in place to mitigate the risk of the ECB becoming a dominant creditor of euro area governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.26,0)">Notwithstanding such safeguards, we are mindful that the size of our balance sheet – the significant stock of acquired assets and reinvestments of the maturing principal payments – can have implications for market functioning and price formation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">While the short-term economic impact of the crisis is substantial and requires ample monetary policy support, the longer-term outlook is much less certain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.38,0)">It depends in particular on the extent to which the effects of the crisis exert prolonged pressure on supply and demand conditions, and on the strength and speed of fiscal and structural policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.08,0)">Fragmenting world trade is likely to redirect the focus of supply chains from short-term efficiency to increased resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">This will lead to a shortening of supply chains and a reshoring of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">At the same time, a surge in corporate indebtedness could make firms riskier and weigh on their capacity for investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">While these combined effects could act as a brake on productivity growth, they can be effectively offset if firms and policymakers use this crisis to modernise our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This includes promoting the digital transformation and refocusing supply chains to fully exploit the allocative efficiency offered by the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.17,0)">Such reform efforts will be crucial to smooth the sectoral reallocation which could result from the damage that even mild distancing measures inflict on labour-intensive service sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.81,0)">While a countercyclical fiscal push can help sustain aggregate demand in the transition, fiscal space may not be available in the countries most affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Policymakers should therefore use the current window of opportunity and create levers at the European level to reduce the risk of individual countries emerging from the crisis excessively scarred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The European Commission’s proposal for a major recovery plan, including the largest joint issuance in euro to date, is seen as a major step towards increasing the resilience of our union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">If decision-makers can ensure that all countries emerge from the crisis stronger, with more modern and dynamic economies, the recovery will be stronger and more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This would reduce the burden on monetary policy and the need for further easing of the policy stance.</span>
