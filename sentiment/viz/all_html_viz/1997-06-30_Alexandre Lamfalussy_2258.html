    <h3> Speaker: Alexandre Lamfalussy </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)"> Farewell address Address given by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy on the occasion of the change of presidency of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt am Main on 30 June 1997 The moment has come for me to say a heartfelt "thank you" to you all!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">I should like to express my gratitude, first of all, to the governors of the central banks of the European Union, who, in the autumn of 1993, chose me as their candidate for the presidency of the European Monetary Institute, thereby setting in train a process which has allowed me to play a part in a ground-breaking enterprise of exceptional scope and responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I should like to thank them, secondly, in their capacity as members of the EMI Council, for their co-operation in this undertaking and for their wisdom, prudence, willingness to compromise but also their will to achieve results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">They have invariably acted with the utmost professionalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I should like to add that we should not have been able to achieve what has been done without the conviction - which each of us shares - that the first duty of a central bank is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This fundamental principle has never been a matter of dispute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">My thanks go next to the political authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">First, to the Heads of State or of Government, who did me the honour of putting their faith in me in appointing me President of the EMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Second, to the Finance Ministers, who resigned themselves gracefully to the existence of an institution which would be independent of the executive and who played their part, with consummate political skill, in establishing the good working atmosphere between the ECOFIN and the EMI, in the mutual respect of our respective competences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">I hope that this will be an enduring legacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Thanks go, too, to the European Commission, with which we have been able - after a little trial and error, and with both sides demonstrating good will and a certain ability to listen - to draw up the rules of the game for the indispensable co-operation which is needed to enable the project of Economic and Monetary Union to go ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The European Parliament - and several national parliaments - have given me the opportunity to report on the work of the EMI, in an atmosphere of constructive dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Their questions and concerns, as well as those of the media and of the large number of associations from both the banking and financial sphere as well as society at large, have given me valuable insights into the expectations and concerns of our fellow citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">These thanks would not be complete without my expressing publicly what I have already had the opportunity to say in private to the members of the management and staff of the European Monetary Institute: without their personal commitment, their spirit of innovation, their boundless ability to find the happy medium - and not just a practical compromise between the concerns of our central banks - nothing would have been accomplished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What can I say to you now by way of farewell?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.5,0)">There is little point in giving you the "final score" at this stage - the match is not over yet...</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Recommendations on how to cope with the challenges which are looming on the horizon?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.91,0)">You will deal with them effectively, I am convinced, without my advice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">But perhaps you will accept some reflections on the ability - and the limits - of monetary policy to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens who, while appreciating the confirmation   of price stability, are looking for stronger growth and, above all, more jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I share their concern unreservedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">The current level of unemployment in the majority of our countries is ethically unacceptable; it is leading to the erosion of the social fabric and, because of the waste it represents, it is a clear signal that the economy is not functioning properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Reducing unemployment must be the prime objective of action by the authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.26,0)">But what should be the role of monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.83,0)">In view of the short time available to me - plus the fact that you cannot contradict me - I shall be brief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.73,0)">You may perhaps feel that I am being dogmatic: if so, please bear with me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.9,0)">I should like to make four observations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">There is no doubt whatsoever that monetary policy can bring inflation under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.66,0)">When monetary policy is not flanked by the appropriate budgetary policy, and when labour markets - but also goods and services markets - are not flexible, bringing inflation under control will take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.65,0)">It will take time, and it can also entail costs - which could otherwise have been avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But even so, these costs would still be less than the   cost of not dealing with inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.72,0)">Let us not forget that while the rich and the powerful can protect themselves from any loss of purchasing power of their money - and in many cases can even benefit from such a loss - the weak and the not-so-rich will always be the losers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.43,0)">Inflation has always been a major source of social iniquity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.6,0)">In addition, it prevents the economy from functioning properly, by falsifying the signals which are given by prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.74,0)">The speculative boom in the real estate markets in some of our countries at the end of the 1980s caused serious damage - and we are still paying the price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Once inflation has been brought under control, and once this control has been confirmed, monetary policy can guide short-term interest rates to a level which contributes to balanced growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.06,0)">Quite a number of EU countries are in such a situation already, with short-term interest rates at around 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In others, where inflation has been brought under control more recently, rates have not yet reached this level but are approaching it gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.94,0)">The confirmation that inflation has been brought under control does, unfortunately, take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Finally, in one major country which has seen rapid growth for several years now and in which unemployment has fallen remarkably, short-term interest rates have been raised - applying the principle of preventive medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Now, what can we say about long-term interest rates, which also have an important role to play in stimulating growth - perhaps an even more important one than short-term rates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy does have an influence on the level of these rates, but its influence is not exclusive and we cannot even predict the direction of its influence with certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.53,0)">At this particular point in time, in the first group of countries to which I referred a moment ago, nominal long-term interest rates are at a historically low level - they are well below 6% - but real long-term interest rates can be regarded, perhaps, as still being too high to put continental Europe on the road to more vigorous growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I am doubtful whether a further easing of monetary policy in this group of countries would be able to help move the yield curve in the desired direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.5,0)">It could actually have the opposite effect - if investors perceived it as heralding a weak euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.55,0)">In any event, given the current level of short-term interest rates, monetary policy's margin for manoeuvre is extremely limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is possible that the level of real long-term interest rates in Europe reflects, partially at least, that of real interest rates world-wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.55,0)">Europe has no influence over that effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Europe can, however, have an influence on the effect which comes from the constant increase in public sector indebtedness in our countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a reminder, between the end of 1991 and the end of 1996 the general government debt rose from around 56 to above 73% of GDP for the European Union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.03,0)">This development, together with the worry that it might not yet have run its course, are not likely - to say the least - to lead to a fall in real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Nor do they create the climate of confidence necessary for consumers and investors to modify their current prudent behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the other hand, the certainty that governments are tackling the underlying causes of the public deficits which are responsible for the constant increase in the debt burden could well bring about such a change in behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">"Faceless" markets are not the only ones looking beyond the immediate present to the future - our fellow citizens are, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The prospect of self-perpetuating, ever-increasing deficits will not encourage them to spend more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Stronger growth would certainly have a beneficial effect on employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.89,0)">But it would not eliminate the largest component of unemployment - the structural component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This can only be done by means of measures which remedy labour market rigidities and reduce the burden of non-wage labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is this latter channel that links efforts to create jobs with the task of bringing public expenditure under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.71,0)">I observe, too, that in those countries where unemployment has fallen substantially, jobs have been created not by existing enterprises - and especially not by large enterprises - but by the setting-up of a large number of new enterprises, which have necessarily been small to begin with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To conclude - allow me, if you will, to be quite blunt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Yes, once inflation has been brought properly under control, monetary policy can and must contribute to supporting balanced growth, but balanced growth will not depend on monetary policy alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Both the acceleration and the viability of growth will rely on the contribution to be made by other policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">First, on that of a fiscal policy which does not crowd out private investment but, rather, fosters a climate of confidence by implementing a credible process of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Second, on that of a policy which creates a favourable fiscal, financial and regulatory environment for the proliferation of new enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.18,0)">And, so that the growth fostered in this way can create many jobs, structural policies will have to assume the principal role, while the role of monetary policy will then dwindle and fade away - alas - to nothing.</span>
