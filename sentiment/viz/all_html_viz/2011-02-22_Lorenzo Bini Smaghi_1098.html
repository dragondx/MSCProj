    <span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)"> Eurozone, European crisis & policy responses Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Goldman Sachs Global Macro Conference - Asia 2011, Hong Kong, 22 February 2011 Introduction   Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this distinguished gathering here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We are certainly living in ‘interesting times’, as the Chinese say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.79,0)">Slightly ‘too interesting, for too long’ I would add.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.64,0)">Over the past few years, we have all witnessed a global financial crisis, which has caused profound changes in the outlook for the global financial system and global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.03,0)">This morning, I will focus on one manifestation of the broader financial turmoil: the sovereign debt crisis experienced by some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In my remarks, I will first discuss the origins of this crisis, and then draw some comparisons with the emerging market experience – particularly in Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After reviewing how the European authorities have responded to the crisis, I will conclude with some remarks on the outlook for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">While we certainly face considerable challenges at present, I am confident that Europe will emerge stronger from the current episode, not least because some of the existing gaps in the institutional framework for Economic and Monetary Union   will be filled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In the end, this will make the whole structure more stable and robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Origins of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe It is striking that those countries which experienced the European sovereign debt crisis in 2010 – notably Greece and Ireland – were among the best performers in terms of growth in economic activity within the European Union   over the decade preceding the crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Indeed, Ireland was called the ‘Celtic Tiger’, drawing a parallel with the fast-growing ‘Asian Tigers’ in earlier decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.04,0)">While prima facie a paradox, the relationship between strong pre-crisis growth and the severity of the crisis itself reveals much about the origins of the underlying economic, structural and institutional weaknesses that lie at the heart of recent events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">The introduction of the euro in 1999 led to a sharp fall in real interest rates especially in the so-called peripheral countries of the euro area, as nominal interest rates converged to low German levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In addition, the credibility of monetary policy’s commitment to maintain price stability was bolstered by the institutional changes associated with Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The resulting improvements to the growth outlook were further supported by the completion and deepening of the EU Single Market and the prospect of structural reforms underpinning national competitiveness in this integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In this context, the outlook for income growth in the peripheral countries was widely believed to have been transformed for the better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As a consequence, demand for credit expanded rapidly: households and firms in the periphery sought to borrow, so as to reap the available growth opportunities via investment and enjoy the benefits of prospective wealth gains immediately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This surge in the demand for borrowing was met with a relaxation of the credit supply  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Financing conditions eased significantly as real rates fell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Country risk premia diminished, as peripheral countries adopted a credible and stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.03,0)">Spreads between government bond yields of euro area countries narrowed to very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Financial institutions could borrow more easily abroad, as currency risk diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Deeper and more integrated capital markets facilitated greater opportunities for cross-country diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">And greater competition spurred rapid adoption of financial innovations, with securitisation and risk transfer markets playing an important catalytic role in expanding the loan supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Credit growth surged dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">No doubt part of the rapid expansion of credit was justified on fundamental grounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">After all, studies by the European Commission during the 1980s and 1990s had promised a sizable growth dividend from the Single Market and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">But, in an environment of large-scale structural change in peripheral economies and their financial systems, distinguishing the impact of improved fundamentals from that of ‘bubble-like’ behaviour proved a formidable challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.52,0)">Indeed, with the considerable benefit of hindsight, there can be little doubt that a significant component of credit growth served to create and nourish financial and economic imbalances that have ultimately proved unsustainable, most notably in the housing market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Where mortgages had once been scarce or expensive, they became cheap and readily available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">House prices boomed  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.47,0)">Institutional and psychological factors fuelled an asset price bubble in real estate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Supported by the dynamism of the real estate market, the peripheral economies grew rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.14,0)">But the growth achieved was not balanced: sectors of the economy associated with the housing boom – construction and financial services – grew disproportionately  , drawing resources away from other activities, raising concentrations in loan books and increasing macroeconomic vulnerability to sector-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Rapid economic growth led to increased demand for imports, while strong wage growth put pressure on the price competitiveness of the tradable sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.57,0)">Large deficits on the current account of the balance of payments therefore emerged  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.85,0)">Inflows of financial capital from abroad – the proverbial ‘hot money’ – were needed to finance the current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.82,0)">Such unbalanced growth also had important consequences for the fiscal accounts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The housing boom   increased tax revenues, dramatically in some cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">These ‘windfall’ increases in tax revenue were treated as structural rather than cyclical in nature, as the housing boom was prolonged and appeared to survive the cyclical weakness in activity in mid-decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.24,0)">In Greece, tax windfalls allowed successive governments to obscure a fundamental weakness in the fiscal system, which was only later revealed when the public accounts statistics were improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In Ireland, the windfalls supported the implementation of a pro-cyclical fiscal policy, as governments used revenue strength to justify tax reductions and higher public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.08,0)">Massive implicit liabilities towards the financial sector were accumulated as banking sectors grew rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.55,0)">Ultimately, the real and financial imbalances created by these dynamics proved to be unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.01,0)">The global financial crisis in 2007-08 was the crucial triggering event  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.33,0)">First, the onset of global recession led to a deterioration in growth performance, rendering the fiscal and financial burdens imposed by past behaviour unsupportable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.57,0)">Second, the financial tensions led to a disruption of domestic financial intermediation, with severe consequences for both private and public financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.0,0)">In Greece, the banks – which were reasonably strong in a ‘stand-alone’ sense – were undone by revelations about the weakness of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.23,0)">In Ireland, causation ran in the opposite direction: the bloated and failing domestic banking system imposed an intolerable burden on what, prior to the crisis, had been a superficially strong fiscal position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.48,0)">Regardless of the causation, the consequences were the same: as confidence eroded, the inflow of foreign capital dried up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.47,0)">Subject to a ‘sudden stop’ in external financing,   the European sovereign debt crisis – itself inextricably linked with problems in the financial sector – erupted, forcing Greece and Ireland to seek financial assistance from the European Union and IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What can we learn from the emerging market crises of the past thirty years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The developments I have just described might give those of you living in emerging economies a sense of déjà vu.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.29,0)">And indeed it has become commonplace to draw comparisons between recent events in Europe and the periodic financial crises seen in emerging market economies   over the past three decades: Latin America’s debt crisis in the 1980s; the Mexican tequila crisis of 1994; the Asian financial crisis in the second half of the 1990s; and the Argentine crisis of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Extensive economic literature has analysed these events and identified important roles for many of the phenomena I have just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is therefore useful to explore parallels between the emerging market experience and what we are currently seeing in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Here in Hong Kong, it is natural to focus on the Asian experience in the mid- to late-1990s, although events in Latin America are also useful to bear in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To set the stage for a discussion of policy responses, allow me first to set out what I see as the key similarities and key differences between these episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Similarities between euro area and EME experiences The accumulation of financial imbalances and vulnerabilities prior to the crisis is an important feature of both the European and Asian experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Over-optimistic expectations of longer-term growth performance stimulated a surge in credit expansion and economic activity, associated with massive inflows of capital from abroad  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.01,0)">The risks associated with these capital inflows were under-appreciated by investors and therefore under-priced by markets, in part because the aggregate and systemic consequences of a ‘sudden stop’ in such flows were neglected in the decisions made by individual investors  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.02,0)">Rating agencies acted in a pro-cyclical manner, also failing to adequately assess systemic risk  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.39,0)">The inflationary consequences of strong growth led to a loss of competitiveness, as the real exchange rate appreciated  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.07,0)">The current account of the balance of payments shifted into deficit, creating a dependency on the inflow of foreign capital  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.67,0)">And the rapid pace of economic growth obscured the underlying weakness of public finances, in some cases abetted by creative accounting practices, such as shifting government liabilities off the balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The case of Ireland seems particularly close to Asia’s experience in the 1990s: while public finances appeared relatively strong, a vast external debt was being accumulated by the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.31,0)">The implicit government liabilities towards the financial sector arising from deposit insurance schemes and the need to manage systemic risks were neither fully recognised nor appropriately priced  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">By contrast, the Greek experience appears closer to that of Latin America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.18,0)">In these cases, fiscal indiscipline, in part initially obscured by creative accounting practices, lies at the heart of the accumulation of financial imbalances, rather than a build-up of external debt on bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Argentina’s crisis in 2001 is a case in point, although the experience was shared by many Latin American countries in the 1980s  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A further important similarity between the emerging market experience and that of the peripheral euro area countries is that the external debt is denominated in a currency which the national authorities do not completely control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.75,0)">In emerging markets, so-called ‘original sin’ – that is, a lack of credibility created by poor macroeconomic discipline in the past – implied that external debt was overwhelmingly denominated in US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the euro area, debt is denominated in euros.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.54,0)">Although this is obviously the currency of euro area countries, the single monetary policy aims at price stability across the euro area and thus cannot take account of national priorities deriving from fiscal or financial weaknesses in peripheral countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By implication, neither in the emerging markets nor in the euro area periphery can the real value of the external debt burden be eroded by inflation or devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.57,0)">Any attempt to devalue would simply raise the domestic burden of the external debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.49,0)">Of course, this was precisely the point: by issuing debt in a currency which they could not control, the national authorities in the euro area ‘tied their own hands’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Before the crisis, they obtained a credibility gain that would lower overall funding costs and thus reduced the probability of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But when a crisis occurs, the external value of the debt burden cannot be reduced by devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Differences between euro area and EME experiences While many of the experiences of the euro area periphery and the EMEs are similar, there are also important differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">First, in general terms, Europe is more advanced both economically and institutionally than Asia  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Advanced economies have higher ‘debt tolerance,’ because of their stronger institutions, a more favourable composition of debt and a more stable fiscal revenue base  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.24,0)">Thus while the dynamics of financial crises may be similar, the level of debt at which they occur may be different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, this can be a mixed blessing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The ability to accumulate more exposures may permit the pre-crisis boom to last longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.39,0)">But it may also mean that the subsequent downfall is deeper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The second difference is that, by having a national currency, even if it is rigidly pegged to an external anchor, as in the case of Argentina’s dollar currency board prior to 2001, the EMEs retain scope to devalue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">By contrast, the European periphery countries have adopted the euro; they no longer have a national currency and therefore can no longer devalue, at least against their main trading partners within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">Ruling out devaluation has pros and cons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On the one hand, the eradication of devaluation risk eliminates one element of financing costs that may rise rapidly in a financial crisis, even if the currency risk simply morphs into a credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.77,0)">Moreover, ruling out devaluation avoids ‘beggar-thy-neighbour’ competitive devaluations that can trigger trade wars and protectionism, and weaken the growth outlook  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.84,0)">And, without a devaluation option, peripheral euro area countries cannot fall into a vicious debt-devaluation spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.27,0)">Devaluation increases the real value of the outstanding foreign currency-denominated debt burden in domestic currency terms and may thus worsen the economic and fiscal outlook of a country under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.14,0)">Any resulting loss of market confidence may trigger further weakening of the domestic currency, thereby exacerbating the problem and creating a steady downward spiral of devaluation and rising debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">On the other hand, devaluation offers some scope to improve external price competitiveness and thus boost growth via better export performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The benefits of any such devaluation will be greater for countries that have an export-based model of economic growth, relying on price competitiveness to build market share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is typical of the ‘Asian Tigers’, but may be less relevant for mature European economies where export performance is driven by other factors, such as quality or branding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For peripheral euro area countries, which cannot devalue, the way to improve competitiveness is via domestic wage restraint and structural reforms to boost productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.65,0)">In an environment where domestic debt overhangs are large, the former approach runs the risk of creating a debt-deflation spiral: domestic nominal incomes are driven down, while the nominal debt remains unchanged, thereby increasing the real burden of previously accumulated financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Yet Europe’s sovereign crises have erupted in the context of a worldwide recovery, led by strong growth and a potential for inflationary pressure in the emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.38,0)">Such a situation contrasts with the global disinflationary environment of the Latin American crisis in the early 1980s, and the cyclical slowdown affecting Asia in the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Because of the inflationary pressure in some of their many export markets in the emerging world, euro area countries are more likely to regain price competitiveness now than other crisis-hit countries were in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The third difference between the euro area and the EMEs is that European countries generally have more sophisticated domestic financial markets than was the case during the Asian financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In particular, government debt plays several important roles: sovereign yields are the basis for the pricing of many other instruments; government bonds are widely used as collateral in private repo markets; and public debt is an important asset in the balance sheets of domestic banks and the wealth holdings of the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.3,0)">As a result, euro area countries cannot afford to implement a sovereign default without suffering as a consequence of such a default a major breakdown of their financial, economic and social structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.77,0)">There is no post-war example of a government in an industrialised economy restructuring its debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.03,0)">For a euro area sovereign to seek to restructure its debt would be a huge leap into the unknown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.27,0)">This aspect is frequently omitted by financial analysts in their newsletters or by commentators or academics in their short op-eds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.42,0)">And this is the reason why they do not get the point right when they state that default and restructuring is unavoidable in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The fourth difference is that, given the much greater depth and intensity of financial and economic integration in Europe, the strength of contagion across financial institutions and markets is potentially more significant within the euro area today than was the case in Asia in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That is not to say that there was no contagion in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">But the cross-border exposures within the euro area are an order of magnitude greater than was the case for such intra-regional cross-holdings in Asian EMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.56,0)">This means that the potential for spillovers and a systemic area-wide crisis is much higher and has to be factored into the policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Of course, greater economic integration in Europe has been accompanied by greater institutional cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Although now supplemented by the   Chiang Mai Initiative, the framework for economic policy cooperation in Asia involves less deep and intense collaboration than in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The single monetary policy in the euro area is the acme of Europe’s economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.45,0)">And the situation in the 1990s in Asia was much less developed than now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Several Asian countries   introduced capital controls in the face of the financial crisis, something which cannot be done in Europe given the depth of financial integration and the commitments made to the free movement of capital within the Single Market in the EU Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Policy responses to the crises The much deeper set of economic and institutional linkages within the EU and euro area today compared with those that existed in Asia in the mid-1990s has important implications for the policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">In particular, the lack of a regional framework in Asia placed the responsibility for addressing the financial crisis in the 1990s immediately and squarely on the international financial institutions, notably the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">By contrast, the close cooperation between EU countries has meant that the IMF has played a less prominent role in the recent crisis, even though it makes a significant contribution to the design and implementation of the adjustment programmes implemented in Greece and Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I am sure that the density of the EU framework of integration and cooperation has played a very positive part in tackling the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Via both inter-governmental mechanisms   and supranational initiatives  , the EU and its Member States have created an important source of external financial support for the domestic adjustment programmes introduced by Greece and Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The availability of this support has also bolstered and underwritten consolidation measures implemented at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.35,0)">The financing programmes have imposed strict conditionality on the recipient countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">They insist upon the implementation of essential measures, namely fiscal consolidation, financial sector restructuring and broader structural reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.16,0)">While the EU is an equal partner with the IMF in imposing such conditionality, the EU countries that have provided financial support to countries in distress have insisted on IMF involvement because of the credibility this lends to the conditionality of the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.6,0)">Its involvement in Asia would be much more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Given the depth of economic ties and trust between countries within the euro area, a sense of ‘common destiny’ is felt by all, leading to this exceptional level of support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As a result, creditors, in particular official creditors, are therefore more closely bound into the success of the programme and have a strong incentive to ensure that the programme’s conditions are fulfilled, thereby underpinning its success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Aside from their role in fiscal consolidation, the European authorities have also offered support to the financial systems of the most adversely affected countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This has been done via EU/IMF programmes to support restructuring and recapitalisation of crisis-hit banks; and through ECB measures, notably its framework for ‘enhanced credit support’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">By introducing a variety of operational facilities, the Eurosystem has ensured that liquidity continues to flow to the peripheral countries, preventing a seizing-up of financing flows in those hardest hit and a significant disruption to the European financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Indeed, one of the most important contributions made by the EU framework has been to ensure that the policy responses to the financial crisis have taken a sufficiently Europe-wide – or at least euro area-wide – perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Given that the responsibility for financial supervision and fiscal sovereignty remains at national level in the EU, at the peak of the financial crisis there was a natural tendency for Member States to resort to national solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.76,0)">A number of countries succumbed to this temptation, in the process imposing costly externalities on other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.89,0)">For example, providing government guarantees for all bank liabilities in one jurisdiction prompted outflows of deposits from other jurisdictions, requiring similar guarantees to be offered elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.96,0)">This may have resulted in an overall level of intervention that was unnecessarily intrusive and undesirable in terms of the incentives created in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.97,0)">In short, the existence of considerable externalities and scope for significant spillovers within a financially integrated region like the euro area may have led to individually reasonable actions resulting in a collectively inferior outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Recognising these concerns, the EU institutions have stepped in to ensure that an area-wide perspective, internalising these externalities, is adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">As we have seen, coordinating both public and private behaviour to achieve a favourable outcome in a multiple equilibrium setting requires both clear and credible programmes at national level, and support and coordination at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">After a somewhat hesitant start, the European Union is now moving towards a stronger institutional framework to support this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Looking beyond the horizon of existing programmes, the crucial longer-term macroeconomic and financial discipline requires further institutional change and integration, notably an enhanced Stability and Growth Pact, and the introduction of a new and more effective system of macroeconomic surveillance across EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The creation of the European Systemic Risk Board to conduct macro-prudential surveillance and the three new European Supervisory Agencies for the financial sector also aims to improve the quality and coordination of financial regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Having said that, the main responsibility for dealing with the weaknesses underlying the sovereign debt and associated banking crises remains at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">It is important to recognise that the relevant EU Member States now fully understand and accept this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">In contrast to the experience in Asia in the 1990s or Latin America in the 1980s, there is little attempt to blame the sovereign crisis on foreign investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.63,0)">Responsibility cannot be shifted offshore: the countries most immediately affected know that they have to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">With the support of the EU and IMF, these countries have embarked on ambitious programmes of consolidation and structural reform to correct their domestic financial and economic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.77,0)">As I have already said, the origins of the intertwined financial and sovereign crises lay in institutional and economic frailties in the most afflicted countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It is mainly up to these countries to correct these weaknesses and cure the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">A key element of the resolution of the Asian crisis in the mid- to late-1990s was a deep and fundamental restructuring of the domestic financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.1,0)">This was implemented in what, at that time, was seen as a relatively abrupt manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.88,0)">The conditionality imposed on IMF financial support was associated with the application of ‘shock therapy’ to Asian countries’ financial sectors: losses had to be written down immediately, banks were closed or sharply restructured and many institutions were sold to foreigners, arguably at ‘fire sale’ prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Within the euro area, various buffers – not least, the Eurosystem’s provision of liquidity support – have tempered the stresses in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.26,0)">This reflects the recognition that, within such a deeply economically and financially integrated region, ‘shock therapy’ adjustments may, through spillovers, weaken the financial system in other parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">However, we must also ensure that such liquidity support to the banking sector does not delay or hinder the fundamental reforms required to address the underlying weaknesses the financial crisis has revealed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.18,0)">In the end, the crisis-hit countries have no alternative: they have to make fundamental reforms to their banking systems, involving substantial restructuring and, in some cases, very significant downsizing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Liquidity support can help to reduce adjustment costs by smoothing the transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But those costs should not be used as a pretext for delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Concluding remarks Financial markets are testing the strength and resilience of the euro area and the willingness and ability of the euro area authorities to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro as a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The institutional response to their challenge has been swift, strong and resolute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">As regards monetary policy, the Eurosystem has implemented a set of measures that ensure the provision of liquidity to the euro area financial system, including to the banks of those peripheral countries that are currently subject to the greatest market scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">With respect to fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances, euro area governments are now strengthening the rules for fiscal and broader economic policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">They have created and are refining facilities that can provide external financial support to those Member States facing the most intense pressures in sovereign debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">These developments aim to correct the deficiencies in the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union exposed by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">These facilities need to have sufficient resources as well as the flexibility to contain market pressures and coordinate the public and private sectors so as to achieve a sustainable and mutually beneficial outcome in an environment where several equilibria may be possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The Asian experience in the mid- to late-1990s demonstrates that radical reform can lead to a sustained recovery – one achieved largely without restructuring public debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Indeed, one can argue that Asia has emerged from its financial crisis stronger than before: the institutional weaknesses which contributed to the build-up of financial fragilities, but were masked by high growth rates during the pre-crisis boom have been addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Similarly, Europe will emerge from its current travails stronger if the weaknesses revealed by the recent financial crisis are properly identified and corrected through institutional innovation and reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">I am confident that this will be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.42,0)">But in Europe, the crisis is viewed differently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.34,0)">The problems we face today are the result of a flawed implementation of a fundamentally good idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.96,0)">The bumpy ride of Economic and Monetary Union is largely the fault of the driver, not the vehicle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">He has to learn from his mistakes and get some more practice – then he’ll be a better driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.18,0)">As for the vehicle, it needs better brakes, for even the best of drivers can occasionally make mistakes.</span>
