    <h1> The euro in 2000: principal features of the ECB's monetary policy </h1>
    <h2> Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Recoletos Forum, Madrid, 29 June 2000 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> The euro in 2000: principal features of the ECB's monetary policy Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Recoletos Forum, Madrid, 29 June 2000 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to speak to you here at the Recoletos Forum in Madrid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In order to provide you with the perspective of the European Central Bank   on the performance of the euro as the single currency of the euro area, it will be helpful if I begin with a review of the objective of the single monetary policy and its underlying strategy, as well as the operational framework of the Eurosystem  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">After I have made some comments both on monetary and economic developments which have taken place in the euro area and on the risks to price stability as they have appeared in the first months of 2000, I shall outline the responsibilities of the individual policy areas in achieving and sustaining high growth in an environment of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I shall then discuss the euro's role in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Finally, I shall conclude with a view on the general prospects for the euro area and its single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The monetary policy objective, strategy and operational framework As is well-known, the main objective of the Eurosystem is the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From today's perspective, the maintenance of price stability seems to be the natural objective of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Looking back at the post-war decades, however, reveals that this objective has not always been assigned to central banks, even less achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.77,0)">At the same time, it shows the negative consequences of a monetary policy which is not strictly geared towards price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In particular, the experience of the 1970s and early 1980s clearly confirmed the following three principles: first, that inflation is a clear obstacle to sustained economic growth; second, that central banks cannot afford to pursue several different, potentially contradicting objectives; and, finally, that their independence is essential in order to secure this medium-term objective for the common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">For this reason, the Eurosystem has been assigned the clear objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In order to make this objective more precise and explicit, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided that price stability should be defined as "a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">According to this definition, price stability "is to be maintained over the medium term".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">In order for the Eurosystem to achieve price stability, there is a need for a clear strategy, for adequate and timely monetary decisions and for an efficient operational framework, in order to ensure that these decisions are effectively transmitted to the financial sector and ultimately to the whole economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me first say a few words about the Eurosystem's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is based on two pillars, the first of these being a prominent role for money, and the second a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon; thus, giving money a prominent role in its monetary policy analysis is quite natural for a central bank geared towards price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The important role assigned to money is reflected in the announcement of a reference value of 4 1/2% for the annual growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Current M3 growth is analysed and interpreted in relation to this reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.12,0)">Under normal conditions, substantial or prolonged deviations of monetary growth from the reference value would signal risks to price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">For the euro area, this relationship is empirically well-founded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Available econometric evidence suggests the existence of a stable relationship between M3, the euro area price level and a small number of other area-wide macroeconomic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Moreover, there is solid evidence with regard to the leading indicator properties of M3 for future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.59,0)">While there can be no doubt as to the relevance of monetary growth for inflation in the medium term, short-term changes in the stock of money may be influenced by factors unrelated to future spending and future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.1,0)">Thus, the Eurosystem does not react mechanically to short-term deviations of monetary growth from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Instead, monetary developments are analysed very carefully in order to extract their information content with regard to future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">If this analysis suggests that monetary developments are a threat to future price stability, monetary policy will respond in a manner appropriate to counter this risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In parallel with the monitoring of monetary aggregates, the ECB also pays close attention to various other indicators which may signal inflationary risks or tensions: this is the second pillar of the monetary strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, while inflation is a monetary phenomenon over the long term, it is useful in the short to medium-term to detect those inflationary tensions in the economy - reflected in various real and financial indices - which are not captured by monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">With these two pillars and the various indicators, monetary policy-making in the euro area may appear complex, but this reflects the complexities and uncertainties which surround the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in modern economies, and, even more so, in the new economic environment created by the changeover to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Against this background, the Eurosystem must rely on a whole range of indicators and on a variety of models which help to sharpen and cross-check the analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The efficiency of monetary policy does not rely only on a careful analysis of the monetary, financial and economic situation, but also on the ability to explain monetary policy decisions to the public in a convincing manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In the case of the Eurosystem, this is an even more arduous task than usual, as the single monetary policy must cope with a new environment and be explained to a public from different cultural backgrounds on the basis of new indicators and data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our choice is to base this communication on transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This means that our external presentation of monetary policy must fully reflect the internal analysis and discussions which take place within the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I can personally assure you that this is the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Our internal discussions are organised in such a way as to ensure a full and thorough assessment of the two pillars I have just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Our external communications fully reflect this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In addition to a well-defined and informed strategy, the monetary policy of the Eurosystem must rely on an efficient operational framework, that is, on a set of instruments and procedures necessary for the implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Thus far, this framework has proved successful in clearly signalling the stance of monetary policy, in steering short-term market interest rates and in providing liquidity to the banking system in an efficient manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the heart of the framework are the weekly refinancing operations which were conducted at interest rates broadly in the middle of the interest rate corridor, which is set by the rates on the two standing facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A minimum reserve system ensures the existence of a liquidity deficit in the banking system, which is necessary for the conduct of these weekly open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The credit institutions need only comply with the minimum reserve requirement on average within the reserve period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This contributes to the stabilisation of money market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A key element for the functioning of the operational framework has been the TARGET payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This payment system interlinks the 15 national real-time gross settlement systems and the ECB's payment system, by providing a uniform platform for the processing of cross-border payments in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">It has allowed a single interbank market interest rate across the euro area to prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Overall, the operational framework of the Eurosystem has proved efficient in providing liquidity to the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This does not mean that this framework is rigid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">On the contrary, it must adapt to the situation and evolution of the money market in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this regard, the Eurosystem switched from a fixed to a variable rate tender for its refinancing operations on 8 June 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">Let me make clear that this technical decision does not in any way modify the stance of the Eurosystem's monetary policy, nor does it preclude renewed use of fixed rate tenders in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The sole aim of this changeover is to address the severe overbidding problem which developed in the context of the fixed rate tender procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary and economic developments in the euro area Turning from theory to practice, I shall now consider current monetary and economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">As you know, the Governing Council of the ECB raised the rate of its main refinancing operation, and that of the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility by 0.5 percentage point to 4.25%, 3.25% and 5.25% respectively on 8 June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This decision was based on the conclusion that both pillars of the monetary policy strategy pointed to upward risks to price stability in the euro area in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.48,0)">With regard to monetary developments, M3 growth has deviated from its reference value since the beginning of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This deviation has increased further since the beginning of 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Thus, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from February to April 2000, increased from 5.9% in the preceding three-month period, to 6.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As a consequence, the deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% rose to almost 2 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The assessment of there being ample liquidity in the euro area was further supported by the continuing rapid expansion of lending to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The annual growth rate of lending to the private sector stood at a very high level throughout 1999 and in the first few months of 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Important determinants underlying this development are strong economic activity in the euro area and very favourable industrial and consumer confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.07,0)">It must also be noted that real lending rates, although they have been rising since the spring of last year, are still lower in real terms than those observed at the beginning of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.98,0)">Overall, money and credit developments signalled an upward risk to price stability which had to be counteracted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The new monetary data for May which was released this morning broadly confirmed this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from March to May 2000 remained unchanged at 6.3% and loans to the private sector continued to grow rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me now discuss the outlook for growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This is a rather pleasant task, as the prospects for strong growth are very favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Indeed, let me reiterate our conviction that they have not been this favourable in many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">If central bankers are famous for anything, it would normally be for guarded rather than for exuberant views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">So, for a central banker, this assessment is quite something.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I therefore hasten to fill you in on some of the underlying details.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The consensus view emerging from the forecasts currently available is that of strong economic growth of over 3% in the euro area both this year and next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This is clearly more than most forecasters expected at the end of last year, when projections were still very much made in the light of the previous crises witnessed in emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Since then, there has been a strong upturn in growth in the second half of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Available short-term indicators suggest that growth will also be strong in the first half of this year, in line with current forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The positive outlook for euro area growth incorporated in current forecasts is supported by favourable conditions for growth from both the domestic and the external side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The growth in domestic demand has proved highly robust in the face of the slowdown which followed the Asian crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The fact that confidence indicators are currently at or close to record highs is fuelling expectations that domestic demand growth will also be strong this year and next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Continued strong employment growth and increasing capacity utilisation, among other factors, should underpin the expansion of private consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">On the external side, there are now increasing signs that the upturn in growth in the global economy has been stronger, more rapid and more broadly based than was expected at the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Reflecting this favourable external environment, the growth in euro area exports should remain strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.45,0)">There are, of course, some uncertainties surrounding euro area growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">These come mainly from the external side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.15,0)">They are mostly linked to a possible pronounced slowdown in the US economy and the ensuing negative effects on the growth of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the present context of strong growth, the outlook for inflation should be examined thoroughly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.14,0)">In this regard, the risks to price stability remained persistently, up until our recent decision on interest rates, on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.23,0)">According to the forecasts currently available, consumer price inflation in 2000 and 2001 is generally projected to be slightly below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This is clearly higher than was expected in the respective forecasts at the end of last year and early this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">We should, of course, bear in mind that these forecasts are snapshots of economic prospects as they appear at a particular point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.72,0)">They are typically surrounded by a fair degree of uncertainty and they are highly conditional on a number of specific assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">Oil prices and exchange rates are prominent examples of such forecast assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.08,0)">The movements in these variables in the past few months show how quickly such assumptions can move out of line with actual developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Moreover, in the case of the forecasts currently available, some of these explicitly assume that short-term interest rates will rise over the forecast period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I think that it is fair to say that without this assumption projected inflation would most likely have been higher in the forecasts concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Thus, the inflation outlook for the euro area gave a very clear signal to monetary policy: namely that there was no reason for complacency and that monetary policy had to react.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The developments in oil prices and the exchange rate have led to a strong rise in import prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The   effects of this rise in consumer prices are unlikely to have fully materialised as yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">In the context of the aforementioned prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area, the protracted rise in import price inflation in the past few months clearly gave rise to a greater danger of a spillover to domestic sources of inflation, such as, for instance, firms aiming at raising or restoring profit margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These risks had to be counteracted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">With our monetary policy we are contributing to the conditions for high, sustained, non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Since November of last year, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to raise interest rates by a total of 175 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Admittedly, this is not negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.24,0)">Given the strong economic data, the continuously high level of confidence and the continued strong growth of money and credit, the increase in interest rates does not mean that the ECB has put the brakes on growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Economic expansion in the euro area is now strong enough not to be hurt by a gradual adjustment of the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The interest rate moves are providing a clear signal to market participants, social partners and policy-makers that the ECB is determined to counter inflationary dangers in a timely fashion, and that the prospects for price stability in the euro area remain good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">This is also of great importance for the longer-term potential of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The responsibilities of individual policy areas in ensuring sustained non-inflationary growth This brings me to a crucial issue: the single currency is the joint responsibility of all policy-makers and Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Monetary policy is strictly geared towards the maintenance of price stability and thus also makes an important contribution to strong growth in output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, monetary policy needs the support of other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This is best achieved by having specific roles, clear mandates and agreed responsibilities for the individual policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me go into these in a little more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The best contribution which monetary policy can make to sustainable growth is to achieve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.87,0)">Indeed, inflation entails numerous costs and creates an uncertain economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.87,0)">This is harmful to an optimal allocation of resources and thus hampers economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.9,0)">Some costs of inflation are quite tangible, as is the case with those induced by the periodic revision of prices and indices or the increasing cost and time spent in cash transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">More generally, increased inflation is accompanied by increased volatility of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.88,0)">Stable high inflation has almost never been observed, and is seemingly a contradiction in terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.93,0)">This volatility of inflation creates uncertainty which affects economic and social decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.14,0)">For instance, wage negotiations and settlements are complicated by the necessity of establishing some form of indexing system with frequent revisions; interest rates incorporate a risk premium, which increases the cost of financing; the volume and the direction of long-term saving and of investment are affected by unnecessary uncertainty with regard to the future level of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.95,0)">Finally, as high inflation is never well-predicted, price increases will create undue wealth transfers between economic agents or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This will bias the indicators of economic return and divert time and resources for the purposes of either sheltering, or taking profit, from inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To summarise, price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient functioning of the system of relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">A well-functioning relative price mechanism reflects the demand for, and cost of, goods and services in a market economy and allows an optimal allocation of real and financial resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The contribution made by price stability to sustainable growth also has a social aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.67,0)">In the long run, economic growth is likely to be affected by a situation in which undue and non-transparent wealth transfers occur, which give rise to social discontent and eventually undermine the stability of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.63,0)">For instance, inflation creates a well-established fiscal bias, as tax bands may not be sufficiently updated or because interest incomes are taxed, whereas they incorporate a risk premium which does not constitute an effective income in itself, but rather compensates for the depreciation of financial capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.89,0)">In addition, inflation mostly affects social classes less able to protect themselves against changes in nominal prices, if only because the larger part of their financial assets is held in a current account with no or fixed interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.28,0)">Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, inflation tends to discourage long-term saving, especially that directed towards pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.29,0)">This prevents people from securing their savings for long-term purposes in a reliable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.79,0)">In the long run this could affect the people's sense of belonging to society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.31,0)">As John Stuart Mill once said, money   is one of those instruments whose importance is only felt when put out of order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Over the last century, the European economies and societies have had sufficient experience of this to value the wisdom of this judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.38,0)">Times may, of course, have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.03,0)">You may think that this concern is now a bit old-fashioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I would just say that monitoring and combating inflationary pressures is a permanent task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.04,0)">It is an essential feature of a market economy that it will generate inflationary or, less often, deflationary tensions from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.93,0)">It is not because the river is regulated that the dam is useless!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">What about the other policy areas?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">How can they best contribute to sustaining high non-inflationary growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Taking stock of the broad policy developments currently observed in the euro area might suggest that there is little to worry about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Recent wage settlements have been relatively moderate, public finances have improved, deregulation and liberalisation are under way in a number of sectors, and there are signs that labour markets are gradually becoming less rigid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">However, while it is acknowledged that progress is being made, it is also clear that there is still quite some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Further efforts are required in all these policy areas in order to create the best conditions for the current upswing in economic activity to be turned into a period of sustained strong growth in an environment of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">For fiscal policies the challenge and opportunity is to use the current economic expansion to intensify the necessary further consolidation of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.11,0)">In a number of Member States the budgetary situation is still too far from reaching the targets specified in the Stability and Growth Pact, namely that budgets are to be in surplus or at least close to balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, the recent reduction in deficits has been greatly helped by the relatively low levels of interest rates and by improving economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">According to most forecasts, fiscal trends over this year and the next even point to a pro-cyclical stance rather than to prudent anti-cyclical policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.4,0)">The overriding goal for fiscal policy should be to shelter governments' budgets from normal cyclical fluctuations, but also from unexpected shortfalls in revenues and interest rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In addition, governments' budgetary policies also need to urgently address longer-term issues in the context of the imminent problem of ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.35,0)">Many governments are as yet insufficiently prepared for this problem, inasmuch as they are still highly indebted and are not pursuing the structural reform of public transfer systems with sufficient vigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The assessment that much has been achieved, but that, at the same time, much remains to be done, also holds true in the case of general economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The structural reform of labour and product markets remains the key to achieving significant reductions in unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.1,0)">There is by now broad consensus on the fact that the larger part of the still very high level of unemployment in the euro area is of a structural nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.81,0)">Only flexible labour markets will prevent bottlenecks from emerging and triggering upward pressures on prices at a relatively early stage of the current economic upswing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Looking at the regulatory reform process across the euro area, a good deal of deregulation and liberalisation of previously sheltered sectors have taken place in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">There remains significant scope for further action along these lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In regulated industries, a low level of competition is often accompanied by a high level of public ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Privatisation and regulatory reform should thus be seen as mutually reinforcing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The favourable impact of such measures in terms of lower price increases has become clear in the case of the telecommunications and energy sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This should be encouragement enough to step up efforts in other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Notwithstanding significant demands on labour mobility in the short term, increased competition in previously sheltered sectors will usually result in longer-term employment gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Responsible wage policies are of crucial importance for the maintenance of price stability and the creation of new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Wage growth has been relatively moderate in the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The outcomes of recent wage bargaining in the individual Member States signal that it will also remain moderate throughout the current year, and possibly next year too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">What is required is lasting wage moderation which simultaneously ensures consistency with price stability and allows for net employment gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In times of high unemployment, this means that real wage increases should not fully exploit productivity increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">By accepting these responsibilities, the social partners would be acting in their own interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Monetary policy needs to, and will, be conducted in such a way that the partners in the wage bargaining process can be confident that price stability will be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Overall, the point which I made earlier in respect of monetary policy also holds for other policy areas: there is no reason for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">At the same time, with all the appropriate policies in place, the momentum of sustainable non-inflationary growth could eventually be even stronger than is currently anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This would indeed mean a great step for the euro into the year 2000 and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The euro and the financial markets The creation of the euro has accelerated the development and integration of the capital markets in Europe, which, in recent years, have also been fostered by financial liberalisation and technological innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This also contributes to high growth, as more efficient financial markets help in allocating funds to their best use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In effect, the single currency has removed the exchange risk between the countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is facilitating the standardisation of debt instruments and their management on a larger scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This integrative effect of the euro has been most evident in the money market, by virtue of, in particular, the establishment of TARGET, the large-value payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This integration has shown itself in, for example, the rapid adoption by the market of reference rates for the euro area, such as the EONIA overnight rate or the EURIBOR for maturities of less than one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Above all, we have seen a total convergence in short-term interest rates within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.74,0)">In bond markets, the integration of markets remains incomplete, owing, for instance, to national differences in respect of taxation, accounting and supervisory regulations and payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Nevertheless, the integration of bond markets is progressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">We have seen European bond indices become standardised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.84,0)">The differences in rates between sovereign issues within the euro area fell substantially in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Furthermore, 1999 was characterised by a spectacular growth in euro bonds issued by private non-financial firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These issues increased by almost 300% in 1999, as compared with 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The increase was particularly large for issues with a lower rating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">For example, issues with a Baa-rating increased by 500%, albeit from a very low level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">From a global perspective, the growth in the bond market is contributing to the internationalisation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In 1999, international bond issues denominated in euro amounted to 40% of total worldwide bond issues .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This constitutes an amount comparable with bond issues denominated in US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In the same way, the integration of stock markets is progressing, although they will have to overcome barriers of the same kind as those which I have just mentioned in relation to the bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A notable increase in transactions on the new European indices has been observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, the "new markets", with growth figures benefiting greatly from the establishment of the large European market, have expanded considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Finally, the announcement of stock exchange alliances and mergers over recent months reflects the logic of stock market integration and will accelerate the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">As I have said, the broadening of the capital markets and their greater integration are contributing to a more efficient allocation of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">First, this development is leading to lower transaction costs and is increasing the liquidity of the traded instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This, in turn, will contribute, all other things being equal, to reducing the absolute level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Second, it is multiplying investment opportunities, increasing the range on offer and fuelling competition between issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Meanwhile, the deeper market calls for a restructuring of and rationalisation in the finance industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This should strengthen the management of savings in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">To illustrate this trend, let me recall that the total value of mergers and acquisitions involving banks in the euro area clearly exceeded the already high level recorded in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">In 1999 it was also above the level for similar transactions reported in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion As I said in my introduction, price stability is the principal objective of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is on the basis of this general objective that we assess real and financial developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is also the principal criterion on which monetary policy should be judged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This principle of price stability can be considered a major precondition for sustainable growth in the euro area in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The current environment is favourable: the business cycle in the euro area is oriented upwards, technological innovation is contributing to more efficient production schemes, the creation of the euro is a powerful factor in restructuring European economies and unemployment is falling as a result of, in part, structural reforms implemented by governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">It is up to economic policy-makers in the euro area to pursue liberalisation, flexibility, fiscal consolidation and public efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It is up to consumers and producers to reap all the benefits of this favourable environment.</span>
