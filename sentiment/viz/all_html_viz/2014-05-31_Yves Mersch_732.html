    <h1> Law, money and market: the legal dimension of monetary policy </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Information Club Meeting, Luxembourg, 31 May 2014 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Law, money and market: the legal dimension of monetary policy Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Information Club Meeting, Luxembourg, 31 May 2014 EMBARGOTransmission embargo until 10 a.m. CET on Saturday, 31 May 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.1,0)">What I would like to address in my remarks is what went wrong with the governance of the euro area and how to fix it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But as this has been much discussed in the past, I want to come at the question today from a slightly different perspective: that is, to go back to the first principles of what makes a market economy function, and then to look at the situation in the euro area from there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Law, money and the market A well-functioning free market is a socio-economic construct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is created by a consistent accord of rules, instruments and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As economies develop, what this accord entails changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But at the most fundamental level there must be a harmony of law, money and freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is because the rule of law guarantees the freedom of the individual by defining the scope and boundaries of his or her action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And in turn, it is the freedom of the individual that creates the agency and choice which is essential to produce a free market to the benefit of the whole society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The way money fits into this framework was well illustrated by Nicolas Oresme, who was bishop of Lisieux and adviser to Charles V, the king of France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In 1360 Oresme initiated a sweeping monetary reform after a period in which the currency was debased many times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A comment that is attributed to him at this time is that “Money must be as solid as a law, as stable as a law of nature”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">In essence, what Oresme was saying was that solid law and stable money are two sides of the same coin  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They both support the ends of the individual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The law exists to create an environment in which individuals can make free and safe decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">Money is the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And both are pre-conditions for a market economy to function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Even one of our most famous Luxembourgeois, John the Blind, implicitly appreciated these interactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">By experimenting with various currency reforms he sought to ensure that each coin in his realm would have the same value in trade and commerce, regardless of its geographic origin or disparities in physical appearance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">At the time of course the debate was about the law of God taking precedence over the law of kings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But fittingly, his motto was “Ich dien” – German for “I serve”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And indeed, this notion of money as “public service” was exported and lived on: the same phrase appeared on British two pence coins until 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Thus, there is a long intellectual tradition linking rule of law and sound money to functioning of free markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But this connection found perhaps its clearest expression in the ordoliberal school that developed in Germany in the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Conceived at the University of Freiburg by Walter Eucken and Franz Boehm, the central understanding of ordoliberalism was that a stable and well-functioning market economy required a strong legal and institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.36,0)">Pure laissez-faire capitalism was unstable and liable to capture by monopolies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.33,0)">Collectivist central planning, on the other hand, led towards waste and totalitarianism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Thus, as the ordoliberals saw it, the role of government was to frame markets in such a way that actual outcomes would approximate the theoretical outcome in a perfectly competitive market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.0,0)">Achieving such outcomes could imply de-regulation, if government was interfering too much in market processes, or re-regulation, if market failures were apparent – a feature that distinguished it from a laissez-faire approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.3,0)">In other words, the role of government was both to untie the “invisible hand”, and to keep it firmly cuffed to the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">At the same time, ordoliberalism recognised the crucial importance of monetary and economic stability to a well-functioning market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This implied an economic framework built around price stability, competition regulation and budgetary discipline – in Eucken’s words, the perfect “economic constitution”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This thinking had a strong influence on the design of the post-war social market economy in Germany, and is seen by some as the foundation for German economic success in that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Interestingly, as many developing countries transitioned from planned to market economies in the 1980s and 1990s, there was something of a large-scale social experiment of the ordoliberals’ views outside of Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Several transition economies followed the macroeconomic policy recommendations of the so-called Washington Consensus, which emphasised the laissez-faire side of liberalism – decentralization, deregulation and privatization – while downplaying the legal and institutional underpinnings of a well-functioning market economy..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The “poster boy” for this approach was Chile in the 1980s under the influence Augusto Pinochet and German immigrants connected to his regime, together with the so-called “Chicago Boys.”   While quite striking results were achieved initially, leading Milton Friedman to refer to “the miracle of Chile”, financial speculation and foreign debt quickly built up behind the scenes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, privatisation allowed formerly public monopolies to become private monopolies – precisely what market-oriented reforms were supposed to avoid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.76,0)">The speculation bubble then burst in 1982, after which economic policy changed track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A similar pattern was observable in other transition economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Russia, for example, privatised and liberalised extensively following the collapse of the U.S.S.R.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.63,0)">Without a a solid legal and institutional framework to organise market interactions, however, the country experienced a series of crises, while resources ended up being concentrated in the hands of a few powerful individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These experiences led the assumptions of the Washington Consensus to be progressively revised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.45,0)">Even the IMF acknowledged the flaws in the original list of suggestions, in particular regarding the importance of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Reviewing the available evidence, the economist Dani Rodrik wrote that the strength of institutions is the most important element of development economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The mantra of the so-called “revised” Washington Consensus, he wrote, should be to “get the institutions right.”   The principles of effective economic policy The aim of this brief review is to underscore that all well-functioning market economies are based on a consistent accord of rules, instruments and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And what I would like to turn to now is the state of that accord in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The designers of the euro area clearly intended to build a consistent rules-based framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The euro area fitted within a single market centred on a strong competition authority that could break-up monopolies and remove competitive distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB was established with a mandate to focus solely on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">National fiscal policies were expected to be stability-oriented and conducted within a strict framework, known as the Stability and Growth Pact  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This would be supplemented, it was believed, by the disciplinary force of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.25,0)">This begs the question: why did the euro area then have a major crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.01,0)">The answer, in short, is that the designers got it wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.79,0)">The accord of rules, instruments and institutions in the euro area was in fact inconsistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.12,0)">There were two dimensions to this: The first was inconsistency within policy areas, which produced a fragmented and unstable governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.96,0)">The second was inconsistency between policy areas, which caused negative interactions between them to appear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me address each in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.0,0)">Inconsistency within policy areas In a highly integrated currency area like the euro area, there are several types of economic policies that are “of common concern”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.17,0)">This may be because they have consequences on euro area aggregates – for example, excess domestic demand in one large country pushing up overall euro area inflation – or because they create spillovers for other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">These policies therefore warrant some form of coordination at the euro area level, notably via common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The implementation of these rules, however, can broadly speaking take two forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">One form is where rules are agreed centrally but applied decentrally by national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">For this to work, however, there has to be very little room for discretion in how those rules are applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.34,0)">Otherwise, political and economic preferences at the national level or industry lobbies can lead to substantial divergence between member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.0,0)">This in turn risks externalities for others in the currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">Another form is where rules are agreed centrally and applied centrally by a European institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">In this case there can be discretionary decision-making, as the European institution, provided it has sufficient independence, is not influenced by preferences at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.31,0)">Moreover, through appropriate accountability arrangements it will be de facto forced to take a euro area-wide view and apply that discretion evenly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.68,0)">When EMU was launched, only really monetary policy conformed to one of these forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Monetary policy decision-making was fully centralised in a European institution, the ECB, which had substantial discretion in how it implemented its tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This was made possible by the ECB’s clear mandate referenced in terms of the euro area as a whole, for which it was accountable ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This internal consistency explains why monetary policy is the only part of the EMU framework that has clearly functioned as designed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Fiscal policies were supposed to conform to the other form of governance, where countries would decide on and execute their own budgets, but within the strict constraints of the deficit and debt limits set in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.86,0)">Those limits were supposed to be policed by markets, the Commission and other Member States, but in practice the incentives of the latter to enforce the rules were weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.02,0)">This meant that de facto rules could be applied with discretion, while Member States themselves decided on how to exercise that discretion – in other words, the worst combination of the two forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.23,0)">The result was that fiscal positions diverged significantly, which then created substantial spillovers for other euro area members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.99,0)">But perhaps more fundamentally, internal inconsistency meant that fiscal policy itself became ineffective in several jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.76,0)">A number of governments either did not have the fiscal space to absorb the shock they faced in the early stage of the crisis, or they were unable to maintain the trust of the market when investors finally reacted – and over-reacted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.82,0)">Fiscal policy therefore had to effectively give up its stabilisation function – which is vital with a single monetary policy – and switch to convincing investors of debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">Prudential policies were also supposed to fit the decentralised model, although here the framework was even looser.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">While a general set of rules for European banks was progressively established in successive capital requirements directives, substantial flexibility remained in how those rules was interpreted at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.9,0)">The Lamfalussy process was launched in an effort to iron out these differences, but the process rested entirely on cooperation between national supervisors, with no possibilities for binding mediation or enforcement at the European level – and it was fiercely resisted by countries with financial centres.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.93,0)">The divergence this permitted in the application of regulatory and supervisory standards allowed serious financial imbalances to build-up in some jurisdictions, which then of course created serious blowback for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.61,0)">But similar to fiscal policies, an inconsistent framework also undermined the value of prudential policy itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.45,0)">As, for example, definitions of forbearance and non-performing exposures differed widely across countries, investors simply did not trust in banks’ stated asset values and provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In other words, the confidence effects that prudential policy is supposed to provide disappeared when they were most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.19,0)">For structural policies there were no binding European rules at all, as they were seen as having a primarily national significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.0,0)">Inconsistency between policy areas These governance arrangements were not only internally inconsistent, however; they were inconsistent with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Governance of the euro area can be imagined like a set of interlocking cogs wheels: they do not all need to be of similar size – that is, we do not necessarily need the same degree of centralisation in each area – but they need to all move in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.67,0)">If one cog moves in the other direction, the whole machine grinds to a halt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.75,0)">There were several inconsistencies between policy areas in the euro area that had such a countervailing effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.05,0)">To begin with, the frameworks for economic and financial policies pulled in different directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Increasing financial integration encouraged capital to flow from core to periphery, but this was not accompanied by increasing integration of product and services markets to ensure that this capital was allocated efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.65,0)">In fact, as competitive pressures remained weak, in particular in the non-tradable/services sector, certain industries were able to maintain excessive rents and distort price signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.15,0)">This meant that the low marginal product of capital in these industries was offset by rising profit margins, leading capital to become misallocated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.53,0)">The fiscal and financial frameworks also interacted negatively with one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.96,0)">In particular, policy-makers underestimated the extent to which financial integration depended on the false perception of relatively homogenous sovereign credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">As euro area banks were heavily exposed to own governments’ debt, when perceptions of sovereign creditworthiness diverged, so did confidence in their respective banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.41,0)">The resulting market fragmentation further increased sovereign risk, entrenched domestic banks as the marginal buyer of their sovereigns’ debt, and thus deepened this bank-sovereign nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.53,0)">Finally, the interaction between bank and sovereign risk jarred with the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.6,0)">A fragmented banking system not only impaired monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.1,0)">But more fundamentally, it called into question the singleness of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.45,0)">Money, it has to be remembered, is a liability of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.77,0)">Banknotes represent only a fraction of the money we use daily; the bulk of money is deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Thus, for there to be a truly single money, there has to be full fungibility of deposits across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.2,0)">If confidence in national banking systems diverges, such that a deposit in one jurisdiction is seen to worth less than a deposit in another, then money within the euro area is no longer unquestionably single.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.84,0)">Bringing consistency back To sum up, the problems the euro area has faced derive from the fact that it did not learn its own lesson.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The stability of European countries in the second half of the 20th century was based on providing their national economies with the right accord of rules, institutions and instruments to produce desirable market outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.26,0)">Yet when it came to the euro area economy, these tried and tested principles were somehow overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.57,0)">Several policy areas were governed inconsistently, with little reflection given to how the different cogs wheels would fit together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The main aim of the euro area today is therefore to bring consistency back: that is, to make governance of different policy areas mutually consistent and internally consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me briefly review how this is being addressed in the banking, fiscal and economic domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Banking union Since 2012, the priority has been to restore consistency between the single monetary policy and other policies – that is, to guarantee the singleness of money irrespective of the fiscal health of sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.57,0)">Essentially, this had to involve removing the fault lines between national banking systems that called into question the fungibility of deposits, and that meant bringing those national systems together into a single system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">This is where the banking union comes in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Banking union means three things: it means a single supervisory framework that minimises equally the risk that a euro area bank takes excessive risk and runs into failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It means a single resolution framework, so that if a bank does still fail, it can be resolved in the same way, with limited use of taxpayer money, irrespective of where the bank is located or the fiscal strength of its government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And it means a system of deposit protection that provides depositors with equal confidence that their deposits are safe, regardless of jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In terms of implementing these three elements, the euro area has made considerable progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">And importantly, the governance reforms that have been agreed are much more internally consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They come close to the two ideal forms that I mentioned earlier: in some areas there will be centralisation and discretion; in others decentralisation and no discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">From November this year banking supervision will be centralised in the Single Supervisory Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Bank resolution will also be centralised in the Single Resolution Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The latter is particularly important as the legal framework it will implement – the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   – contains quite some discretionary exemptions, in particular from the new bail-in provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">For deposit guarantee, there is no centralisation yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.78,0)">But under the recently adopted directive national schemes will have to meet the same minimum standards for levels and funding, meaning that there is also little discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Implementation, therefore, will be key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Fiscal union Banking Union will certainly help reduce the impact of sovereign risk on the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.72,0)">But still, there is little that can be done if sovereigns pursue manifestly unsound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.53,0)">Domestic banks remain heavily exposed to their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And any regulatory initiatives to address this issue – e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">large exposure limits or doing away with the risk-free treatment of sovereign debt – can only be introduced very gradually in order to avoid market turmoil, and most likely only in the context of other governance reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Thus, to be consistent, a single banking system and a single currency require a fiscal framework that guarantees budgetary solidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The euro area has done a lot since the start of the crisis to strengthen fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">In particular, Member States have sought to move away from the unstable middle ground of the first SGP by anchoring fiscal rules more firmly in national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.22,0)">The Fiscal Compact – which requires countries to run balanced budgets over the cycle and reduce their debt levels progressively towards 60% of GDP – has to be written into national constitutions or equivalent, and is overseen by national fiscal councils.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This comes closer to the model of having decentralised implementation of rules, but with very little discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But will this be enough?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I see two possible outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The first is a stable equilibrium between centralised banking governance and decentralised fiscal governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">That is, banking union better insulates national budgets from financial shocks, meaning budget deficits are generally milder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">And in this context, the Fiscal Compact provides sufficient medium-term credibility to allow fiscal policy to operate counter-cyclically without threatening market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The second possibility is some form of deeper fiscal union at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.1,0)">Economic union Clearly, the political economy of deeper fiscal integration is difficult, especially given the preferences expressed at the recent European Parliament elections in some reform-resistant countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Thus, we should focus our efforts for now on making the new equilibrium work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">But here again we need consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">If the current fiscal rules are to be credible, we need higher growth, and that means looking deeply at how we coordinate structural policies across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.25,0)">On our current reform-resistant course, I see a distant but distinct probability that growth in the euro area begins a secular downward drift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.89,0)">With inflexible markets, downswings are likely to deeper, as adjustment has to happen slowly through quantities – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.01,0)">unemployment – rather than quickly prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.34,0)">And with low productivity and investment, upswings might be shallower as growth is driven only by cyclical rather than structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.01,0)">Indeed, most estimates find that potential growth in the euro area has diminished during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is why moving ahead with structural reform is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The best way to raise real growth in the euro area is to open up product and services markets and to reallocate resources to the most productive industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.34,0)">When I see that most countries in the euro area periphery have a revealed comparative advantage in services  , and yet these markets are the least integrated in Europe, it strikes me as a missed opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.55,0)">Implementing structural reforms is of course mainly a national responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">But so far we have not done enough at the European level to help gather momentum behind them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.21,0)">Some might argue that the European elections will make this harder still, but I would tend to disagree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.29,0)">First, the reasons for extremism in some countries have more to do with national governments than with Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.74,0)">Second, what is causing some people to turn against the EU, in my view, is not a dislike of European governance per se; it is a lack of delivery on jobs and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">If European policy-makers can find better ways to get the most out the European project, I strongly doubt the voters as a whole would be against
