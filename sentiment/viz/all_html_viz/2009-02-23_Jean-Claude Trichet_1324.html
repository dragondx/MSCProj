    <span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)"> Remarks on the future of European financial regulation and supervision Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the Committee of European Securities Regulators  Paris, 23 February 2009 Good morning ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Eddy Wymeersch for inviting me to deliver a keynote address at this conference on the future of European financial regulation and supervision, with a special focus on securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Let me begin by describing current conditions in the financial sector, and the “lines of defence” that central banks and governments have established in an effort to combat systemic risks and to restore market confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In this context, I would like to highlight the crucial role that market participants need to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Next, I will examine ways of reinforcing the resilience of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is an issue that I hope you will be exploring in depth today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, I will comment on the current debate about the EU’s supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A change in this framework has in my view the potential to bring about a substantial improvement in our handling of the banking sector in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The current situation and the policy response First of all, let me say a few words about the situation we are facing now and the policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.93,0)">The financial system of the euro area, like those of the other industrialised economies around the globe, is under severe strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.05,0)">This is not news to anyone here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.7,0)">But what has become increasingly clear since the intensification of the crisis in mid-September last year is that the strains in the financial sector are spilling over into the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.8,0)">This has set in motion a process of negative feedback between the financial sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.09,0)">The financial system is hampering economic recovery and, at the same time, the recession is putting greater pressure on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.94,0)">This situation is more difficult to combat than if the problems had remained largely confined to the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Net credit flows in the euro area remained positive during most of the financial turbulence, which has already lasted more than a year and a half.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.56,0)">But in recent weeks we have seen the first signs of falling credit flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.36,0)">Certainly, an important part of this fall is demand driven: firms have been postponing investment, reflecting the weakening economic outlook, and also households have cut back on borrowing for the same reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">However, there are indications that falling credit flows reflect also supply-side factors and tight financing conditions associated with a phenomenon of deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is here that we have to closely watch developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.78,0)">If such behaviour became widespread across the banking system, it would undermine the raison d’être of the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But there are more positive some elements as far as the financing of the corporate sector is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">One of them is given by the corporate bond market, where issue volumes have remained significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In January, euro non-financial corporate issuance even reached a record high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Hence, this channel is open, and it is functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Of course, not all firms are benefiting equally from it, the pricing has become tougher and high volumes are likely to be partially compensating for more difficult bank financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">But in an environment where we need to search for factors of reassurance, the considerable issuance volumes in the corporate bond market are noteworthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.18,0)">Overall, however, there is no doubt that the situation in the financial sector and real economy remains very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How are central banks, governments and other authorities responding to these challenges?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">And what more should they consider doing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The acute market conditions of last September prompted central banks to take a number of exceptional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">These measures have been instrumental in organising a first line of defence against “systemic liquidity risk”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">They include increasing the size and frequency of liquidity operations, extending the list of eligible collateral, significantly expanding our balance sheets and implementing unprecedented interest rate cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Compared with the period before the start of the turbulence, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has grown by about €600 billion, an increase of 68%, representing just above 6% of the euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This shows that our “intermediation role” has grown very significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">We are now providing – and this is quite exceptional – unlimited refinancing to the banks of the euro area for maturities ranging from one week to six months in exchange for eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This is a very important contribution to liquidity in the financial sector of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Governments for their part have organised a second line of defence against what I have called “systemic solvency risk”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Key measures have included recapitalisations, guarantees and asset support schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The Eurosystem has issued recommendations on the appropriate framework for both government guarantees and recapitalisation measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The aim is to support the banking sector in a way that avoids creating distortions in the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.39,0)">Moreover, measures should be consistent with our liquidity management operations and they should not impair the implementation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The government measures are broadly in line with these recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">More recently, discussions have focused on asset support schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The aim is to remove the uncertainty surrounding the valuation of certain securitised assets on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In this respect, the European Commission, in cooperation with the ECB, is defining broad guidelines for asset relief measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.94,0)">Overall, the decisions governments took in October have helped to avert a major breakdown in confidence in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Some of the measures are still being implemented or under consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The success of these measures ultimately depends on the financial institutions themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Financial institutions have an important responsibility to use the measures made available to them by the authorities, take them fully into account in their decision-making and continue lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Strengthening the financial system Let me now come to my second set of issues and explore ways to strengthen the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.98,0)">Beyond the short-term need to maintain the effective intermediation function of the financial system, the crisis has highlighted substantial structural weaknesses in many areas of this system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This is where we need to rebuild and strengthen our defences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">This effort should be focused on three goals: it should foster sustainability, it should strengthen resilience and it should be holistic in its reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The first goal is a financial system that is sustainable in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This means correcting some of the incentives that have led to excessive short-termism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.74,0)">It is now clear that the promise of significant returns in the short term was often linked to a misjudgement of underlying risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the level of individual institutions, compensation schemes must be adjusted to avoid encouraging excessive risk-taking on the basis of relatively small amounts of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Instead, the incentive structure should encourage profitability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At the level of the financial system, we need to be more resolute in preventing the build-up of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">We must strengthen financial stability assessments and develop mechanisms for translating them into concrete measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The ECB welcomes the proposals to reinforce macro-prudential oversight internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The envisaged closer cooperation between the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum will be particularly useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The second goal is to improve our resilience to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.62,0)">In the years leading up to the crisis, holding capital reserves or larger amounts of liquid assets, which typically earn lower returns, came to be seen as an inefficient use of shareholders’ money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The underlying perspective can be compared to that in the corporate sector many years ago, when technological innovation led to the widespread introduction of the “just-in-time” model of doing business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.48,0)">This meant that firms held minimal inventory levels throughout the production chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The result was a system that looked very efficient but that was very vulnerable to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.31,0)">Something similar has happened to the financial system in recent years: the pressure to increase immediate shareholder value and short-term returns drove a number of institutions to limit their reserves and buffers to the minimum possible levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And just as in manufacturing, the result has been a system that produced very high returns in the short term, but which proved vulnerable to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.17,0)">Comparing the ex post returns with the considerable costs of the current turmoil, we have to realise that our financial system as a whole, including its non-regulated and non-listed entities, was neither strong nor efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.41,0)">It did not allocate capital properly, and it did not manage risks well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.7,0)">I have sometimes compared financial buffers with air bags in a car: what we have done in recent years is let part of the financial sector remove all the air bags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.13,0)">And now there has been an accident, we can see the scale of the injuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We have to put reserves and buffers back into the system; they are the protection against serious damage in a downturn, and they are an integral part of sound finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.46,0)">Such a large-scale reassessment is a matter for the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the present circumstances I wish to underline that banks should not be requested to hold more capital than is required by the existing capital framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.6,0)">We should not today introduce “pro-cyclical” changes in the regulatory framework at a time when we are already observing a market-driven deleveraging of the first magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The third goal is reforms that are holistic in scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this respect, an important issue, which I’m sure will be addressed by today’s conference, relates to the scope of financial regulation and prudential oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The current crisis is a loud and clear call to extend regulation and oversight to all systemically important institutions – notably hedge funds and credit rating agencies – as well as all systemically important markets – in particular the OTC derivatives market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What is currently under discussion is the precise way in which these elements should be integrated into an overall regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Currently, we are in the process of identifying the regulatory gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is taking place within an international discussion, which the ECB strongly supports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The ultimate aim must be to extend the regulatory net to cover all instruments, institutions and markets that are either systemically important or which play a key role for the functioning of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.03,0)">Hedge funds and credit rating agencies are at the centre of the debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In Europe, the discussions on proposed regulatory initiatives to establish a harmonised framework for credit rating agencies and on assessing possible initiatives for hedge funds are important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The proposed regulatory framework for the registration and oversight of rating agencies – with an important role for the Committee of European Securities Supervisors and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors – goes in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">I also welcome the Commission’s initiative to launch a public consultation on hedge funds, to which the Eurosystem will contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Let me stress that both initiatives, on rating agencies and hedge funds, warrant strong international coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The G20, of which the ECB is a member, is setting the key milestones in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The outcome of this debate should be an international agreement about the key features of the new regulatory paradigm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">I mentioned the OTC derivatives market; this is a prime example of a systemically important market that requires more transparency and a better infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council has already called for a strengthening of the infrastructure for this market in view of its systemic importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">We also support the position of ECOFIN, which in December 2008 endorsed the idea of introducing a European CCP for OTC credit default swap markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">And we see considerable merit in having this infrastructure located within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The EU’s supervisory framework Let me now come to the third and last element of my reflections this morning: the supervisory framework in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Many issues are currently under consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would like to focus on a dimension that is very relevant from a central banking perspective, namely macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision of the financial system by central banks needs to be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">There is an international consensus emerging on this need, in the context of the lessons from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem have the technical capacity to assume a stronger role in macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Indeed, it would be a natural extension of the mandate already assigned to us by the Treaty, namely to contribute to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The tasks of macro-prudential supervision include the monitoring and analysis of financial stability, which the ECB is already undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But this goes beyond monitoring and analysis: macro-prudential supervision includes developing early warning systems for the risks in the financial system; it includes conducting macro stress-testing exercises; and it also includes an advisory role on financial regulation and supervision from a financial stability perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Importantly, effective macro-prudential supervision depends on access to data and its translation into concrete measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Access to relevant data is essential for the assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is why such access must be part and parcel of a well-functioning arrangement for macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Two issues need to be considered here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">First, there is a need for a higher degree of transparency as regards the activities of financial institutions and markets that are relevant from a financial stability perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Supervisors and financial institutions have a role to play in enhancing transparency in their domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">To mention a specific example, we very much welcome the current dialogue between the ECB and CESR on the possibility of creating a standard for reference data on securities and issuers, with the aim of making such data available to policy-makers, regulators and the financial industry through an international public infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Such an infrastructure would enable all interested parties to produce more timely analysis of increasingly complex financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Second, central banks need to have access to the supervisory information that is essential for their financial stability assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Central banks and supervisors will also have to work together to establish an operational agreement for the information flow in both directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">This is not always straightforward in Europe given the multitude of actors involved, but here, too, current developments give us a clear mandate, even an obligation, to improve the information flow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The ECB/Eurosystem stands ready to perform additional macro-prudential supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">With our financial stability analysis, which has been well established over a number of years, we have already laid important foundations for such a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I have mentioned the lines of defence established by central banks and governments, to safeguard, respectively, liquidity and solvency in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The reform of the regulatory and supervisory framework at the EU and international levels must substantially enhance the stability of the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The system must strengthen itself and build up its own defences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">I propose a strengthening of the financial system that focuses on three goals: long-term sustainability, improved resilience and a holistic perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The EU has the opportunity for an important institutional change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It can adapt the supervisory framework to the new financial landscape, reflecting the considerable increase in European financial integration that we have observed in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This must be one of the key lessons for us to draw from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The ECB/Eurosystem stands ready to accept any additional responsibilities that the Member States may wish to assign to us, in accordance with the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">I am sure that today’s conference will provide valuable insights on all these matters.</span>
