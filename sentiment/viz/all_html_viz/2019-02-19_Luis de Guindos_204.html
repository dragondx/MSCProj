    <span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)"> Euro at 20 years: the road ahead Address by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the European Parliamentary Week, Brussels, 19 February 2019 I would first like to thank the European Parliament and the Parliament of Romania for this opportunity to reflect together on the first 20 years of the euro and discuss the road ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.09,0)">The euro’s first two decades saw the outbreak of the great financial crisis, which caused a permanent loss in output in all major economic regions around the globe, and of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, which posed an existential threat to the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Steady advances in convergence and financial integration in the euro area had been made before these crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.81,0)">However, as a result of the incompleteness of Economic and Monetary Union the impact of these shocks reversed some of the progress made towards integration, just when they were most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Thanks to a collective effort by European citizens and their leaders, the existential threat to the euro has been overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Several euro area countries have gone through a substantial adjustment phase, macroeconomic imbalances have been unwound, and price competitiveness has improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.21,0)">We have seen an impressive correction in current account deficits and fiscal deficits have declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Also thanks to the support of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the euro area has been on a broad-based recovery path, which has been reflected in improved labour market conditions and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Monetary Union is now more resilient to shocks thanks to the economic expansion, a reduction in imbalances, as well as the significant institutional reforms that have been adopted in the post-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.11,0)">Nevertheless, there is more work to be done: the journey ahead to complete the Economic and Monetary Union   is challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This forum allows me to discuss the important role played by parliaments on that journey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Parliaments already have a significant role to play in the governance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And I believe that we can further build on their contribution to improve the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Rather than focusing on what we need for a better functioning of EMU, I will stress today why and how parliamentary involvement can enhance the legitimacy of economic decisions at national and European level and make them more consistent with participation in a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Answering EU citizens’ legitimacy concerns Our Union is founded on the value of democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And, following the tradition of liberal democracies, it is based on principles, rules and institutions that protect freedoms, rights and the rule of law to avoid abuse of powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">On the one hand, legitimacy in such a system requires that all European citizens, our demos, have a choice and a voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the other, it is grounded in fundamental rules that form the basis of our social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Nevertheless, ensuring legitimacy is not a one-off activity; it requires an ongoing effort by institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Let me look at the example of the ECB, of which I have the honour to be Vice-President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB’s democratic mandate is laid down in the EU Treaties, which were ratified in all Member States according to their constitutional requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Within this mandate, and to fulfil the euro-area wide objectives assigned to the ECB, the ECB has discretion to use its instruments as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And its independence is protected, precisely to ensure that the legitimacy of its decisions is not undermined by accusations of political interference for short-term electoral gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As a necessary counterpart to that independence, the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament, which represents the people of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is complemented by judicial review of the ECB’s decisions by the Court of Justice of the EU and the audit of the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB by the European Court of Auditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">All these elements allow us to show that we are acting in accordance with our mandate and not arbitrarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We take our accountability to the European Parliament very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Over the years, we have developed a strong and comprehensive accountability framework, which goes beyond the Treaty requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">We can affirm that the European Parliament has been very diligent in its regular and in-depth scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">As one should expect, the intensity of this scrutiny was stepped up during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The role of parliaments in fostering a better functioning EMU The ECB’s experience shows how a well-functioning EMU requires strong institutions, strong rules and strong accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">They are complementary and mutually reinforcing in pursuing input and output legitimacy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">ensuring that institutions function smoothly and perform well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Any discussion on what should be done requires us to look at how we can ensure democratic legitimacy and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is particularly true for decisions on economic and fiscal matters, which are highly political; though enshrined in national democracies, they are subject to common European rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In these matters, both national parliaments and the European Parliament already bear an important responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">National parliaments adopt the national government budget and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">At the same time, the European Parliament, as co-legislator, has a key role in the design of an effective and efficient EU governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It needs to consider the cross-border spillovers from national policies, as well as the impact of European policies at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The European Parliamentary Week can play a very useful role here as it allows us to learn from each other’s experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">In fact, there has been no lack of successful reforms in different policy fields across EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me take a concrete example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In the area of financial services, the completion of the banking union is essential for improving the functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking back at what we have achieved since the crisis, the result is quite impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">European banking supervision, which marked its fifth anniversary last year, has brought a more uniform approach to how banks are supervised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">We have also created a new EU resolution framework, which ensures that banks can fail in an orderly manner and that the cost of bank failures is shifted away from governments and onto the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Thanks to these achievements, the banking union is helping to make European banks safer and sounder and more able to support the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We have made good progress, but we are not done yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">On the one hand, we need to complete the banking union by operationalising the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and advancing political discussions on banking union’s missing third pillar: a European deposit insurance scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">To complete the banking union reform agenda substantial risk reduction has already been achieved and the process is ongoing and should continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">But further progress also depends on having a more harmonised regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This entails, among other things, undertaking a serious effort to harmonise options and national discretions  , some of which lie in the hands of national legislators, limiting opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and ensuring a level playing field at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This can only be achieved through European legislation and common institutions, which bring national competent authorities closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">Conclusions In conclusion, allow me to use a metaphor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">National and European parliaments should be like two runners in a relay race.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">They are both essential in passing on the baton of legitimacy: in other words, they should cooperate as one team to ensure the legitimacy of the greater sharing of sovereignty that underpins EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In running this relay race, we need to discuss the optimal allocation of responsibilities between the national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But for this not to happen through the back door, we need to open it up to public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The yearly European Parliamentary Week offers a perfect forum in which to bring it forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Thank you very much and I look forward to today’s debate.</span>
