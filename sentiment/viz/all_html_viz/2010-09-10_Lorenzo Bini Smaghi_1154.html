    <span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)"> Joint ECB-JIE conference on “What future for financial globalisation”: Sovereign debt and the global economy Dinner speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2010 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to welcome you to this conference on “What future for financial globalisation?” A discussion on this topic could not be more timely as policy-makers and academics are currently making great efforts to make sense of what happened before and during the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Questions are being asked about what lessons can be learned and what adjustments need to be made to economic policy in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">When policy-makers have the opportunity to talk to academic researchers many synergies can be identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">That is why I am pleased that this conference has attracted so many excellent researchers in the fields of international macroeconomics and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">I am especially happy that the conference has been co-organised by the Journal of International Economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">I should like to thank the journal’s Editor, Charles Engel, for helping to organise this two-day event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">At the latest Economic Policy Symposium held in Jackson Hole a couple of weeks ago, in a very stimulating paper, Eric Leeper set out a long list of questions that he felt should be addressed by researchers in order to fill the large knowledge gap in the field of fiscal policy and guide it closer to scientific analysis and away from its current state of alchemy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Tonight I would like to add a couple of issues to that list, which are partly related to the international dimension of fiscal policy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I will try to inspire our academic colleagues to give more thought to some issues which are key to the functioning of the global financial system and about which policy-makers often do not have sufficient understanding to inform their actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.46,0)">The legacy of the financial crisis One feature of the financial crisis that has become apparent only at a relatively late stage has been the dramatic and widespread increase in public debt, especially in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I will focus on this legacy and its implications for both the global financial system and the global economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">First, regarding the global financial system, high levels of public debt in major advanced economies are likely to have a non-negligible impact on financial market conditions over the next few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.81,0)">We have seen in some cases how financial markets react to delayed fiscal consolidation, at times in a rather non-linear fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.48,0)">The uncertainties associated with such reactions make it very difficult for policy-makers to calibrate the appropriate budgetary path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.03,0)">There is a risk of a cliff effect, beyond which market participants tend to loose confidence in the ability of sovereign states to repay their debts and regain it only after a very long and painful adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.46,0)">The contagion effects we observed last spring suggest that this risk should not be underestimated, raising a series of issues that have not yet been considered in full, even in the literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.63,0)">What kind of scenarios could develop if the sovereign debts of several advanced economies are no longer perceived as risk-free assets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">How do financial markets work in the absence of a risk-free rate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Second, the asymmetric distribution of public debt across the world economy has important implications for the adjustment of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.14,0)">On the one hand, there is the risk that the protracted and excessive public and external indebtedness of advanced economies could ultimately prove to be – once again - unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On the other, if debtor countries adjust internal imbalances and lift national savings, who will assume the role of consumer of last resort once played by the United States?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.74,0)">This is an oft-posed question in international policy debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Let me address these two issues in reverse order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.18,0)">Global fiscal and current account imbalances The negative correlation recorded during the crisis between the current account and the fiscal balances has been largely in line with expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In the long run, however, current account deficits could well increase again globally if the fiscal expansion which has taken place in recent years is not reined in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.8,0)">In fact, the available evidence suggests that the adjustment of current account imbalances has so far been largely cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The reduction in trade imbalances following the crisis has slowed and, in several cases, has started to reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In both the United States and China we are already close to pre-Lehman levels in absolute terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.69,0)">The sheer asymmetry in size and composition of the fiscal stimulus in advanced countries compared with any measures taken in emerging economies is likely to magnify the expected resurgence of current account imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Similarly to the pre-crisis situation, advanced economies’ indebtedness would be financed with capital flows from emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.16,0)">This implies not only a massive misallocation of global capital, but also undermines the credibility of any initiative to rebalance savings and investments both within and across the main regions of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.67,0)">As a result, it risks creating - once again I should say - delusional expectations in financial markets about the sustainability of imbalanced financial and trade flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Policy discussions are likely to return to where they were a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The crisis has given us the opportunity to question their analytical and practical basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.53,0)">There are concerns regarding the burden of adjustment on deficit countries and its impact on the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">If debtor countries adjust internal imbalances and raise national savings – thus avoiding the scenario of resurging global imbalances – which country would then act globally as the consumer of last resort?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.93,0)">In other words, can we avoid a scenario in which there is protracted slow growth across all regions of the global economy until imbalances are eliminated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Admittedly, this is not a new question, but it is more pertinent than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The typical answer is that, in order to avoid the slowdown, surplus and, in particular, creditor economies should rebalance growth within their economies by increasing domestic demand, strengthening non-tradable sectors and reducing reliance on export industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Thus the policy recommendation to surplus countries is to stimulate domestic demand, in particular through fiscal policies or structural reforms aimed at reducing the level of net savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.12,0)">The problem is that surplus countries are in surplus in the first place either because they are fiscally more conservative, at least compared with the more profligate countries – and rightly so I should add – or are facing a situation in which private savings are very high and might even increase if public dis-savings were to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.39,0)">Since surplus countries are reluctant to embark on expansionary domestic demand policies, the correction of payments imbalances is faced with some form of asymmetry, a situation that is often disliked by deficit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.08,0)">At the global level it has at times been used by the latter as an excuse for delaying adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.7,0)">Global imbalances are the result of a lack of policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It seems to me that we need better economic analysis in order to address this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, we need to understand whether a given level of world growth, if achieved through unsustainable imbalances, is in itself sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In 2003-07 the world economy grew at an unprecedented pace, also owing to the large imbalances financed through the recycling of large capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.94,0)">If these imbalances were not sustainable, the underlying rate of growth of the world economy, and of some of its components - in particular the deficit countries -was probably in itself not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.78,0)">Accordingly, asking who will provide the demand of last resort if the deficit countries save more might not be the right question to ask, because it is based on the presumption that the unsustainable pre-crisis growth rate represents the post-crisis objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We certainly need a better understanding about the potential growth of the various economies and its structure, taking due account of how comparative advantages have changed, also as a result of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.06,0)">My intuition is that such an analysis would suggest that potential growth in the United States is substantially lower than the average growth it experienced over the past decade and requires a shift of resources from the non-tradable to the tradable sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.81,0)">Given that such a shift in resources cannot occur instantaneously, it should not be surprising if the US economy experienced a period of temporary higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.14,0)">In that case, trying to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment to achieve the pre-crisis equilibrium through macroeconomic policies, as some are suggesting, might only delay the adjustment and lead again to an unbalanced path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">On the other hand, some surplus countries, such as Germany, might be able to achieve higher growth than in the past decade, because of the increased potential resulting from their better positioning in international trade specialisation achieved over the years and if they are able to employ resources more efficiently in the non-tradable sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second issue that I would like to raise relates to the endogenous factors that induce rebalancing of growth between deficit and surplus countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.0,0)">Theory suggests that if external demand falls, owing to the lower levels of growth in deficit countries, surplus countries will be able to export less and thus also experience lower growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This would free up resources in the latter countries which should then be allocated to the non-tradable sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.89,0)">Furthermore, the interest rate in surplus countries should fall, inducing residents to save less and consume more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">However, these adjustment mechanisms may take time and may lead to temporary sub-optimal growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.2,0)">It is necessary to investigate whether the adjustment process is indeed slow, especially after a crisis such as the one we have experienced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.4,0)">For instance, some recent figures for the euro area, and Germany in particular, as well as China seem to show that over time the contribution of the external sector may be decreasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The ability of global trade to sustain growth and contribute to global recovery also seems to have been stronger than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">The implications for global finance Let me now turn to the second issue, namely the implications of rising public indebtedness in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.26,0)">Although deficits are expected to start narrowing gradually next year, the fiscal burden remains huge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Government debt levels among advanced economies are expected to increase further and approach 100% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The International Monetary Fund estimates that by 2015 the general government gross debt will reach 110% of GDP in the United States and 95% of GDP in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This amounts to an almost doubling in the United States and an increase of around 40% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Looking forward, the issue of the sustainability of the debt in several industrial countries is looming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.5,0)">This raises several analytical problems, which in my view have not been fully examined in the literature, but which are very important for policy-makers and financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Here I will consider two of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The first analytical problem relates to the assessment of a country’s solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">This task is not as simple as assessing the solvency of a company, a household or a financial institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It ultimately depends on the country’s ability to raise taxes and sustain a level of primary surplus that enables the debt to be stabilised and reduced over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.08,0)">This depends both on economic and political factors that are not easy to summarise in the nice differential equations that economists like to work with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.29,0)">It is thus inevitable that simplifying assumptions are made, but it is often forgotten that excess simplicity may lead to partial or even wrong results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me briefly elaborate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The analysis of the sustainability of sovereign debt has largely been based on the experience of developing or emerging market countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It is now applied to advanced economies, starting with Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">How often do we hear that Europe should learn from the Brady bond experience to address the Greek debt problem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We should, however, examine the risks associated with reasoning by analogy in this way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The risk is that solutions devised for a particular case are not applicable to other cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me give you some examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.81,0)">First, in many debt crises of the past in emerging market economies, the fiscal problem was not necessarily the main cause of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.61,0)">More usually, the crisis originated in the combination of an unsustainable exchange rate peg and foreign denominated debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.32,0)">The devaluation of the currency would raise the stock of the debt in relation to GDP, which in turn would further contribute to make the peg more difficult to sustain and thus fuel speculative attacks against the currency, in a vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.34,0)">Under these circumstances, if a peg could not be sustained, the devaluation would have to be accompanied by a restructuring of the debt or a partial default to stabilise the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is not the case in most advanced economies, either because the debt is generally denominated in domestic currency or because the peg is a “super-hard” one, as in Greece’s case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.11,0)">Certainly, if Greece were to exit the euro – a hypothesis that I make just for the sake of reasoning, but which I consider absurd – its debt burden would de facto worsen given that it is denominated in euro, and partial default or restructuring would in that case be unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">However, thanks to the irrevocable nature of participation in the euro, the debt trap is avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What many analysts – or I should say doomsayers – have not understood is that the debt problem is the biggest incentive for Greece to remain in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.38,0)">Second, in many previous crises in emerging market economies, the debt issued by the country was largely held by foreigners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A restructuring of the debt thus mainly hit foreign citizens and was thus, from a political and economic viewpoint, relatively less costly for domestic residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In advanced economies, the difference lies in the fact that domestic wealth is more relevant in relation to GDP and is partly composed of domestic debt instruments, including government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.85,0)">A debt restructuring or default thus has an immediate and direct impact on the value of the residents’ wealth and thus on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.3,0)">The larger the impact of a   default on the financial and real economy of the country, the more costly a   default would be, compared with the alternative of achieving the primary surplus necessary to stabilise and reduce the public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.21,0)">What is often forgotten is that the wealth effect does not depend only on the direct effects of a default or restructuring of the public debt, but also on the chain of events that would be triggered throughout the entire banking and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.48,0)">Owing to the role of advanced economies as lenders of last resort to their own financial system, as has been confirmed by this crisis, a debt problem at the level of the state would cripple the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.37,0)">This is often ignored by those who claim that there can be such a thing as an “orderly” debt restructuring mechanism for the public debt of advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We need better analysis also in this domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second issue which deserves more analytical work relates to the functioning of global financial markets in allocating resources and setting relative prices in an environment in which the probability of sovereign default becomes significant and widespread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.32,0)">In other words, what happens when certain assets that are considered relatively safe, and in some cases are used as safe havens, are not considered as being that safe any more?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The crisis has shown the importance of financial markets relying on liquid and safe assets to protect against systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Traditionally, the government bonds of advanced economies have played this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.25,0)">What scenarios open up if advanced economies’ sovereign debt assets are no longer perceived as risk-free assets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.98,0)">How would this affect the functioning of financial markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">There is no doubt that there would be some direct spillover to all other assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The riskiness of the global portfolio can be expected to rise more than proportionately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Indeed, if the public sector is itself over-leveraged, who can back up the public sector?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">It can be expected that higher yields and lower asset prices would exert downward pressure on economic activity through increases in the costs of external finance, negative wealth effects and negative effects on confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.2,0)">A world without default-free assets would have further implications for economic activity because these are the prototype of “information-insensitive” instruments, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.82,0)">they serve as “money” and provide the basic functions of money when the opportunity cost of holding money becomes too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.06,0)">For instance, information-insensitive assets are an important source of collateral in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.58,0)">The disappearance of “good” collateral would reduce credit supply and thus impair economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.45,0)">Higher solvency risk also increases other risks at the macro level, such as the risk of “financial repression”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.8,0)">As public debt rises to unsustainable levels, domestic financial institutions may be “encouraged”, if not forced, to hold domestic sovereign debt in their portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">This would lead to inefficient allocation of capital, high costs of financial intermediation and thus lower growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">Finally, in the case of reserve currencies, higher solvency risk would potentially hamper the stability of the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">These questions are just a few examples of the issues on which we need further work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.15,0)">To conclude, it is clear that current and increasing levels of public debt in advanced economies raise problems which are not only of a macroeconomic nature, but affect many other dimensions of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.84,0)">On the other hand, our ability to understand the complexity of the issue is still limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.73,0)">This situation is worrying, to the extent that our societies may take decisions on the basis of imperfect models and wrong assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.35,0)">Not everybody agrees with the concerns I have just raised, and many take the current very low yields on some government bonds as a comforting sign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.34,0)">My impression is that they may be confusing relative and absolute concepts of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.84,0)">And such a mistake could entail very high costs for our societies.</span>
