    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> European banking supervision – achievements, challenges and the way forward Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the ESE Conference 2017, Vienna, 28 September 2017 “What does it mean to be human?” This question has preoccupied philosophers for hundreds of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One of the more popular answers is that humans are rational animals – a view that goes back to Aristotle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let us take that question and adapt it to our world: what does it mean to be a European banking supervisor?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">The answer is certainly not that banking supervisors are rational bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But apart from that, being a European banking supervisor means many things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First of all, it means looking across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It means being tough and fair, unbiased by national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For us, it means being part of a team of supervisors from 19 countries and 27 institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It means working in the public interest – and having an exciting job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But it also means dealing with many challenges at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And it is these challenges I’d like to talk about in my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But as there are many and as our time is limited, I have to make a choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">So let me first tell you what I won’t do today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I won’t discuss the bringing together of cultures and languages that are very different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.73,0)">I won’t discuss dealing with banks that struggle to remain profitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">I won’t discuss digitalisation, and I won’t discuss Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Instead, I will focus on three issues: first, the rulebook for banks and how it relates to supervision; second, the toolbox that supervisors have at their disposal; and third, the role of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Supervisors and the rulebook A solid rulebook is a cornerstone of a stable banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">It ensures that banks acknowledge the risks they take and build up adequate buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A solid rulebook lays the foundations for banking supervisors to do their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Since the financial crisis, the rulebook for banks has been thoroughly revised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.84,0)">Today, banks face much tougher rules than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">They need to hold higher capital buffers that consist of better capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">At the same time, they need to hold liquidity buffers – for the first time ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">And these are just two of the things that help to make banks more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">So the regulatory base has been made more solid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But it needs to be more than solid; it also needs to be level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The rules for banks should, in general, be harmonised across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Only then would banks be able to compete on a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But what’s the scope for harmonisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Here, we should be bold, in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The financial sector is global in scope, and so should be the rules that govern it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And after the crisis, it was precisely this idea that drove the work on a global rulebook: Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">But since then, the political landscape has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.25,0)">It seems that there are some who have stopped subscribing to the idea of a global approach to regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.82,0)">National interests might get the upper hand, and that’s not good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Against that backdrop, we need to finalise Basel III as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But having a global set of standards is just the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The second step is for all countries to implement it in a consistent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That includes the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Here, a level playing field is even more important, given that we have a single currency and a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And there is indeed a single European rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However, when you take a closer look, it turns out that the single rulebook is not so single, after all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">So, in fact, we still have a kind of regulatory hotchpotch in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.33,0)">How can that be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Well, one reason is that parts of the single rulebook come in the form of EU Directives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">And these directives still have to be transposed into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">That in turn opens the door for significant differences between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">One of the many examples relates to what is known as “fit and proper” requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.41,0)">Bank directors have to fulfil certain criteria of competence and probity before they can take up their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, these criteria differ across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.61,0)">In some countries, they are quite strict, in others less so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.15,0)">And as the ECB is bound by national law, we cannot provide harmonised supervision in this case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But the patchwork consists of more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.05,0)">The rulebook also contains what are known as options and discretions, O&Ds for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">These O&Ds provide governments and supervisors with some leeway in applying the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.87,0)">Again, this has led to differences across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Here we have made some progress, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Together with the national supervisors, we have agreed to exercise a number of options and discretions in a harmonised manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.51,0)">But there are still O&Ds that lie in the hands of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So it is up to them to bring about more harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.76,0)">And I admit that I am quite disappointed that so little has been done in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And last but not least, there is a third item that helps to explain Europe’s regulatory mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.85,0)">We still see that some countries are issuing national laws that affect the core of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are, for instance, national laws that govern risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.14,0)">And these laws apply to banks that are directly supervised by the ECB, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Now imagine that there is a banking group with entities in Germany and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.4,0)">This banking group would be subject to different rules when it comes to managing credit risk or to liquidity reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.77,0)">Needless to say, this seems ill-suited to a banking union and a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.43,0)">Now what does this regulatory hotchpotch mean for European banking supervisors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.08,0)">Well, it makes them less effective and less efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.09,0)">In the worst case, they have to deal with 19 national rules instead of a single European one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.15,0)">This makes it hard to treat banks equally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.74,0)">It leads to more bureaucracy and higher costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">It opens the door to regulatory arbitrage, and it distorts competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">My advice is therefore clear: we must further harmonise the rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Instead of EU Directives, we should rely more on EU Regulations, which can be directly applied in all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.18,0)">We should deal with the remaining O&Ds, and we should stop passing more and more national laws, especially those which apply to banks that are supervised at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.01,0)">Instead, we should strive to cut down on some of these national laws, such as those concerning the reporting requirements that have become redundant as a result of the European Reporting Framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Scrapping such laws would increase efficiency and reduce costs for both banks and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">So supervisors need a strong and level regulatory base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, we must be careful that it does not turn into a cage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.57,0)">How could that happen?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.07,0)">How could the rulebook evolve in a way that would confine supervisors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.1,0)">The problem here is “too much detail”, a kind of regulatory “overload” – involving too many stakeholders and too much bureaucracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.49,0)">There is a tendency to add more and more details to the rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is driven by a desire to have rules that cover every eventuality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.54,0)">Whatever happens, there should be a rule to deal with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.92,0)">It would trigger supervisory action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.73,0)">And if it didn’t exist, well, then there’s no trigger and no action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, trying to have a rule for every eventuality is an elusive goal, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">The business of banking is so complex and fast-changing that no rulebook would be able to fully cover it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.15,0)">The unexpected will always happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.09,0)">If not by chance, then because banks make it happen on purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.08,0)">And precisely that is one of the problems entailed by an overly detailed rulebook: regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The more detailed the rules, the more ways banks can game them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.07,0)">This creates new risks, which are then not covered by the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.69,0)">On top of that, an overly detailed rulebook would make it much more difficult for supervisors to react decisively and quickly to a changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.62,0)">Supervising a bank could turn into a mere box-ticking exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.11,0)">And supervisors would turn into experts for tiny details; they could end up focusing on the minutiae and forgetting the big picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.26,0)">And that would be a waste.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.42,0)">It would be a waste of all the experience, expertise and insights that supervisors have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Why not strengthen their judgement?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Why not keep the flexibility they need to react to newly emerging risks in an ever-changing banking sector?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And do all that within a sensible legal framework, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">At the end of the day, we need both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">We need clear-cut rules, and we need sound supervisory judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.23,0)">Adding more and more details to the rules might come at the expense of supervisory judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">With the recent reforms we have struck a balance in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.26,0)">If we were to upset this balance, it would become much harder to ensure that banks remain safe and sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Supervisors and their toolbox But European banking supervisors need more than an adequate rulebook to do their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">They also need the right tools, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">They need a European toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And here, a lot has been done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We have harmonised the main tool of banking supervision: the supervisory review and evaluation process, SREP for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the SREP we take a very close look at each bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">We analyse its business model, its governance, its risk management as well as risks to its capital and liquidity positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The SREP provides a common yardstick to compare banks across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It helps us to identify best practices and spot common problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By referring to the SREP, we develop specific supervisory requirements and measures for each bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And by the way, supervisory judgement plays a big role in the SREP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">But the SREP is a massive tool, and we still need to refine it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me give you an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As part of the SREP, we review the processes that banks use to assess and maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">These processes are known as ICAAP and ILAAP .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Based on what we learnt from our SREP exercises, we will refine our expectations regarding ICAAP and ILAAP, and our methods for reviewing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And we also need to consider how best to assess the risk management of banks in the SREP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We need to do more than just define what we expect with regard to the management of IT risks, outsourcing or leveraged finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We need to define fully fledged minimum expectations for the risk management of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But our toolbox comprises more than the SREP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">So there are other things that we need to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, there are tools that are applied in different ways in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.24,0)">On-site inspections at banks are one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.27,0)">In some countries, the preparation takes some time, while the actual inspection is quite short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In other countries, it is the other way round.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.75,0)">This makes it difficult to coordinate and to create international teams of on-site inspectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, there are tools which exist in some countries but not in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In this regard, the moratorium tool comes first to mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.67,0)">It allows supervisors to suspend all the activities of a failing bank for a short period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It helps to handle such failures in a timely and orderly manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Therefore, moratorium powers should be part of the European toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Another tool that we need to have is called “deductions from own funds”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">It would help to ensure that banks make adequate provision for risks – adequate from a prudential point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The national accounting frameworks allow for some flexibility with regard to provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.96,0)">And what a bank then chooses may not be sufficient from the supervisors’ viewpoint, taking into account the bank’s risk profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">That’s why supervisors should be able to impose prudential deductions from own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">And third, there are some tools which are part of the European toolbox not once but twice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.38,0)">And this can cause problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.98,0)">A relevant case relates to banks that get into trouble and the question of how to intervene as early as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">As a rule of thumb, banks don’t get into trouble out of the blue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.17,0)">Rather, it is a gradual downfall in most cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Thus, we have tools at our disposal that allow us to step in early and send warning signals to the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">This is known as early intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, the relevant tools are the same as some of our standard tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.55,0)">And this overlap might prevent us from using early intervention tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The reason is that we are bound to use the least intrusive tool, which is always the standard one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is particularly relevant should the market authorities demand that the bank disclose whether early intervention tools have been deployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So, the overlap between early intervention tools and standard tools should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">To sum up, we still need to work on the toolbox of European banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We have to expand, harmonise and streamline it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Supervisors and the market Now let us come back to my initial question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Being a European banking supervisor means doing an important job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Equipped with an adequate rulebook and the necessary tools, supervisors help to make banks safe and sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Such banks in turn form the foundations of a strong economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.22,0)">But we should not become too self-centred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Banks are private enterprises, and the banking sector is a market, after all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">As such, it deploys forces that can help to keep risks in check and secure stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">There were even times when many believed that market forces alone could bring about a stable and efficient banking sector, ensure sustainable business models and make banks resilient to the ups and downs of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.14,0)">That belief was shattered by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.82,0)">But don’t get me wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I believe in the market; in theory, the forces of the market work fine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.93,0)">The problem is just that, in practice, they do not always work so well, for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">First of all, the market is made by people interacting, and people have their limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.28,0)">Ample research shows that human brains are not very good at handling risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.89,0)">We tend to over- or underestimate it; we tend to get carried away by potential gains; and we tend to overreact when things change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.39,0)">And then, people’s behaviour depends on incentives which are sometimes distorted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.87,0)">The most prominent example is this: whenever you can keep the gains but pass potential losses on to someone else, you might be tempted to take on too much risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.24,0)">So, in practice, the market has its shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.8,0)">But is that a reason to do away with it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.42,0)">No, not at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We should try to make it work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For the banking sector, this means aligning incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And as I just mentioned, the best incentive to keep risks in check is potential failure and financial loss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.37,0)">As the economist Allan Meltzer noted: “Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.09,0)">It doesn’t work.” But in banking, there was a lack of failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.7,0)">During the crisis, many banks that should have failed did not fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.11,0)">Instead, governments propped them up with public funds – at huge cost to taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.51,0)">They did so out of fear of a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.58,0)">They were worried that when a large bank fails, it would drag others down and destroy the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.22,0)">So there was a situation where banks could pass on any losses to someone else while keeping any profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.19,0)">They had an incentive to gamble with other people’s money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">So, we need to make it possible for banks to fail without causing the whole system to collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And we need to make sure that profit-makers are also loss-takers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">That would align incentives, strengthen market discipline and keep risk-taking in check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In Europe, we now have a new system for exactly that purpose: the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The SRM provides the tools to resolve banks in an orderly manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Earlier this year, it passed its first test when a couple of banks failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This was a huge step towards imposing market discipline on banks and making them safer and sounder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And I can confirm that dealing with a failed bank is among the most complex things you can do as a supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.32,0)">The first step is that the ECB declares the bank failing or likely to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.9,0)">And that, in itself, is a delicate matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.45,0)">A bank can fail for a million reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.38,0)">Sometimes it is a slow death that drags on over weeks and weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.4,0)">Sometimes it all happens within a couple of days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the end, it is up to the ECB to decide whether the moment has come, and that is a decision which cannot be taken lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.5,0)">Taking it too early might infringe the rights of investors and creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.49,0)">Taking it too late might lead to a systemic crisis; it might harm the economy and society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So all in all it is a decision that requires supervisors to carefully judge the case at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.44,0)">Once the ECB has declared a bank failing or likely to fail, another body takes over: the Single Resolution Board, SRB for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">It is the SRB that decides how to deal with the bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.26,0)">In a nutshell, this is how we handle failing banks in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.3,0)">Once you start looking at the details, it becomes much more complex, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It requires all parties involved to closely cooperate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And it requires all parties, including the banks, to be well prepared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">That’s why it is so important for banks to carefully draft their recovery and resolution plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">But as I said, recent experience has shown that our approach works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB, the SRB, the European Commission and the relevant national authorities proved that they can cooperate closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">They have demonstrated that they can deal with failing banks and handle the whole process smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">That said, things can and should be improved, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.69,0)">And I am not just thinking of the actual failure of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I am also thinking of what can be done before it comes to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And here, we need to think about precautionary recapitalisation, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">Under very strict conditions, the European rules on state aid allow banks to be given public funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">However, these aid rules might need an update that would align them with the new European resolution regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In this context, we also need to reflect again on how we define solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">After all, banks need to be solvent in order to receive precautionary recapitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Here, we need to reach a common understanding of how to define solvency, in particular its forward-looking aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As for the banks, they need to reflect on how to handle their liquidity during a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Most importantly, they need to make sure that they have a backstop in place that is readily accessible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And then, when push comes to shove, we need to improve the tools that are needed to actually resolve a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I already mentioned that some tools still need to be added to the European toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.26,0)">The moratorium is one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And finally, we must keep in mind that only systemically relevant banks will be resolved at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">All other banks will be subject to national insolvency regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">It might thus be warranted to harmonise these regimes across Europe to ensure a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All the things I just mentioned will have an impact on how supervisors assess and react to the risks of banks and the risks of bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, What does it mean to be a European banking supervisor?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.32,0)">That was one of my questions at the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And the answer was that it means many things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is a job that is challenging and rewarding at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Today I have mostly talked about the challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">I have talked about the need to write a solid and harmonised rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">I have talked about the need to expand, harmonise and streamline the supervisory toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">And I have talked about how to make the market work again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">To end on a more positive note, let us turn to the rewarding aspects of being a European banking supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Above all, it means being part of a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">It means working towards a stable and truly European banking sector – a banking sector that spans 19 countries and serves more than 300 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.98,0)">And all these people rely on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They rely on banks to invest their savings, to help them start a business or buy a home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It is the job of a European banking supervisor to contribute to a stable banking system that can reliably and efficiently serve these needs.</span>
