    <h2> Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Keynote speech at the 19th Frankfurt European Banking Congress: “After the Crisis”, Frankfurt am Main, Alte Oper, 20 November 2009 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Today’s financial institutions and tomorrow’s monetary order Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Keynote speech at the 19th Frankfurt European Banking Congress: “After the Crisis”, Frankfurt am Main, Alte Oper, 20 November 2009 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is always a pleasure to join you at the annual Frankfurt European Banking Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I noted that the organisers have chosen as title: “After the crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">I understand that the mood in the financial system is one of relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.07,0)">But as of today, it is too early to declare the crisis over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Recent financial developments have been more benign, it is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">However a significant volume of official support underlies these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.74,0)">Nobody knows this better than financial institutions and markets themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The total amount of outstanding ECB refinancing is around 60% larger than it was before the financial market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This reflects also the need for the ECB to “intermediate” parts of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Euro area governments for their part have committed 26% of GDP to supporting the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This assistance has come in the form of guarantees, capital injections and asset support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The magnitude of support is without precedent, and all participants in financial markets should be conscious of that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It has been extended on behalf of the general public, and for the benefit of the overall economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Banks are an important part of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The support has been given for their role in the economy, not for the banks by themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We also have to understand the concern of our democracies as regards compensation and bonuses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Principles have been agreed upon at the level of the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">They were worked out by the Financial Stability Board and approved by the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us apply rigorously those principles, under the control of the banking supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.19,0)">The wrong incentives to embark in absurd risks and dangerous short-term ventures have to be eliminated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.2,0)">Challenges to guard against excesses are as old as mankind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I quote Frankfurt’s most famous son: „ Die Hauptsache ist, daß man lerne, sich selbst zu beherrschen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">Wollte ich mich ungehindert gehen lassen, so läge es wohl in mir, mich selbst und meine Umgebung zugrunde zu richten.“ One could translate this as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">“The most important issue is to learn self-restraint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.11,0)">If I wanted to lavishly let myself go, I could well destroy myself and my environment.” Goethe made this remark in 1830.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.35,0)">I am sure he would have repeated it today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">* * * Three points appear essential regarding the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">First, banks need to strengthen their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">They need to become self-reliant and be able to stand on their own two feet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The authorities can – and have – provided considerable temporary support, but in a market economy we cannot manage the financial sector or provide exceptional support indefinitely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Banks must rebuild their capital base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There are many ways to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The improved capital markets offer opportunities to raise funds including equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Profits earned should be used – as priority – to build capital and reserves, rather than to be paid out as dividends or undue compensation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, banks should lend, because the magnitude of public support has been provided for this purpose, and the strengthened balance sheets will allow them to lend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Banks should strive to maintain their supply of loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.48,0)">Most recently, in the third quarter of this year, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to decline, while the annual growth of loans to households remained broadly unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This pattern of loan dynamics is broadly in line with past regularities around business cycle turning points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.61,0)">But the latest ECB bank lending survey suggests that, while the peak in the tightening of banks' credit standards is behind us, credit standards remain considerably tighter than prior to the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It will be particularly important that banks intensify their efforts to expand their supply of loans once loan demand picks up in the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.56,0)">Third, compensation and bonuses must remain contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">Otherwise, we would take risks that Goethe already described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">When necessary, banks should take advantage of the available government support to achieve these goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">From this perspective, I will interpret the conference theme – “After the crisis” – as an appeal to look forward and draw lessons for the future from our experience of the past two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">* * * I would like to outline now what measures we, as the central bank of the world’s second-largest economy, have taken in the crisis, and how and why we have designed these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">To illustrate, I would like to draw on a medical analogy, identifying three lessons for how we should collectively care for the health of the financial system going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.19,0)">First, once a patient falls seriously ill, emergency medication is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.36,0)">Strong and invasive painkillers may have to be administered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.37,0)">Contagion must be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Similarly, a global financial crisis of first magnitude requires prompt and decisive policy action, possibly of an unprecedented nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">When this crisis began, the European Central Bank was in the vanguard of the policy response, taking early and bold action to address financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">During the crisis, our exceptional measures – the ECB’s “enhanced credit support” – served to prevent a systemic liquidity crisis, enabled banks to continue functioning and helped to restore confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.95,0)">Second, medical experience tells us that, over time, the continued administration of strong painkillers can be harmful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.92,0)">They can create dependence - or even addiction - for the recipients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.28,0)">Such medicine cannot be a permanent solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.57,0)">It would eventually create new problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">By analogy, the exceptional support provided by central banks to the private sector must not degenerate into long-term dependence of the private sector on such support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.95,0)">For that reason, the current non-standard monetary policy measures will have to be progressively phased out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Enhanced credit support is not for eternity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Financial institutions must prepare themselves for an eventual withdrawal, which, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, will be timely and gradual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Third, looking forward, we know that “prevention is better than cure”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">“Preventive medicine” reduces the risk of future recurrence of the illness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Recent experience has offered important insights into how public policies and private incentives can be improved so as to reduce the chances of recurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Through preventive medicine, we must develop a fitter and healthier financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">So let me describe in more detail: how we have administered the “central bank medicine” to the financial system; how we envisage continuing the treatment going forward; and what lessons we are drawing for the future design of a preventive framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Emergency medicine: crisis management and ‘enhanced credit support’ It is natural to start with the “emergency treatment” that we have provided to the financial system throughout the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The alertness of the ECB was reflected in its actions from the very moment that financial tension first emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In August 2007 the ECB was the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In the ensuing months, we changed the timing and maturity of our liquidity provision, so as to support the functioning of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In addition, we offered foreign currency liquidity to our counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.19,0)">The intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008 brought soaring credit spreads, dramatic declines in trading and a spike in volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In short, the global financial system came close to seizing up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">Central banks stepped into the breach, addressing this unprecedented market failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The ECB was in the vanguard, acting to contain these tensions through both standard and non-standard policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.18,0)">In full consistency with our mandate to maintain price stability, the Governing Council reduced the ECB’s key interest rates rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.41,0)">The current very low level of interest rates is unprecedented throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Together with our credible anchoring of inflation expectations, these policy actions have resulted in a considerable easing of nominal and real monetary conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Moreover, we have gone beyond standard interest rate cuts by adopting several “non-standard” monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">As I have described in the past, collectively these measures embody our policy of “enhanced credit support”: fixed-rate full allotment; expansion of collateral; lengthening maturities of operations; liquidity provision in foreign currencies; and financial market support through a measured but significant covered bonds purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">This policy has been designed to support the flow of credit over and above what could be achieved through interest rate cuts alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Avoiding dependence and addiction: exit strategies Emergency treatment and strong medicines are sometimes necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.71,0)">But, if their use is prolonged, they can lead to dependence and even addiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.67,0)">Eventually, the administration of painkillers must be stopped if patients are to get back on their own two feet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This brings me to the exit from our non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.79,0)">The rationale for exit from these measures is the inverse of the rationale for their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We have introduced exceptional measures under exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.85,0)">These measures will have to be unwound when the situation normalises and the rationale for the measures fades away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The cornerstone of our exit strategy is its link to our primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Our actions throughout the crisis have been taken resolutely with this primary objective in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">Thus, any non-standard measure whose continuation would pose a threat to the achievement of price stability must be undone promptly and unequivocally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, looking ahead, not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Accordingly, we will make sure that the extraordinary liquidity measures taken are phased out in a timely and gradual fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">By so doing, we will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.61,0)">The financial system and individual institutions within it must act now to ensure that a future removal of central bank support can be managed without painful “withdrawal symptoms”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Preventive care: lessons from the crisis The overriding objective of someone recovering from a severe illness is not to suffer a relapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Unfortunately, there is no way of guaranteeing the avoidance of illness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">But “preventive medicine” is crucial in reducing the risk of recurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">We have to develop a new preventive framework to minimise the risk of recurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This framework will have both monetary policy and regulatory dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">‘Leaning against the wind’ in monetary policy Recent experience has reopened the debate about whether central banks should use interest rates to “lean against the wind” of asset price surges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.53,0)">Prior to the crisis, conventional wisdom was sceptical about such an approach for three main reasons: asset price misalignments or “bubbles” were seen as difficult to identify in real time; it was doubted that interest rate increases of a plausible magnitude could contain surging asset prices once these have achieved a momentum of their own; and third, it has been argued that any damage to the economy stemming from an asset price correction can be contained by prompt and aggressive monetary policy easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">With these considerations in mind, a “wait-and-see” approach was seen as preferable when addressing asset price surges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.62,0)">Having spoken on these issues in the past, I do not wish to enter into a detailed discussion of these arguments today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I only want to emphasise that recent experience has demonstrated the limitations of a wait-and-see approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.49,0)">Unprecedented policy action in response to the financial crisis could not prevent a sharp fall in economic activity, with all the consequences for the labour market, public finances and the society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.14,0)">Moreover, a wait-and-see approach risks creating moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">What is required is a more symmetric approach: one that leans against the emergence of asset price booms as well as dealing with the consequences of asset price busts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">By encouraging more responsible behaviour on the part of investors, such an approach should make such cycles of boom-bust less likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.28,0)">But substantial practical questions remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.37,0)">Clearly, central banks should not target, nor react mechanically to, asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Judgement is necessary in addressing asset price dynamics within an overall framework geared to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">At the ECB, our monetary policy strategy – with its medium-term orientation and focus on monetary and credit developments – offers such a framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It ensures that we consider the implications for price developments at longer horizons of financial imbalances and asset price misalignments, which may cumulate slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Therefore, while vindication is a strong word, we feel encouraged as regards our monetary policy strategy, whose underlying analysis we continuously deepen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Concluding remarks Let me mention that a number of institutional reforms to the supervisory framework within the European Union are currently being finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">We welcome the new macro-prudential aspects of this framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They will take concrete form in the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The ECB and the EU national central banks stand ready to provide the risk board with their full support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The Systemic Risk Board will endeavour to provide early warnings and issue recommendations that will help to prevent a renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Such warnings would have been useful in the past: they represent a crucial part of the preventive framework for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">While financial liberalisation, deregulation and innovation all have the potential to make our economies more productive and more resilient, the financial sector must not forget that it is to serve the real economy, not the other way around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">This, above all, requires a change in mentality within the financial industry itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Specifically, the financial industry has to increase transparency, strengthen its management of liquidity and risk, and make its business models more robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">As I mentioned, while maintaining the flow of finance to the real economy, financial institutions must continue to strengthen their balance sheets, by improving their capital and funding positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The future will no doubt bring further challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As concerns the authorities, we will continue to be alert and vigilant, as in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.18,0)">And our 330 million fellow citizens in the euro area will surely not tolerate a relapse into excessive risk-taking at the taxpayer’s expense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Therefore, the financial sector has to secure its future in a responsible and sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
