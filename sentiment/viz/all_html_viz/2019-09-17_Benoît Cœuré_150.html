    <span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)"> Luxembourg, 17 September 2019 Digital challenges to the international monetary and financial system Panel remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Banque centrale du Luxembourg-Toulouse School of Economics conference on “The Future of the International Monetary System” When  the euro was created 20 years ago it was hailed as one of the most important turning points in the history of the international monetary system since the demise of the Bretton Woods system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Many observers saw the euro as a natural contender to rival the supremacy of the US dollar in the global monetary and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">After all, the euro area was   the world’s largest trading bloc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The remarkable rise of China in the global economy, its expanding role in international trade, and the inclusion of the renminbi in 2016 in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Right   valuation basket, were widely heralded as yet another turning point for the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Yet, the US dollar remains the dominant international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.63,0)">It has defied all attempts to rival its monopoly position, even going back to the 1980s, when hopes that Japan’s emergence as global creditor would support the internationalisation of the yen were also disappointed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The US dollar today accounts for around half of global foreign exchange transactions worth 6.6 trillion dollars per day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It is used to invoice nearly half of global foreign trade, a share far greater than that of the United States in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And it is now as widely used as a reference unit for exchange rate arrangements as it was during the Bretton Woods era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">By some measures, it has taken on an even greater role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Today, the discussion is about so-called “stablecoins” – crypto-assets with value-stabilising characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Although private digital forms of money have been around for decades, Facebook’s large installed customer base suggests that Libra could be the first private initiative to have a truly global footprint from day one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Facebook has over 2.4 billion users – more than a quarter of the world population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook, have 1.6 billion and 1 billion users each.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Global “stablecoin” initiatives can make international payments cheaper and faster and support financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But they raise formidable challenges across a broad range of policy domains: operational robustness, safety and soundness as payment systems, customer protection, risks to financial stability and monetary sovereignty, and, last but not least, data protection and compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.44,0)">Some public authorities already expressed strong concerns, suggesting that regulatory hurdles will be set very high for these initiatives to get off the ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Partly in response to these concerns, a G7 working group has been mandated to examine global “stablecoins” in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The group is expected to provide policy recommendations to G7 Ministers and Governors by the time of the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in October this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Financial Stability Board has also started looking into the regulatory implications of these initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In my remarks this evening, I would like to discuss whether Libra, or similar global “stablecoin” initiatives, may be a contender for the Iron Throne of the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will start by discussing the factors that distinguish the discussion today from previous discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">I will argue that, in specific circumstances, and if allowed to develop, private digital forms of money could challenge the supremacy of the US dollar more easily, and faster, than currencies issued by other sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Yet, whatever fate awaits private digital money, they will likely change the international monetary and financial system in one way or another, either directly or by driving global central banks to innovate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.61,0)">Digitalisation and currency competition In the past century or so, competition for pre-eminence in the international monetary system has been confined to currencies issued by sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.27,0)">Economic size, openness and stability were long considered to be among the key determinants of the success and demise of international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The fact that the global appeal of the yen, the euro and the renminbi has not risen more forcefully is typically associated with one, or a combination of, these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.68,0)">In the case of the euro, for example, fragmented domestic capital markets and the absence of a true European safe asset – one that provides stability in challenging economic times – are likely to have prevented the euro from being used more widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There is a vast body of literature assessing the relative importance of these and other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The general consensus, however, is that other currencies continue to face considerable obstacles to displacing the US dollar in the international monetary and financial system, and that the broad contours of the system can be expected to remain unchanged in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This raises the question of whether the arrival of private digital forms of money could challenge the pecking order of the current system more easily – whether there is something special about these “currencies” that could allow them to compete more effectively with the US dollar, assuming of course that they passed the high bar set by global regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The short answer, in my view, is yes – for two main reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.05,0)">Inertial forces may become less powerful The first relates to the speed of adoption, or the potential for the system to change rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">Global currencies, much like domestic currencies, serve the three classic functions of money – a unit of account, a store of value and a means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">But not all functions are equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Both history and theory suggest that being a means of payment is, de facto, the leading function of a global currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.05,0)">In the past, however, international payments were mainly carried out by firms, merchants, banks and governments, and mainly took the form of wholesale transactions by large players in global trade and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The banks of Amsterdam and Hamburg, for example, performed key central bank functions as early as the beginning of the 17th century, and were created to provide giro deposits to merchants as an efficient and stable means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The pound sterling’s rise as an international currency started with so-called merchant banks in London lending to merchants to finance exports and imports, after which it developed into a vehicle for international investment and became a reserve currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.04,0)">For firms, merchants, banks and governments, there are material costs involved in agreeing on one international currency standard, and in switching from one to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">They often hold significant balances denominated in the leading international currency, and in doing so take on exchange rate risk, safe in the belief that this currency will remain the principal global payment unit in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.44,0)">As a result, inertia in international currency use has historically been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">High switching costs, lock-in effects and habit persistence were strong forces in favour of the status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.46,0)">There is an active debate as to how long it takes for one leading currency to replace another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the consensus is that the process takes years, if not decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.92,0)">Consumers, by contrast, have generally had much more limited exposure to, and interest in, global currency use, except in “dollarized” or “euroized” economies where the US dollar or the euro, are, or were, formal or informal means of payment in lieu of the domestic currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.65,0)">This has changed, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The most recent wave of globalisation, in conjunction with the rapid evolution of online services, has supported consumer demand for payment services that work across borders and that are also faster, cheaper and easier to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Global tourism flows, for instance, have doubled over the past 15 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The number of internet users has doubled too, as has the number of mobile phone users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The cost of sending data has shrunk considerably and access to more convenient services has widened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.95,0)">And in just ten years, global remittances have increased by over 50%, while cross-border e-commerce activity has trebled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is only natural, then, that new and emerging private payment solutions are mainly targeting consumers and workers, not merchants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Consumers and workers constitute a much larger pool of potential users, with the associated network effects, which has meant that existing digital initiatives have been adopted much more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Consider M-Pesa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It has revolutionised payments by making it possible to settle low-value transactions without a bank account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.61,0)">The volume of mobile money transactions in Kenya has trebled in less than seven years and today already accounts for half of the country’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Advanced economies are only starting to catch up with Kenya.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay, two payment solutions developed by domestic bigtech firms, have attracted almost one billion customers each in less than ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Bigtech payment services account for 16% of GDP in China, higher than anywhere else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Third-party mobile payment transactions last year in China were 15 times larger than in 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.9,0)">The available evidence therefore suggests that transaction and switching costs are much smaller in the case of retail consumer payments than they are for traditional currencies used for wholesale cross-border trade and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There is little reason to believe that such network effects would be less powerful for global networks, possibly making international currency competition a much more dynamic contest in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Drivers of international currency use in the digital age This brings me to my second point, namely that the factors driving international currency use are likely to change too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">With consumers at the heart of competition, we may have to rethink the set of factors, and their relative importance, that will ultimately determine the scale and scope of global currency adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Some fundamental drivers will not change, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Price stability remains, and will remain, a precondition for a currency to gain widespread use, whether digital or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For this reason, central banks worldwide have adopted price stability as their primary mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.45,0)">And this is why unstable crypto-assets, such as bitcoin, whose price in fiat currencies is highly volatile, will never be able to serve as a reliable means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">“Stablecoins”, if they meet their promise of stability, are the natural next step in the evolution of digital assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.01,0)">This was already understood nearly 50 years ago when Friedrich Hayek proposed abolishing the government monopoly on money issuance, arguing that competitive forces would exert disciplinary effects on issuers and incentivise them to provide stable money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Ultimately, the currency with the lowest inflation rate would crowd out its competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Next to stability, other factors are likely to play a growing role in the digital age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Convenience is a prime candidate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Consider the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Despite the creation of the single currency 20 years ago, cross-border e-commerce in the euro area has not taken off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Home bias remains strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.1,0)">Only one-third of European e-shoppers make purchases from sellers in other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.34,0)">And around 40% of European websites do not sell to consumers based in other member states, while almost 80% of online sales are domestic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Put differently, it is probably easier to connect a new currency to an existing network – the case of Libra – than to build a new network on an existing currency – the case of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Few retailers have seen the introduction of the euro as an opportunity to build a pan-European network around it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.09,0)">With or without the euro, the single market for services remains incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Global “stablecoin” initiatives could work in reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.09,0)">They could turn the nature of payments on its head.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.27,0)">WhatsApp, for example, is a messaging service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Adding a payment leg that enables direct transfers of money between registered users will not change the nature of its business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">But it will provide a platform to turn a means of payment into a global currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.33,0)">This is the exact opposite of what theoretical models of global currency use would predict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">According to these models, payments lead and other uses follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A second, and related, new driver of international currency use in the digital age relates to privacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.02,0)">Historically, privacy was not an issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">Anonymity is one of the salient features of paper money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.25,0)">Private digital currencies that run through a distributed ledger have arguably restored anonymity in the virtual world, making them prone to being used to finance illegal activities, such as tax evasion or terrorism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To pass the test of faith, therefore, any “stablecoin” initiative will have to conform to international anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But assuming they do comply with the applicable regulations, “stablecoins” could differentiate themselves according to how much personal data they collect and process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">Some could use or sell customer data, whereas others may give priority to protecting the privacy of their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.39,0)">It is hard to tell just how much the privacy dimension will affect international currency use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But the effects could also work in reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are significant differences across countries in terms of how much consumers value the privacy of their data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In Europe, individuals’ control over their personal data has been protected by an EU regulation – the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR – since May 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">Any private initiative operating in the EU will have to comply with this regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The future shape of the international monetary and financial system All this means that digitalisation may significantly change the way currencies compete with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.17,0)">It also means that it will become much more difficult to predict the future contours of the international monetary and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">Several equilibria are conceivable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I would like to briefly discuss three of them, each with very different implications for the future shape of our international monetary and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.74,0)">Preserving the status quo A first possible equilibrium may simply be the status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.2,0)">Concerns expressed about Libra in large parts of the world, including in the United States, has been considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.51,0)">Some governments have already announced their intention to ban Libra, if and when it gets up and running.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.13,0)">In other words, the standards required to preserve safety against theft, fraud and operational failures may prove too demanding, or too costly, for many initiatives to get off the ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.66,0)">This equilibrium would not imply a digital standstill, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Other initiatives can help meet growing consumer demand for payment services that work across borders and that are faster, cheaper and easier to use than current payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Libra has undoubtedly been a wake-up call for central banks to strengthen their efforts to improve existing payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This by itself is undoubtedly a win-win situation for the global community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Progress made by those central banks already operating at the technological frontier can be expected to increase the speed of technological diffusion across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Europe is leading by example here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In November last year, for example, the Eurosystem launched Target Instant Payment Settlement   – a new market infrastructure which allows payment service providers to offer funds transfers to customers across Europe in real time, around the clock, and on every day of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">TIPS could be a role model for developing economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It not only has the potential to help better prepare incumbents for the challenges arising from digital giants, it has also the potential to be a catalyst for financial inclusion, which should be a key objective of any public initiative in the payment field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Central bank digital currencies A second, and related, equilibrium is what Bank of England Governor Mark Carney recently called a synthetic hegemonic currency that is provided through a network of central bank digital currencies – CBDCs for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Many central banks have been working on CBDCs in recent years, though at differing speeds, depending on differences in demand for cash by citizens, among others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Sveriges Riksbank and the Central Bank of Uruguay, for example, are among the most advanced central banks in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Their experiments with the “e-krona” and “e-peso” provide useful food for thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The People’s Bank of China has also reportedly accelerated plans for its own digital currency in response to Libra.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The costs and benefits of issuing a global synthetic currency have been discussed since John Maynard Keynes’ Bancor proposal and are far beyond the scope of this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.91,0)">In fact, they have little to do with new technology, and everything to do with appetite for global economic cooperation, which has been low since the demise of the Bretton Woods system – many would argue that it is even lower today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">But cooperation is precisely what Governor Carney is calling for: closer central bank coordination to reap the benefits of recent technological advances more quickly and more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Much in this spirit, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have already joined forces to examine the possible use of distributed ledger technology in financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The next natural step would be for global central banks to join forces and jointly investigate the feasibility of CBDCs based on common technical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.21,0)">Digital currency areas The third equilibrium that I would like to briefly sketch out would be more disruptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It would be in the spirit of what Markus Brunnermeier, Harold James and Jean-Pierre Landau have called “digital currency areas” that would cut across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Digital currency areas are networks where payments and transactions are made digitally by using a currency specific to the network – be it a fiat currency or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In this hypothetical world, policymakers would successfully coordinate across borders to ensure that global private payment system providers fully comply with key policy priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">At one extreme, cooperation would cut across continents and lay the ground for the rise of a truly global private digital currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.67,0)">This would be a long way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.23,0)">Today, even networks such as Facebook, Amazon or Alipay remain confined to geographical blocks, and this is before a discussion on regulatory aspects around payment systems has even started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">More conceivable are therefore digital regional currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Given the already high degree of regulatory and economic convergence, Europe is certainly best placed to advance here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But others might follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.92,0)">This equilibrium would, however, entail a risk of fragmentation of the international monetary system, and the transition towards it would pose several challenges to public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.15,0)">Currency substitution would be one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.32,0)">The “stablecoinisation” would likely start in economies with stubbornly high inflation or weak institutions – Gresham’s law in reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">The decline in the prime legal tender would, in turn, undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy in these economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.58,0)">But unlike “traditional” currency substitution, “stablecoinisation” would potentially relegate key policies that belong to the public sphere to private payment system providers – an outcome which citizens clearly cannot accept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.39,0)">Global “stablecoins” would likely also increase capital flow volatility, with potential effects on exchange rates and financial conditions, and hence on domestic inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Small open economies, for example, could seek to introduce or increase capital controls to limit or offset such fluctuations, in particular if capital flows are one-sided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In other jurisdictions with deep and liquid financial markets, purchases of safe assets by global “stablecoin” issuers could compress term premia by increasing scarcity, and thereby reinforce or offset the actions taken by domestic central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.95,0)">In other words, the journey towards digital currency areas would be long and full of perils.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">Ultimately, however, the shape of the international monetary and financial system would be determined by two factors: the citizens’ appetite for being part of global networks, or not, and differences in tastes and preferences, including about privacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.84,0)">Conclusion Wherever our journey takes us, and with this I would like to conclude, global “stablecoin” initiatives, such as Libra, will prove disruptive in one way or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">They are the natural result of rapid technological progress, globalisation and shifting consumer preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But how we respond to these challenges is up to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We can focus our efforts on ensuring that private payment systems will thrive in a space that respects our common global policy priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Or we can accelerate our own efforts to overcome the remaining weaknesses in global payment systems, safe in the belief that only public money can ultimately, and collectively, ensure a safe store of value, a credible unit of account and a stable means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Or we can do both of these things, and create an environment in which market-based and public payment systems effectively complement each other, jointly shaping the payments universe in the 21st century.</span>
