    <span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)"> Dinner speech on the Eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation at the ECB Workshop on “Monetary Policy Implementation: lessons from the past and challenges ahead” Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main 20 January 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, I appreciate very much that you have accepted our invitation to attend this workshop and the dinner tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You are here in a place which is one of the very few official buildings of Frankfurt which was considerably, but not completely destroyed during the war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is called Alte Oper and was financed partly by the wealthy citizens of Frankfurt in the late 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Today it is used as a concert hall and for bringing together people in a beautiful environment after meetings in sober towers like the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Several major central banks have undertaken or are considering changes to their monetary policy operational framework, the timing should make the workshop even more informative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">As a young central bank we sometimes turn to history to look for guidance and there it reads: “Many persons believe that the Bank of England has some peculiar power of fixing the value of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.19,0)">They see that the Bank of England varies its minimum rate of discount from time to time, and that, more or less, all other banks follow its lead, and charge much as it charges; and they are puzzled why this should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.51,0)">“Money”, as economists teach, “is a commodity, and only a commodity;” why then, it is asked, is its value fixed in so odd a way, and not the way in which the value of all other commodities is fixed?” So far W. Bagehot in Lombard Street around 1850.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The emerging consensus?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">The answer to this question – how is the CB interest rate transmitted to the banking system is at the core of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In recent years, a strong consensus on monetary policy implementation has emerged in central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The consensus can be summarized in three brief points Short term interest rates are accepted as the only operational target of the central bank The choice of monetary policy implementation can be made independent of monetary policy strategy The consensus implies some preferences on the use of monetary policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For example, standing facilities should be offered with unlimited access, reverse operations are the preferred tool for open market operations and reserve requirements are favored to deal with transitory liquidity shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Although the main instruments for monetary policy are available to almost all central banks, few central banks tend to use them in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">History can be an important factor in explaining some of these differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is also worthwhile to recall that the consensus in central banking to target short term interest rates only and avoid targeting monetary aggregates is relatively recent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This recent consensus may also explain why no single normative model for monetary policy implementation has yet emerged.”Hands off” and “hands on” approach coexist as tested alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">Prof. Issing has explained the history why the ECB has chosen the “hands off” approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The challenges Having identified the consensus and its possible manifestations in different approaches to implementation, it is also useful to reflect on the challenges facing central bankers when dealing with implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I have identified three challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">the management of the volatility of short term interest rates determining the optimal size and composition of central bank balance sheet the appropriate level of communication with the financial markets contribute to further integration of financial markets by harmonising and expanding collateral instruments In terms of volatility, central banks must identify the extent to which they will permit the short-term interest rate to deviate from the target rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.68,0)">Policymakers must be clear about the costs and benefits of too much or conversely too little volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The ECB continues to target neutral liquidity conditions and works on the improvement of its own liquidity forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This helps banks in their decision to bid for their liquidity needs, reduces uncertainty and volatility and makes fine tuning in money markets less necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">When I joined the Austrian Central Bank as a young economist, I realised three things: Textbooks were not of too much value when you try to understand the most relevant markets for the central bank, like the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.49,0)">Economists and treasurers did not always agree on the explanations for imbalances and interest rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.18,0)">Clearing the market could mean early morning calls to the major banks and sometimes ad hoc transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.69,0)">Today the world is more complex, and although our knowledge may have improved, the steering of the money market appears as challenging as in the past: Still, text books on monetary policy are only of limited use to understand the practice of implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, quite some journal articles and working papers were published in the last decade which model the money market in an insightful way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Also, one of our colleagues, Ulrich Bindseil, has recently published a book in which he explains the evolution of thinking in the field of monetary policy implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.22,0)">At least in the euro area, the money market has become highly competitive, and morning calls to major banks certainly do no longer the job of clearing the market and influencing short term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Deeper knowledge of the economics of incomplete information and game theory is helpful to better understand the factors driving short term interest rates, and the formation of expectations of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.28,0)">Central banks, and in particular the ECB, have simplified and enhanced transparency of monetary policy implementation enormously over the past two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Two aspects may be highlighted: First, there is no longer any doubt that short term interest rates are the operational target of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Open market operations, standing facilities and reserve requirement are thus all used to steer short term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Second, the ECB, as some other central banks, shares information on its liquidity forecasts and “neutral” allotment amounts in refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Despite this higher transparency towards the market, we have not succeeded in avoiding volatility of rates during the last week of the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.72,0)">Maybe we even need to recognise that transparency sometimes may contribute to volatility of short term rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.54,0)">In communicating too much information, the central bank may introduce an additional source of noise that could generate volatility in the overnight rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Our preferred approach would be that the market would be able to deal with variations in the liquidity balance by itself, for instance in an averaging framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">Supporting the money market As mentioned earlier, aside from the design of the operational framework, the overall functioning of the money markets in toto is a direct concern of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The central bank wishes to see highly developed and liquid money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Such conditions allied with strong settlement infrastructure facilitate the development of interbank trading which enhances the efficiency of market and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">One of the tasks of the ECB is the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">An enhanced system TARGET2 should be available from the start of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This consolidates the technical infrastructure of TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This should give a tool to banks to improve their liquidity management and the efficiency of the money market in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This also facilitates an efficient transmission of monetary policy signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.47,0)">The euro area repo market segment is less integrated than the swap and unsecured segments, due to still existing differences in practices, laws, regulations and fragmentation of market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Here, continued efforts for more integration are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The ECB has a keen interest and actively supports this integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">For example, the Euribor ACI initiative to facilitate the integration of the euro market for short-term securities   has been actively supported by the Eurosystem since its inception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This leads me to a final observation on implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">It is crucial for the success of implementation that both central bank and credit institutions work together to ensure smooth implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">It is vital that banks have confidence in the central banks ability to implement monetary policy in a reliable, efficient and transparent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.01,0)">Without this confidence in the central bank, implementation would become cumbersome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Concluding remarks To conclude, I would like to make three remarks: First, the design of the operational framework is an important component of successful monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">If I may suggest, the academic community could be important partners along with the practitioners to explore the idea of a normative model for implementing monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, the existence of a variety of approaches to implementing monetary policy with different emphasises on the three core monetary policy instruments   show that there is not yet recognised one definitive way to implement policy, instead the plurality of approaches prevails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Innovations of today over time could become the appropriate solution for ones own central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Thirdly, a crucial part of the efficient money market is confidence of banks in the central bank to deliver smooth liquidity conditions and clear monetary policy signals that are implemented efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We will continue to listen to the views of the market participants, and we will actively seek their comments, whenever opportune.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In the same vein, we are interested in participating to the more theoretical discussions and we support the research work that is being done in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And we look forward to continuing our exchange of experience with our partner central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">I hope you will find the second part of the workshop tomorrow fruitful and worth coming to Frankfurt!</span>
