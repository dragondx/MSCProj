    <span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)"> Three courses for a dinner speech Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Speech given at the Annual Gala Dinner of the Association of International Savings Banks, in London on 25 June 1999 Thank you for inviting me to attend this Annual Gala Dinner as guest of honour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Without a doubt, I shall try to make good use of this opportunity to address the banking community here in London.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Considering both your organisation and my institution, the Association of International Savings Banks in London and the European Central Bank  , we can find a large selection of tasty ingredients - savings, international banking, the euro, London, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">- that I intend to combine to create a delicious dinner speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.16,0)">Do not worry: I shall not speak for more than one and a half hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First course: "savings" Although I am aware that savings banks today do not only concentrate on savings, but have also managed to develop all kinds of banking activities, allow me to discuss the importance of savings for the European economies as the first course of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The ultimate goal of our institutions - savings banks and central banks - is to provide good services to the public in order to fulfil their needs and to improve their living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We should never forget that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The key idea on how to accomplish this aim is to increase productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">To increase productivity we need more investment in human capital, research, machinery and new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">To finance this investment we require savings and channels for allocating these savings to the best possible users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We, savings banks and central banks, have a shared responsibility to promote savings and allocate them via the market to the best investment projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.87,0)">Of course, central banks cannot generate savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We are liquidity providers, not savings providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">We should not confuse savings with liquidity; they are different economic concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.64,0)">Savings refer to a real variable  , whereas liquidity refers to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The right bridge between the two concepts has a wonderful name: stability, which is, precisely, the main responsibility of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">By promoting stability, central banks avoid any misalignment between liquidity and savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The art of central banking consists in, among other things, providing the banking system with the correct amount of liquidity given the level of savings or, in other words, trying to keep the market rates and the so-called natural rates of interest as close as possible, in Wicksell's wording.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">In so doing, central banks promote stability and, at the same time, foster savings, because stability is the best environment to make savings worthwhile, as they maintain their value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The art of savings banking consists in, among other things, channelling the demand for savings to the best investment opportunities in accordance with market rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In conclusion, savings banks and central banks, you and the ECB, are allies in paving a road which has many milestones: stability, savings, the channelling of savings, markets, efficient investment, increasing productivity and, last but not least, improving living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In order to reach the end of the road, we need to avoid "leaks" in the circuit of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Low interest rates should not be understood as an invitation to invest abroad but rather as a low-cost opportunity to promote business in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In order to achieve this goal, governments should provide the best conditions for promoting business activity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.81,0)">Main course: "stability" The title of the main course of my dinner speech could be "stability above all else".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Stability is the touchstone with which to measure the success of the euro and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">With an inflation rate of 1.1%, far below the conventional limit of 2%, there can be no doubt about the success of our currency and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I do not need to remind you of the advantages and positive consequences of stability in terms of economic efficiency, economic growth and social justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I should also like to add that it is a real success to be keeping the inflation rate below 2% with such historically low interest rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is what I would call achieving and maintaining price stability at low cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These are the credentials of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">On the other hand, the success of a currency and a central bank, the success of the euro and the ECB, cannot be measured through the evolution of its exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.55,0)">As with any other feeling, concern is of a subjective nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I do not mind acknowledging that my personal feelings are of no concern when it comes to the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro vis-Ã -vis other currencies, for many reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.21,0)">Our economy is a rather closed one; therefore the effect of exchange rate fluctuation is much less relevant than it was for our former national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">If someone should ask me what is the value of a euro, my answer would be that one euro is worth one euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The depreciation of the euro does not pose any risk of inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It is not the consequence of economic imbalances in the euro area economy; on the contrary, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound: low inflation, an external current account surplus, lower fiscal deficits and progress towards flexibility and a market-oriented economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">What really matters to European citizens is that the euro is a currency firmly based on internal price stability, in a better position to maintain its purchasing power than other currencies in the world   and, therefore, with clear potential for a stronger external value because, in the medium term, internal stability and external value are linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Dessert: "sweets: London, United Kingdom" Finally the dessert of my dinner speech relates to London and the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.52,0)">As you can imagine, the institutional position of the ECB - and therefore my own official position - concerning the United Kingdom joining the euro area is one of strict neutrality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.86,0)">This is an issue which has to be decided by the British people, whenever and in whatever way they deem appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Without prejudice to the ECB or to my own neutrality, allow me to say, nevertheless, that there is no doubt that a currency such as the euro, which is bound to play an important role in the international economy, needs a sound economic and financial basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The euro would, therefore, benefit from having in its domain "habitat" an economy as important as that of Britain, with a financial centre as important as London, the financial hub of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Let me add that I am also convinced that in the age of economic and financial globalisation, the United Kingdom and London would also benefit from joining what is - for the time being - the second largest economic and monetary area in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I should like to conclude by expressing my opinion on only one of the arguments against the United Kingdom joining the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.16,0)">I am referring to the demagogic, misleading and even dangerous argument that the depreciation of the euro may be understood as a failure of the ECB and the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Euro sceptics should find other reasons to justify the option of isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.64,0)">But why have I even described it as dangerous?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Because the issue at stake is not only the euro or the ECB, it is the whole Single Market project and the European Union in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The future of the ECB and the euro are inevitably linked to the future of the European project.</span>
