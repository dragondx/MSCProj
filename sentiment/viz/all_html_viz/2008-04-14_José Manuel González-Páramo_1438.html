    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.35,0)"> Whither liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Developments, policies and challenges Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB28th Nomura Central Bankers Seminar Tokyo, 14 April 2008 Introduction   Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Tokyo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">I would like to thank the organisers of this important event, the 28th Nomura Central Bankers Seminar, for giving me the opportunity to share with such a distinguished audience some considerations about the role of liquidity in the recent market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.36,0)">The current turmoil in financial markets has been to a very large extent about “liquidity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.93,0)">Since August 2007 the different phases of the turmoil have been marked by repeated disruptions to the traditional mechanisms of liquidity creation and transmission, both at the aggregate and at the individual level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.29,0)">From the start of the turmoil we have experienced several episodes of contraction in the degree of liquidity of a variety of money and credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">Some of these episodes have been experienced in the market for inter-bank unsecured loans, a key component of the money market and the starting point of the monetary transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.69,0)">Moreover, liquidity has also dried up in the market for mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper as well as for structured credit products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.98,0)">And, occasionally, poor liquidity conditions have been reported in markets for securities historically regarded as very liquid and safe, such as the market for banks’ covered bonds or, even, the government bonds of some developed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.84,0)">Indeed, at some points in time over the last few months we have observed rises in order-based measures of liquidity risk for a variety of money and credit markets and declines in traded volumes that could be explained only by the existence of severe stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.18,0)">At the individual level, liquidity shortages have taken a toll on a limited number of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my intervention, I would like to first recall some of the main issues related to liquidity and banks’ liquidity management that have played a central role during the ongoing market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Second, I will briefly review recent developments in liquidity in credit and money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Third, I will describe some of the actions that central banks - and, particularly, the European Central Bank   ­- have undertaken to mitigate disruptions to the traditional channels of liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Finally, I will attempt to draw some preliminary lessons on liquidity management and present some of the public and private initiatives that are currently under discussion in order to reinforce the industry and regulatory framework for liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Liquidity issues The multi-faceted nature of liquidity Before moving on, it may be worth agreeing on a working definition of the term “liquidity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">Indeed, this term is often used to indicate many different things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.19,0)">This is a problem that has been pointed out by several contributors to a recent volume of Banque de France’s Financial Stability Review on liquidity issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.24,0)">For instance, Charles Goodhart notes in his contribution that the difficulty to define liquidity clearly is due to the multi-faceted nature of liquidity itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.95,0)">Less charitably, Jean Tirole blames the problem on the “unfortunate habit of economists” to use this term to cover different concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">While some economists may argue that the specific meaning of the term becomes clear once it is put into context  , it is worth striving for more clarity in the use of the notion of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.24,0)">Since I realise that this may sound like a criticism to the profession’s practice, let me come clean by admitting to the same unfortunate habit of using the same term for different purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">Indeed, I have to acknowledge that at the ECB we refer to liquidity to describe conditions and notions at different levels   that are distinct from each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So, as a sign of repentance, let me attempt to clarify these different notions and make the firm resolution to stick to them, at least until the end of this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">In the context of the properties of an individual financial instrument, the notion of liquidity typically refers to the ability of trading such instrument   without unduly affecting its price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, an asset is described as highly liquid, thereby entailing limited liquidity risk, if it is reasonable to assume that it can be easily sold without incurring a loss of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The notion can also be used to characterise an entire market, also to reflect co-movement in liquidity across assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In this case, we refer to the ability to trade or liquidate positions in a market without significantly affecting the prevailing market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">The degree of liquidity of the market for a financial asset is a function of a variety of factors, including: its outstanding size; the relative size, frequency and modalities of transactions; the number and quality of market participants; the relevance of transaction costs; the amount and quality of information on prices, traded volumes and, more fundamentally, on the degree of security of the asset and of credit-worthiness of counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Thus, a market in which trades can be smoothly executed thanks to the stable presence of numerous buyers and sellers willing to undertake large transactions at narrow bid-offer spreads is generally regarded as highly liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.89,0)">Going back to the issue of the different notions of liquidity, from the start of the turmoil we have also heard reports about liquidity   of specific individual financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.43,0)">In these reports, liquidity problems at specific individual banks are usually referred to as equivalent to difficulties in funding their business activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Indeed, an additional notion of liquidity refers to the ability of a firm  : to convert its assets into cash by disposing of them or borrowing against their value in order to meet expected and unexpected obligations, or to issue liabilities in order to raise funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">The degree of funding liquidity of a firm may depend on a number of factors, notably the amount of liquid assets it holds and the liquidity of the credit and securities markets it relies on for its external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The last observation points to the fact that, while the different notions of liquidity   are conceptually distinct, they are in practice interrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.6,0)">Indeed, some authors have developed models in which market and funding liquidity reinforce each other, leading to the emergence of “liquidity spirals” that may account for some of the declines in the liquidity of markets and individual institutions observed in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Aggregate liquidity Before closing the subject of how to define liquidity, let me briefly recall that there is a more aggregate notion - that should be fairly familiar to this audience of experts on the Japanese economy and Bank of Japan’s Quantitative Easing Policy - that is often used to describe monetary developments at the macroeconomic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">Indeed, liquidity is often used as a synonymous for money supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.78,0)">In particular, at the ECB we use the term “excess liquidity” to indicate the existence of a stock of money relative to income in excess of the level needed to finance non-inflationary growth in the medium term  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.49,0)">Of course, even this notion of liquidity is not entirely unrelated to those mentioned above, since money supply measures are derived from the consolidated balance sheet of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">However, it is important not to confuse references to liquidity in the context of liquidity management   with the aggregate money holding behaviour of agents other than banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.51,0)">Market and funding liquidity risks As I mentioned above, the liquidity of a financial instrument may vary over time, and may become severely impaired under conditions of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.31,0)">Uncertainty about liquidity implies that market participants face the risk that it may not be possible to execute a transaction when they wish to do so due to the lack of counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.34,0)">For instance, a market participant may not be able to sell a security or liquidate a position due to lack of buyers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.71,0)">Similarly, firms   face the risk of being unable to obtain enough cash to meet their obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This funding liquidity risk is particularly relevant for banks since their core business involves the maturity transformation of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, the traditional activity of banks consists of providing liquidity transformation services, by collecting short-term deposits in order to finance the provision of loans with longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.71,0)">As a result, banks intrinsically face a maturity mismatch in their balance sheets that exposes them to funding liquidity risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.38,0)">Under supposedly extreme circumstances  , the maturity mismatch may even imply the risk of a bank run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.61,0)">This may happen if large numbers of depositors perceive liquidity conditions   at a specific institution as untenable and rush to withdraw their deposits in waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Several mechanisms and policies have been developed over time for the prevention and resolution of bank runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These include deposit insurance schemes  , regulatory and supervisory policies   and the possible recourse to emergency liquidity assistance from the central bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The “originate and hold” vs. “originate to distribute” models The characterisation of the liquidity risks faced by banks I have made so far conforms to the so-called “originate and hold” business model, according to which banks create loans to firms and households and hold them to maturity in their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">However, in recent decades, many banks have taken advantage of financial innovation and of developments in securitisation to progressively shift towards the so-called “originate to distribute” model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Under this new model, banks originate loans but sell them to structured investment vehicles   to be repackaged and subsequently sold as asset-backed securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In principle, this business model is attractive for banks since it provides them with a new source of financing to expand lending  , while also allowing them to economise on costly capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In fact, it has been argued that regulatory capital arbitrage has been one of the main reasons why banks have adopted the “originate to distribute” model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Also from the point of view of the economy as a whole, the “originate to distribute” model could be viewed as having many advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">First, being capital costly, the ability to sustain a given level of credit supply with a lower volume of capital enables the banking sector to reduce the costs of financing for borrowers and favours financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Moreover, it may be seen as representing a step towards more complete credit markets, thereby contributing to enhancing the efficiency of the economic system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In addition, the securitisation of loans in principle could reduce a secular source of vulnerability of the economies, by taking risk concentrations associated with loan portfolios away from the banking sector and spreading them more broadly across other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a result, the “originate to distribute” model may potentially diminish the likelihood of the credit busts and banking crises that have historically been a major source of macroeconomic and financial instability in many economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It should be noted though that, even before the outbreak of financial market turmoil, some commentators have voiced doubts about some of the welfare-enhancing effects of the “originate to distribute” model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">For instance it has been argued that, while securitisation certainly spreads existing risks, it may in fact encourage the creation of further risks, particularly by relaxing the incentives for banks to screen and monitor borrowers in order to alleviate the informational asymmetries associated with credit contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">More generally, it has been questioned whether the securitisation of loans may not perversely shift risk concentrations to sectors potentially more vulnerable than those that originated them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.23,0)">In this regard, I remember reading a few years ago in the Bank of Japan’s Financial Stability Review that in Japan credit derivatives based on loans originated by large and relatively well-capitalised commercial banks had been acquired by small regional financial institutions with significantly weaker balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.16,0)">Also in the course of the current turmoil, we noticed that some of the individual European banks affected by exposures to the sub-prime mortgage market were relatively small institutions without the necessary technical expertise or balance sheet strength to withstand them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.44,0)">In addition, for many banks all over the world, risks do not seem to have travelled farther away than the balance sheets of their own conduits, and have been internalised again once the market turmoil erupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.76,0)">While this certainly does not mean that securitisation is not potentially welfare-enhancing, it suggests that - in the environment of historically low returns on traditional securities and an implied imprudent hunt for yield that preceded the turmoil – the markets for asset-backed securities and credit derivatives may have failed to spread risks as effectively as expected and have, by contrast, exacerbated information asymmetries, probably as a result of their opacity and the complexity of the underlying contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">More generally, the events of the last few months have revealed that, while the adoption of the “originate to distribute” model relieves banks from traditional funding liquidity risks and “liquefies” their lending-related assets, it increases their exposure to the risk of market illiquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Indeed, this model relies on the assumption that banks are able to dispose of mortgage loans in the form of repackaged asset-backed securities, which presupposes the existence of highly liquid wholesale markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.83,0)">As it is by now well known, over the last few months liquidity has become severely limited in a number of markets playing a key role for the execution of the liquidity risk management strategies of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.84,0)">This has particularly affected banks pursuing very aggressive strategies of maturity transformation that rely on the continuing issuance of asset-backed commercial paper at short maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">To illustrate this point, we only need to recall the start of the current market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.08,0)">The deterioration of the US sub-prime mortgage market led to the drying up of liquidity in the markets for mortgage-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.62,0)">These developments led to liquidity funding difficulties at the structured investment vehicles   specialised in purchasing mortgage loans from banks and transforming them into mortgage-backed securities for their subsequent sale to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.61,0)">Liquidity funding problems at SIVs translated into analogous problems at banks as they were no longer able to dispose of their stocks of mortgage loans, while facing unexpected obligations arising from contingent credit lines and, in some cases, also from the prospects of being forced to incorporate struggling associated off-balance sheet SIVs into their own balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">Uncertainty about future obligations among individual banks led to significantly increased precautionary demand for liquidity, which – together with asymmetric information – resulted in severely diminished liquidity in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.98,0)">How has liquidity been affected by the turmoil I have anticipated already some of the developments in liquidity from the start of the current market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me now review them more in detail in the remainder of this section.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.25,0)">As you are well aware, in July and early August a series of events led to an intensification of the tensions in the US sub-prime mortgage market and a sharp decline in the degree of risk appetite of global investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Market volatility increased across almost all financial asset classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.82,0)">Stock prices declined as investors sold equities and moved funds into safe-haven investment assets, such as government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.1,0)">In this context, several investment funds holding asset-backed securities suspended withdrawals from their clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the same time, a number of European banks made their direct or indirect exposures to the US mortgage market, particularly to its sub-prime component, public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">In this environment, market liquidity declined for a number of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.97,0)">This was most obvious for the markets directly related to the core of the current turmoil, namely the market for sub-prime mortgage-backed securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.44,0)">However, during the turmoil, the problem of illiquidity spread much further, first affecting other ABSs and asset-backed commercial paper  , then mortgage-backed securities and basically all structured credit instruments, such as collateralised debt obligations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The market for government bonds is the only fixed income market in which liquidity has remained fairly good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.95,0)">It should, however, be noted that within the euro area there has certainly been a differentiation among different government bonds: while German Bunds have generally remained quite liquid, the liquidity of bonds issued by countries with weaker public finances, such as Italy and Greece, has at certain points in time become heavily impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.11,0)">This has also had an impact on the yield spreads between these government bonds and the benchmark Bunds, which in some cases have widened to their highest levels since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.72,0)">In money markets the impact of the turmoil was initially felt mainly in the longer-dated unsecured inter-bank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.39,0)">It can be said that liquidity in the unsecured deposit markets almost completely dried-up in maturities beyond 1-month  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.1,0)">These frictions eventually spilled over to the very short-term money markets  , at first in the US dollar market, where banks – particularly, from Europe – encountered difficulties in raising short-term liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.17,0)">Early in the morning of Thursday 9 August, the tensions spread to the short-term euro money market   triggering an exceptional liquidity-injecting operation of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.27,0)">Important factors driving these adverse liquidity developments in the unsecured market were general uncertainty about banks’ sub-prime exposures and the scope for related write-downs resulting in declining lack of mutual confidence within the banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.12,0)">Indeed, rising adverse selection together with increased precautionary demand for liquidity, nearly led in august 2007 to the euro money market providing a real-life illustration of Akerlof’s “market for lemons” prediction of how information asymmetries in a market with uncertainty about the quality of goods   may lead to a decline in trading and, potentially, to the collapse of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.89,0)">Interestingly, also the liquidity in the secured non-government repurchase agreement   markets was heavily impacted, as many banks no longer wanted to accept the types of securities mentioned above   as underlying collateral in repo transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.21,0)">As a result, only the repo markets based on government bonds remained fairly liquid, but even in these markets the degree of price differentiation across repos secured with different types of government bonds was larger than normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.72,0)">Another market segment that saw a partial   deterioration of liquidity conditions is the foreign exchange swap market, which is very important for banks managing liquidity in different currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.62,0)">In particular at times when many banks were keen on obtaining USD liquidity, most market participants tried to swap other currencies into dollars, while hardly any bank was willing to provide the USD funds to the extent that the market became dysfunctional for maturities beyond 1 week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.1,0)">Actions of central banks: What has the ECB done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.93,0)">What have other central banks done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">From the start of the market turmoil, the ECB has undertaken a variety of liquidity management operations - in some cases in coordination with other major central banks - in order to mitigate the disruptions to those segments of the money market that are under its direct influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The ECB’s liquidity interventions have been accompanied by an intensification of its communication policy, with two main purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">First, in order to maintain inflation expectations firmly anchored at a time when risks to price stability have been clearly tilted to the upside, it has proven essential to stress the separation between monetary policy and liquidity management policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In addition, given the rather technical nature of issues related to liquidity management and the relative lack of familiarity of the general public with them, more intense communication has been needed to prevent and correct occasional misunderstandings in the financial press about the scale, modalities and objectives of our liquidity operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.67,0)">In fact, observers often fail to notice that the magnitude and nature of a central bank’s liquidity management interventions is very much conditional on the structural features of its operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.14,0)">Therefore, impressionistic comparisons among interventions from different central banks, abstracting from the structural differences in their frameworks, do not necessarily serve well the public’s interest in assessing policy responses to the market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s operational framework Thus, before explaining what the ECB has done, let me briefly outline some elements of the Eurosystem’s operational framework that have proved crucial to enable it to continue influencing short-term money market rates in spite of the difficult situation in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The operational framework of the Eurosystem has been chosen with great care to function both in normal and stressed times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It aims at steering short-term money market rates close to the key policy rate - the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations   - in a smooth and efficient manner, with the primary aim of implementing the monetary policy decisions of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It consists of elements that are regularly employed and those that can be activated should the need arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, this framework comprises three categories of instruments: 1) open market operations, 2) minimum reserve requirements and 3) standing facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">Even though open market operations include several different operations, the Eurosystem has so far almost exclusively conducted two types:   refinancing operations, through which liquidity is temporarily lent to counterparties against eligible collateral and at a minimum bid rate which signals the monetary policy stance; and   the collection of fixed-term deposits   for fine-tuning purposes, which are used to temporarily absorb   liquidity from   counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, banks must hold a certain amount of liquidity to fulfil their reserve requirements  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.3,0)">This requirement needs to be fulfilled on average over each reserve maintenance period, which is approximately one month long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The Eurosystem offers on each operating day two standing facilities which can be accessed at the discretion of individual banks, namely a deposit facility and a marginal lending facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.9,0)">At their own initiative, banks can place liquidity in the deposit facility on an overnight basis, at a rate which is decided by the Governing Council and is normally one percentage point below the ECB’s key policy rate, while they can borrow overnight liquidity against eligible collateral via the marginal lending facility at a rate which is normally one percentage point above the policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Through these instruments, the Eurosystem manages liquidity conditions in the euro area money market so as to steer very short-term interbank money market rates as close as possible to the level of the policy rate decided by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Eurosystem’s open market operations during the financial market turmoil In the context of the current market turmoil, the primary aims of the ECB’s liquidity management policy have been:   as in normal times, to keep the overnight rate as close as possible to the minimum bid rate;   in addition, to ensure the smooth functioning of the money market, also at term maturities, by facilitating access to liquidity to solvent credit institutions, thereby helping them to meet their liquidity needs in a smooth manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">By doing so, the ECB has intended to contribute to re-establishing confidence among market participants and to safeguard financial stability and the appropriate functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In line with these aims, during the recent period of financial market volatility, the Eurosystem has implemented a variety of measures, which can be summarized as follows: First it has made some relatively small adjustments to the modalities of its supply of euro liquidity by changing: the distribution of liquidity supplied to the market within the reserve maintenance period without, however, increasing the average amount of the liquidity supply  , and the way in which liquidity is allotted to the banking system, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">it has increased the maturity of its refinancing operations, it has augmented the frequency of its fine-tuning operations, and it has occasionally applied different tender specifications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Box 1 Adjustments to Open Market Operations during the recent turmoil Distribution of liquidity supply The main reason for adjusting the distribution of liquidity supply during the turmoil was the perceived change in the pattern of the demand for liquidity within the maintenance periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.71,0)">The financial turmoil showed that interest rates were no longer necessarily linked to liquidity conditions on the last day of the maintenance period, as banks did no longer regard reserve holdings on different days of the maintenance period to be substitutes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Indeed, in the first days of the turmoil, interest rates rose significantly because they were driven mainly by precautionary motives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.49,0)">Counterparties were not only reluctant to lend on unsecured terms, but they also feared being confronted with unexpected liquidity needs and, as a consequence, preferred having liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.21,0)">Therefore, to avoid upward pressure to overnight rates, the supply of liquidity had to be brought forward within the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As a result, the ECB accommodated banks’ preference for front-loading their reserves during the reserve maintenance period, by increasing the liquidity supply at the beginning of the period and reducing it later in the period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">More specifically, since the start of the turmoil and after the first “fire-fighting” fine-tuning operations conducted in August, the ECB has achieved this frontloading by adjusting its regular provision of liquidity in the regular main refinancing operations so as to provide larger amounts at the beginning of the maintenance periods, while it has provided correspondingly less towards the end of the maintenance period, so that in total, over an entire maintenance period, the supply of liquidity has remained unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.52,0)">In addition, since November, whenever notable downward pressure on the overnight rate started to appear, it has also conducted liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operations with maturities of between two and five days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Through this policy of front-loading, the ECB has allowed credit institutions to fulfil their reserve requirements relatively early in the maintenance period, but, at the same time, it has kept unchanged its average supply of liquidity over the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Such an approach is in line with the Eurosystem’s aim to provide to the banking system, over each maintenance period, the exact amount of liquidity needed to fulfil their liquidity deficit, which is given by the reserves requirements and the net liquidity-absorbing autonomous factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Adjustment in the allotment of liquidity over the reserve maintenance period In order to support a normalisation of the conditions of the money market, the ECB has adjusted the way in which the liquidity is allotted to the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">This has been achieved though several actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, as just mentioned, the ECB has made more frequent use of fine-tuning operations than in “normal” times   and to absorb excess liquidity), as needed in order to keep the very short term interest rates close to the minimum bid rate in the light of the highly unstable and unpredictable liquidity demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Second, the Eurosystem has increased the share of refinancing provided via three-month longer-term refinancing operations  , and reduced the share provided via the one-week MROs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Accordingly, the total amount of outstanding refinancing has remained unchanged, while the average maturity has been extended, thereby contributing to reduce the future liquidity needs of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">- More specifically, in addition to the regular monthly LTROs, two supplementary LTROs with a maturity of three months were carried out in August and September 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Governing Council decided to renew these operations, with slightly amended sizes, when they matured in late 2007 and in early 2008, and has since announced the renewal of the upcoming maturities in May and June 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">- Besides, on 28 March 2008 the Eurosystem decided to further enhance the provision of supplementary longer term refinancing, and announced two supplementary six-month LTRO of a pre-set amount of EUR 25 billion, to be settled in April and July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">As a result, the share of the total refinancing provided through LTROs is currently 66%, more than double the share   prior to the financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Third, a special tender procedure with full allotment has been applied on two occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">- Such procedure was first applied for the fine-tuning operation on 9 August, when it was deemed more efficient to leave it to the market to determine the exact allotment amount, given the large degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">- A more muted variant of a fixed rate tender with full allotment was applied in the MRO on 18 December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">This operation had an exceptionally prolonged maturity of two weeks so that banks could cover their liquidity needs over Christmas and the days around the year-end in advance of this difficult period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This muted variant consisted of pre-announcing a commitment on the ECB’s side to satisfy all bids at or above the weighted average rate of the previous MRO  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">As a result, the ECB allotted €348.6 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.79,0)">Large amounts of this significant additional liquidity were subsequently absorbed via several fine-tuning operations, mostly with an overnight maturity, to avoid an excessive downward pressure on the overnight rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">This measure significantly reversed the increasing trend in the Euribor/OIS spread and the EONIA remained somewhat below the minimum bid rate, reflecting banks’ comfortable liquidity positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Evidence in support of the martingale hypothesis in normal times is presented in Cassola, N.  , The reserve fulfilment path of euro area commercial banks: Empirical testing using panel data, ECB Working Paper 869.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Second , in the context of coordinated central banks’ actions, the ECB has agreed with the Federal Reserve System to grant loans in US dollars to euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s loans have been financed through a currency arrangement   between the FED and the ECB in connection with the FED’s Term Auction Facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Box 2 Operations in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility In order to address the concerns of euro area banks on the availability of their funding denominated in US dollars, the ECB agreed with the Federal Reserve System a currency arrangement   in connection with their US dollar Term Auction Facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The Eurosystem provided the US dollar funding received via this swap line to its counterparties with access to the marginal lending facility, against collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit operations  , in two operations settling on 20 and 27 December 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">These operations were renewed on 17 and 31 January 2008 and again on 25 March and 7 April 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">The USD liquidity-providing operations did not have an effect on the supply of euro liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Similar operations were also carried out by the Swiss National Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At each of the first four operations, the volumes of US dollar loans provided with a maturity of one month totalled USD 10 billion, while at the last two operations, US dollar loans for a total of USD 15 billion were offered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.86,0)">The operations were conducted at a fixed rate equal to the marginal rate of the simultaneous Federal Reserve tenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">Boxes 1 and 2 explain in greater detail these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Let me underscore that, in fact, they are all only rather minor adjustments to the existing operational framework for monetary policy implementation, which, has so far, proved to be sufficiently flexible to cope with the recent tensions in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, throughout the period of financial market turmoil, the ECB has promptly communicated to the market its liquidity policy orientation and explained its actions via press releases, statements on newswire services and other communications channels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">These communication efforts have supported the monetary policy implementation operations by reassuring the market on the readiness of the ECB to take adequate measures when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Eurosystem’s collateral framework The ability of the Eurosystem to respond to the challenges for monetary policy implementation posed by the recent period of financial market volatility, that represents its most difficult test from the start of Stage Three of Monetary Union in 1999, has to a large extent depended on its collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Indeed, the collateral framework is considered to have played an important role in supporting the functioning of the money market and effectively addressing the asset refinancing needs of counterparties, without requiring ad-hoc changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In order to understand the role of the collateral framework in the current turmoil, let me recall a key principle of the Eurosystem’s operational framework stating that all credit operations need to be based on adequate collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The concept of “adequacy” implies, first, by statute that the Eurosystem should be protected from incurring losses in its credit operations and, second, as a policy consideration that sufficient collateral should be available to a wide set of counterparties, so that the ability of the Eurosystem to provide the amount of liquidity it deems necessary for both its monetary policy and payment systems operations should not be impeded by a shortage of collateral in the banking sector as a whole, or even in a significant part of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To ensure that this is not the case, the Eurosystem accepts a broad range of debt instruments as collateral, ranging from government bonds, bonds issued by supranational institutions, covered and uncovered bank bonds, corporate bonds and ABSs to non-marketable instruments, such as credit claims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This wide list of eligible assets - together with the sizeable number of counterparties and the large size of its refinancing operations - has helped the Eurosystem to implement its liquidity management policies during the recent period of decline in market and funding liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">More specifically, by allowing the refinancing of ABSs on a large scale at rates close to ECB policy rates, the collateral framework may have also contributed to financial stability, at least in the short term, by avoiding forced sales of ABSs, which would have intensified the liquidity crisis in the market for these securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Two significant developments have been observed during the turmoil with respect to the Eurosystem collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The total amount of collateral held with the Eurosystem by counterparties has increased significantly, the main reason being that banks have increased their collateral buffer, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.0,0)">the amount of collateral held with the Eurosystem in excess of the quantity needed for monetary policy operations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This amount has increased from around EUR 600 billions in the first half of 2007 to around EUR 800 billions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The increase in over-collateralization during the turmoil might reflect a natural preference of banks to expand their liquidity buffers – in order to get maximum access to intraday liquidity and to the marginal lending facility in case of need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.02,0)">In addition to this, banks have had to collateralise temporarily higher amounts of outstanding Eurosystem credit because of the frontloading policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Finally, regulatory incentives might have played a role, as regulators may have allowed banks to apply better liquidity ratios to assets held with the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.58,0)">Despite the significant rise in aggregate collateral held with the Eurosystem, there are no developments indicating a shortage of eligible collateral among banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The share of asset-backed securities in the total collateral held with the Eurosystem has risen to more than one-fifth in December 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.81,0)">As liquidity in ABSs primary and secondary markets   has dried out almost completely during the turmoil, counterparties have intensified the use of ABSs as collateral with central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">It should however be noted that assets held as collateral with the Eurosystem are not refinanced on a one-to-one basis, given the high degree of over-collateralization of the Eurosystem’s credit operations that I have mentioned above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Actions of other central banks As regards other central banks, in general their primary response to the market turmoil has been to intervene to keep short-term money market rates near target rates, through more active liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Moreover, central banks have aimed to ease the increasing pressure in term money markets by:   increasing the viability of standing loan facilities as backstop funding options;   boosting the share of longer-term operations in total refinancing provided to banks; and   expanding the range of acceptable collateral and eligible counterparties, in those countries where it was needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Central banks have also gradually increased their mutual cooperation, initially through enhanced communication and collective monitoring of market developments, and later on by undertaking coordinated actions to provide funds over the year-end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These actions have included the establishment of the earlier-mentioned foreign exchange swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.81,0)">Box 3 Operations by other central banks More in detail, the actions undertaken by other central banks in response to the market turmoil have included the following: In order to steer short-term market rates, central banks have conducted operations that were either outside their regular schedule or provided amounts larger than usual, and have taken further steps to equilibrate demand and supply for central bank reserves at the policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">- The Federal Reserve on 17 August 2007 enhanced the attractiveness of the central bank’s standing loan facility by cutting the spread between the interest rate on its lending facility   and the federal funds rate target to 50 basis points  , and by increasing the allowable term on loans from overnight to 30 days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">On 16 March 2008, the spread between the discount rate and the Fed funds target rate was further reduced to 25 basis points and a new facility for primary dealers was introduced  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This facility, which is very similar to the discount window for depository institutions, has been heavily used from the beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">- The Bank of England increased target ranges for the maintenance period from the normal ± 1% up to ± 60%, thereby greatly increasing flexibility of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Central banks have also sought to address continued pressures in term markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">- The Federal Reserve has provided longer-term financing   to primary dealers and introduced a Term Auction Facility   for depository institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The Swiss National Bank carried out its first ever three-month repurchase transaction on 13 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Bank of England, offered in September and October 2007 a sequence of additional longer-term refinancing auctions, which, in March 2008, were rolled over, with their size further increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Moreover, at the end of 2007 many central banks anticipated or expanded the provision of term funds that spanned into 2008 in order to ease year-end pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Another important development has the enlargement of the range of eligible collateral by several central banks, temporarily or permanently, and of the list of eligible counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">- The new Term Auction Facility   introduced by the Fed extended the broad range of discount window collateral to a series of substantial longer-term refinancing operations structured as loans against pools of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">- The Bank of England broadened its relatively narrow range of collateral for its additional longer term operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">- The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also widened the list of collateral eligible for   their operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">On 11 March 2008, the Fed introduced a new Term Securities Lending Facility under which market participants can swap, for periods of 28 days, certain securities with currently limited market liquidity   into highly liquid Treasury securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This facility allows counterparties to mobilise certain types of collateral, without however having a direct impact on the Fed’s liquidity management, as the Fed provides Treasury securities rather than cash in return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Preliminary lessons of the turmoil and ongoing initiatives 5.1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Lessons from an operational framework point of view Since its inception the operational framework of the Eurosystem, which I have described earlier on, has been tested on several occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">One such occasion was the management of the cash changeover in early 2002; another test of the resilience of the framework came after the terrorist attacks in September 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.59,0)">The present market turmoil however has posed new challenges to the framework, and in many aspects even more significant than those faced in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I would like to stress that the ECB, with its regular set of tools, has been able to stabilise short-term money market rates reasonably well during the ongoing turmoil, which is a testimony to its flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Several features of the framework have been – and continue to be – important in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In normal times, the regularity and predictability of operations   is useful in order to stabilise money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Indeed, with the benefit of several years of experience, the Eurosystem and its counterparties have learned to interpret and predict each other’s actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This has led to stable behaviour in banks’ participation in the ECB’s operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">During the recent stress, some other features have proved to be very useful, including in particular the wide range of eligible collateral, the large number of counterparties and probably also the relatively large size of refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Let me briefly recall the specific way in which the different features of the framework have proved to be important in the recent turmoil period: First of all, the flexibility of the operational framework has proven to be extremely valuable, because it has allowed the ECB to adjust its liquidity supply at any time in line with the changing demand for central bank balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this regard, let me stress one particularly important feature of the framework, namely the strict separation of actions related to liquidity policy from the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.06,0)">The technical measures that have been employed over recent months have – contrary to widespread belief – not had an impact on the overall liquidity provision, defined as the banking sector’s current account holdings with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This is because all the additional liquidity provided has subsequently been compensated for by means of the provision of less liquidity later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.55,0)">What has changed has simply been the timing of the provision of liquidity to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It is important to stress this – particularly at the moment, with risks to price stability clearly on the upside – in order to avoid any misunderstanding regarding links between liquidity policy and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The second feature of the framework that has proved to be very useful has been the large number of counterparties in the ECB’s operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB has been able to reach a large number of banks in its open market operations at a time when the money market has been working imperfectly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">As a result, the Eurosystem has continued to be able to influence short-term money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Third , several features of the collateral framework have been important, notably the wide range of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">First of all, this has, together with the relatively large size of the Eurosystem’s refinancing operations, allowed those banks which faced reduced access to the interbank market, to raise liquidity via the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Moreover, the wide range of eligible collateral has made it possible for banks   to economise on those few assets, such as government bonds, that have continued to be tradable throughout the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In this respect, the framework has supported the continued functioning of capital markets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">At the same time, the single list of collateral, which specifies unambiguously the eligible assets, has facilitated banks’ liquidity management under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This has contributed to the continued smooth conduct of open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.71,0)">However, the continued low marketability of many assets limits their use as collateral in market transactions, and this has had implications for the markets’ willingness to lend and borrow on the money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In this regard, I would hope that capital markets will develop further so that markets are, in the future, better equipped to cope with periods of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.05,0)">In addition, we still observe certain reluctance by banks to use the marginal lending facility for reputational reasons, as if recourse to it signalled the need for emergency assistance from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">We need to continue thinking about how to make sure that the recourse to this type of facilities is unimpeded so that they can be more effectively used for regular liquidity management purposes by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">5.2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">Lessons for liquidity risk management Some observers have argued that liquidity shortages are the symptoms of major failures in liquidity risk management by the financial institutions involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Indeed, there is no doubt that, once the turmoil subsides, important lessons will need to be drawn in practice as regards liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In response to the turmoil, there have been concerted policy deliberations both at the international and EU levels, by the FSF and ECOFIN respectively, with the aim of addressing the weaknesses brought to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Among the main areas of this work, one of the most important aims at enhancing banks’ risk management practices and especially those related to liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Developments at the international level At the international level, the Financial Stability Forum   has put forward a number of short-term actions to rebuild confidence in the creditworthiness and robustness of financial institutions, in order to facilitate the smooth operation of the market in terms of liquidity flow and provision of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this context, supervisors and central banks are viewed as having a role in ensuring the existence of adequate capital and liquidity buffers of supervised institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">However, there is a clear consensus that competent authorities cannot substitute the private sector for the more fundamental need of the market to recover confidence in the ability of the financial system to manage current risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the medium term, considerations for expected policy actions concern topics pertaining to the current regulatory framework and practices as well as market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The former aim to introduce a number of measures that will reinforce the capital and liquidity buffers of banks, enhance risk management practices, and improve competent authorities’ assessments, responsiveness and exchange of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The latter will address issues relating to the attributes of the “originate to distribute” model, the role of credit rating agencies and market transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.63,0)">The international committee addressing liquidity risk   is the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The main current focus of a specific substructure of the BCBS   is the update of the 2000 guidance on “Sound Practices for Managing Liquidity in Banking Organisations”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">This update will review the current practices and strengthen areas identified as warranting additional attention due to the financial market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The update will include further guidance for the supervision of liquidity risk management and will address issues that are pertinent for cross-border banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This updated supervisory guidance is expected to be issued by July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.74,0)">It is also worth to note that in February 2008, the Basel Committee released a report on the management and supervisory challenges related to liquidity risk resulting from the structural changes in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The report reviews different jurisdictions’ approaches to supervising and regulating funding liquidity risk and assesses preliminary lessons and implications arising from the market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.66,0)">Its main findings can be summarised in the following three points: First, the structural changes in the financial markets have given rise to a significant set of challenges in assessing liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In this respect, the establishment of the “originate to distribute” model as well as the growing use of securitisation and market–based funding have increased the funding capacity of institutions at the price of increasing their vulnerability to adverse market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The increased use of securitisation has also engendered contingent liquidity risk, for instance, through liquidity backstop arrangements, early amortisation provisions, or through support of sponsored conduits and off-balance sheet vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.18,0)">Money market instruments, being much more volatile than retail deposits, require a prompt replacement of any loss of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.3,0)">Moreover, these instruments are difficult to price, as they are normally not actively traded and their short track period impinges on the reliability of cash-flow predictions and correlations with other financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Second, the real-time nature of an increasing number of payment and settlement systems has heightened the importance of intraday liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The recent improvements to the design of payment and settlement systems pose increasing challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.83,0)">For instance, eventual failures in time-critical payments and major liquidity shocks can be transmitted from one institution to another, both domestically or internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Moreover, institutions must ensure liquidity to meet their obligations on a timely basis throughout the business day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Finally, financial markets are increasingly integrated, which in combination with the aforementioned structural changes, imply that any event in one market can spread and reverberate more quickly than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.21,0)">On the one hand, liquidity disruptions can move faster across international markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.63,0)">On the other hand, liquidity may not be fully transferable across borders due to rules from national regulators for local operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.87,0)">Thus, institutions need to consider the conditions of overseas markets, as well as the time and restrictions taken to complete the transfer of funds or collateral across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Developments at EU level At the same time, work has been progressing at the EU level in accordance with the ECOFIN mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The two main fora conducting work in this area are the Committee of European Banking Supervisors   and the ECB in cooperation with the Banking Supervision Committee  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The work of CEBS on liquidity risk management is covering the three following areas: First, reviewing technical issues such as collateral management; concentration of liquidity sources; the distinction between banking and trading book; the relation between liquidity funding risk and liquidity market risk; the use of internal methodologies; and the impact of payment and settlement systems design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, investigating the possible differences in the regulatory and supervisory treatment of branches and subsidiaries and clarifying the underlying reasons and objectives that drive the different approaches in relation to the allocation of tasks and responsibilities for these two types of entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Third, assessing the possibility of achieving further convergence by developing high level principles for the use of internal methodologies in the supervision of liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In parallel to the work of the CEBS, the ECB, in cooperation with the BSC, is conducting work aimed to investigate   the typology of EU banks’ liquidity stress-testing techniques and contingency funding plans,   the performance of stress-tests during the turmoil and   the implications of identified shortcomings for counterparties and money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">This strand of work is currently progressing and is expected to be finalised before the end of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Work in the field of liquidity risk already underway before the turmoil Although work on liquidity risk management has recently attracted increased attention, this does not mean that it is a new issue in the supervisory agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.74,0)">Over the past few years concerns have been voiced over the divergence of prudential requirements for liquidity risk and over structural changes in the banking sector, such as the increasing reliance on more market-based and volatile sources of funding that could constitute contagion channels in the event of a stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">As a result, deliberations and further work in the area of liquidity risk management were underway even before the turmoil, with the aim of ensuring that practices by both the industry and the competent authorities kept in pace with the rapid developments in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In this context, CEBS published in August an updated survey of the regulatory frameworks adopted by the Member States and the three EEA countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The survey was conducted in the light of market developments and included specific information regarding any differences in treatment across specific types of credit institutions and/or investment firms The ECB has also been performing extensive work in the field of liquidity risk management, focusing on three main areas, namely: 1) assessing the impact of structural changes in the banking landscape; 2) gauging the extent to which liquidity risk management practices have progressed; and 3) ascertaining the industry’s views about eventual barriers to the efficient management of liquidity risk across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In October, the ECB, in cooperation with the BSC, published a comprehensive report on the organisation of liquidity risk management for cross-border banking groups in the EU, covering various pertinent issues, namely regulation, obstacles to the pooling of liquidity and cross-border use of collateral and recent market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In particular, the report confirmed the trend towards the centralisation of liquidity risk management policies and procedures and de-centralisation of day-to-day liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.25,0)">Against this background, the internal corporate governance and organisation of liquidity risk management varied according to the individual bank’s structure and business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The use of more sophisticated internal liquidity risk approaches such as Liquidity-at-Risk was not common; however, cross-border banks were increasingly developing such approaches for internal risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.93,0)">Coming to the factors affecting the liquidity risk management of cross-border banks, liquidity risk regulation was not considered by the market as imposing undue restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.04,0)">Cross-border banks requested a more concerted approach by their supervisors and cited the home/host arrangements and the large exposures limits as posing possible obstacles to the cross-border management of intra-group liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.65,0)">Certain obstacles regarding the pooling of liquidity and the cross-border use of collateral were also identified, including the divergence in standards of access to central bank money outside the euro area, the non-connectivity of payment and security settlement systems and legal issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In this context, the industry acknowledged the importance of the initiatives taken by central banks to address problems in international flows of liquidity and the cross-border use of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.08,0)">In addition to the aforementioned issues, market developments that also affected liquidity risk management of cross-border banks consisted of the shortening time-horizon for payment obligations, the increased reliance on wholesale and potentially more volatile funding sources as well as the growing need for high-quality collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Let me also mention initiatives by the industry in the field of liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For instance, the Institute of International Finance   published in March 2007 the “Principles of Liquidity Risk Management” consisting of a number of key recommendations and appropriate practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The IIF paper establishes that the needs and strategies of individual institutions can vary for a variety of reasons, suggesting that any liquidity recommendations or guidelines must be seen as describing a “range of good practices” and not necessarily prescribing a single “best” practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Governance and organisational structure are identified as critical in managing liquidity risk, given that no narrowly prescribed approach can be followed, as liquidity issues arise in different ways for institutions with different structures and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Another area of recommendations from the IIF concerns the coordination of supervisor’s efforts, suggesting the harmonisation of regulations where possible in order to foster sound internal risk management systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This would also include – in the view of the IIF – harmonisation of the range of collateral that central banks and settlement systems accept and increased convergence and transparency from central banks in their role as “lender of last resort”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.42,0)">Conclusions While the current turmoil’s ultimate cause are the substantial losses of financial assets linked to the US housing market, liquidity problems have driven its fever curve ever since its outbreak in the summer of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.62,0)">Diminished liquidity in the markets that play a key role in enabling banks to implement their risk management strategies have led to a decline in funding liquidity at individual banks and given rise to adverse liquidity spirals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In response to these tensions, the ECB and other central banks have undertaken a variety of liquidity management operations in order to support the interbank money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.23,0)">However, some observers have argued that market tensions are partly the symptoms of major failures in liquidity risk management by private financial institutions in the past and that, by supporting banks when they get into trouble, central banks may be encouraging moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.92,0)">For instance, Goodhart has warned that “liquidity management has been passed from the commercial banks to the central bank”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There is no question that moral hazard issues need to be taken very seriously into account when central banks decide on measures to support the banking system in a situation of financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Of course, any such support policy, if anticipated, will be taken into account when banks establish their risk management frameworks for “tail” events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.6,0)">Still, one should refrain from generalising and concluding from this observation that central banks should not re-act and support the financial system in the case of severe liquidity disruptions to money and credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.87,0)">In fact, nobody would dispute that the entire economy can be seriously affected if we allow financial market turmoil to develop into a credit crunch or a banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In the context of the current turmoil, the primary objectives of the ECB’s liquidity management policy have been from the beginning clearly identified:   to steer the overnight rate close to its key policy rate so as implement the monetary policy stance determined by the Governing Council; and   to support the proper functioning of the money market as a whole by helping credit institutions to meet their liquidity needs in a smooth manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">By doing so, the ECB has contributed to safeguarding financial stability and supported the effective functioning of the mechanisms through which monetary policy is transmitted in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I am fully confident that, once the current turmoil subsides, we will have learned much about how to render the operational frameworks of central banks even more effective in providing access to liquidity in both normal times and under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At the same time, I think it is legitimate to expect that banks will make substantial progress in addressing the weaknesses in their liquidity risk management practices that the current turmoil has revealed and that, by doing so, they should make it less likely that history will repeat itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">I am very grateful to Samuel Lopes, Philippe Molitor, Romana Peronaci, Valia Rentzou, Ralph Weidenfeller and Alessandro Calza for their valuable inputs and contributions, and to Ulrich Bindseil and Fatima Pires for their useful comments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Banque de France,
