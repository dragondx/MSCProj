    <span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)"> Continuity, consistency and credibility Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the 21st Frankfurt European Banking Congress “The Big Shift”, Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 2011 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a privilege and a pleasure for me to be here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you know, this is the first time I’m speaking publicly as President of the European Central Bank outside the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I could not think of a more appropriate occasion than the European Banking Congress in the ECB’s home town.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I understand that this congress was established about 20 years ago to strengthen the position of Frankfurt as a European financial centre, and thereby make the city attractive as a location – first for the European Monetary Institute and now for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Well, I am pleased to see how successful it has been!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Before discussing the shift towards a much greater role of emerging economies, which is the theme of today’s congress, let me elaborate on the current situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.76,0)">The euro area situation and ECB monetary policy Activity is expected to weaken in most of the advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.71,0)">This is the result of a weakening of various components of aggregate demand, both domestic and foreign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And it is evident in ‘hard’ data as well as survey data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.99,0)">In the euro area, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased, and the weaker degree of activity will moderate price, cost and wage pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.59,0)">This is why the ECB decided to reduce its key interest rates by 25 basis points on 3 November, acting in full compliance with its mandate to maintain price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.79,0)">We are aware of the current difficulties for banks due to the stress on sovereign bonds, the tightness of funding markets and the scarcity of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.98,0)">We are also aware of the problems of maturity mismatches on balance sheets, the challenges to raise levels of capital and the cyclical risks related to the downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the money market, we see rising spreads between secured and unsecured segments, and a widening of repo prices between different types of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.76,0)">Interbank activity remains subdued and concentrated in the very short-term maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This limited activity is reflected in increased recourse to our liquidity-providing operations, as well as to our deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">So far, the ECB has taken several non-standard measures to ensure that short-term funding does not represent a problem for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The most important non-standard measures are the fixed rate full allotment procedures and the longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">We have also implemented three additional US dollar operations, which cover the end of the year, and we have launched a second covered bond purchasing programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me use this occasion to dwell a bit further on monetary policy in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Three principles are of the essence: continuity, consistency and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Continuity first and foremost refers to our primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Consistency means to act in line with our primary objective and with our strategy both in time and over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Credibility implies that our monetary policy is successful in anchoring inflation expectations over the medium and longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This is the major contribution we can make in support of sustainable growth, employment creation and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And we are making this contribution in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.4,0)">Gaining credibility is a long and laborious process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.28,0)">Maintaining it is a permanent challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.65,0)">But losing credibility can happen quickly – and history shows that regaining it has huge economic and social costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">These three principles – continuity, consistency and credibility – are at the root of the Governing Council’s outstanding record during the past 13 years in terms of price stability and anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">National economic policies are equally responsible for restoring and maintaining financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Solid public finances and structural reforms – which lay the basis for competitiveness, sustainable growth and job creation – are two of the essential elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">But in the euro area there is a third essential element for financial stability and that must be rooted in a much more robust economic governance of the union going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the first place now, it implies the urgent implementation of the European Council and Summit decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">We are more than one and a half years after the summit that launched the EFSF as part of a financial support package amounting to 750 billion euros or one trillion dollars; we are four months after the summit that decided to make the full EFSF guarantee volume available; and we are four weeks after the summit that agreed on leveraging of the resources by a factor of up to four or five and that declared the EFSF would be fully operational and that all its tools will be used in an effective way to ensure financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.74,0)">Where is the implementation of these long-standing decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The shift towards a much greater role of emerging economies Let me now turn to the “big shift” in the global economy that is the theme of today’s congress: the much greater role of emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Their performance in the aftermath of the crisis has been impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.78,0)">Diverging economic performance between the emerging economies and the advanced economies had been evident for at least a decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">But after the crisis, there was a dramatic widening in the divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.15,0)">Initially after the ‘Lehman shock’ of September 2008, economic activity contracted sharply in both advanced and emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">But a two-speed recovery quickly became evident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.33,0)">The emerging economies have returned to their pre-crisis economic dynamism very rapidly, while the advanced economies have experienced the slow pace of growth that is typical for recoveries following profound financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.55,0)">To this day, most of the advanced economies are only close to, or have just recovered, their production levels pre-Lehman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In contrast, output in the main emerging economies is now already 20% higher than it was before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.09,0)">In the past, shocks in advanced economies often caused enduring drags on emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.78,0)">The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s was a prominent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">But now, economic reform and strengthened institutions in the emerging world have changed this pattern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Generally, these economies have built enough financial, fiscal and external buffers to dampen international spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.96,0)">The second feature I would like to highlight is the asymmetry between the rising role of the emerging economies in trade and their still lagging role in finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">They are giants in trade, but their financial linkages to the rest of the world are still developing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Indeed, they are much more open in terms of trade: trade openness is close to 60% of GDP, whereas the same measure based on financial flows is less than 15% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The third feature is the relevance of emerging economies for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">They account for roughly one third of our external trade, up from a quarter ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Interestingly, this increase in the weight of emerging economies has improved the price competitiveness of the euro area, because on average they have had higher inflation than us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At the same time, their higher inflation has not fed into higher euro area prices, because their goods were much cheaper to begin with and because of an increasing share of imports from these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The euro area also benefits from trade with emerging economies in terms of product specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">We have a comparative advantage in mid-technology exports, while the most dynamic emerging economies focus on either high-tech or low-tech good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Thus, those economies compete more directly with exports from the United States and Japan or other emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The euro area is also helped by the composition of demand in emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This is tilted more towards goods than services, matching the composition of euro area exports better than that of other large advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Therefore, in macroeconomic terms, the euro area’s trade relationship with emerging economies has been generally positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Conclusion In spite of the decoupling experienced in recent years, the fortunes of advanced and emerging economies are intimately linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The growth of emerging economies has brought a much higher level of economic prosperity to hundreds of millions of their people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">And their rising role means that today they share responsibility for global economic performance in half with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They account for almost 50% of global GDP measured in purchasing power parity terms  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.04,0)">In today’s global economy, advanced economies can face some of the same distress that was earlier associated with emerging economies: profound fiscal challenges, sudden stops in capital flows, macroeconomic retrenchment and forced reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the same time, and going forward, the emerging economies will be confronted with the challenges that have long concerned advanced economies: population ageing and, perhaps, reform fatigue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In spite of the current challenges faced by the global economy, we must resist temptation to resort to unilateral policies, and we must work together to ensure that the gains achieved are firmly secured for future generations.</span>
