    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Third ECB Central Bank conference on ‘The new EU Member States: convergence and stability’ in Frankfurt, 21 and 22 October Concluding remarks Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB22 October 2004 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my honour and pleasure to draw some conclusions at the end of the third ECB Central Banking Conference on “the new Member States: convergence and stability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I hope that you found the last two days inspiring and stimulating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The road from EU enlargement to the euro is indeed a fascinating challenge for policy makers, academics and economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">During these two days we engaged into in-depth discussions about the past, present and future paths of the new Member States joining the European Monetary Union and the challenges that these countries are confronted with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me briefly elaborate on the main arguments and issues that were raised at the Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">I would then also like to take the opportunity to share with you the ECB’s view about the main challenges for the new Member States on their way to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In his presentation, Gerard Roland raised some key institutional and structural questions concerning the enlargement of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">First, how have institutions of the new Member States changed during the last decade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Second, what role has the European Union played during the transition phase and finally how will EU enlargement affect the functioning of the EU-25 in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.81,0)">As expected, institutions matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The idea of the European Union acting as an “external anchor” for most of the new Member States has played a major role and incentives to meet the entry conditions set by the EU have worked well for the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">According to many indicators which Gerard Roland presented yesterday the new Member States’ performances have been good; for example, price and trade liberalisation have been fully adopted, competition policy has been successful and most importantly individuals live in democratic societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">This success can also be seen in how these countries have adopted and implemented the acquis communautaire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.55,0)">Taking stock of the progress made so far the paper stresses that more work still needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Reforms and progress especially in the banking and other financial sectors should be continued to create a solid and sustainable base for the economies of the new Member States, which can also be seen as important requirements for joining the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">I agree with discussants that the new member states will be active and will contribute positively to the functioning of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Jürgen von Hagen’s presentation complements Gerard Roland’s presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">His findings also support the macroeconomic stabilisation achieved by the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">On top of that most of the new Member States have undertaken major reforms to restructure their public sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Spending ratios have fallen remarkably and public sectors operate in a much more efficient manner than previously, but there still seems to be room for improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">A well structured public sector and sound fiscal policy are necessary ingredients for a successful participation in a monetary union today and in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Jürgen von Hagen also commented on the future adoption of the euro and I will shortly touch upon this topic later in my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Doug Laxton and Michael Kumhof’s presentation today dealt with the macroeconomic performance of the new Member States, or more specifically the performance of the Czech Republic, from a different angle than the two other presentations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.2,0)">It is an extremely challenging task to utilise a modern structural Dynamic   General Equilibrium model to study the pros and cons for a country to join EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">I think the authors have done a good job in their brave attempt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Because of the nature of the model, in theory, one is able to get a coherent picture about the costs and benefits of joining EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the analysis the authors concentrate on the trade sector where trade is determined endogenously between the two countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The results from their exercise are intuitive and mostly convincing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">A reduction in trade costs creates a significant long-term increase in trade and most importantly the main winners will be the joining members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The single currency will lower uncertainties and costs of transferring money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Eventually this will lead to welfare gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">I share the view of commentators that the exact values of outcomes are not that important because of the uncertainties involved in numerical exercises utilising macro models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What is important is to show the basic outcomes and most likely scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">I also share the point raised by the commentators that inclusion of analysis of financial integration’s effect on welfare would be beneficial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In his speech, my colleague, Otmar Issing, talked about EU enlargement and monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The adoption of the euro by the New Member states will be the final step in monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">As Otmar mentioned, a sufficient degree of economic and financial integration is necessary for adopting the euro successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Fulfilling the Maastricht criteria is a sign that sustainable convergence has been reached and countries are on the right path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Monetary authorities also play an important role in this process by conducting a credible policy which leads to price stability and thus creating an environment where entering into ERM II will be smooth and credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.99,0)">Most of the results presented here are broadly in line with the ECB’s view that EU enlargement has positive implications for economic growth and welfare in both the “previous” and “new” Member States; unfortunately, these benefits have often been set aside in the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Already the prospect of the countries joining the EU had positive implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">As trade and capital movements have been to a large extent liberalised well before accession, the degree of integration had already reached a significant level between the new and previous Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In fact, at the eve of EU enlargement the euro area directed around 11% of its total exports and imports to the new Member States, an increase of almost 50% in 10 years; the 10 new Member States as a group represent one of the main trading partners of the euro area, exceeding trade with Japan by far   and being only somewhat lower than the European trade with the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Similarly, the share of the EU-15 total foreign direct investments that was orientated towards the new Member States was also around 12% and tripled since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">While these figures are still low compared to the FDI flows directed to the US, they are considerably higher compared to those flowing to Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In addition, the prospect of EU enlargement has significantly sheltered the new Member States from adverse spill-over effects coming from other emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With EU enlargement now in place, economic and financial integration will advance further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">With the extension of the Single Market to the new Member States all remaining barriers to trade and capital flows have been removed by now, thereby supporting further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It is already observable that small and medium-sized enterprises from the EU-15 countries are becoming significantly more active in the new Member States, as the economic and legal environment has become more stable upon accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Let me stress that enlargement has also led to higher competition in the EU and enhanced the scope for economies of scale following the increase in the market size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">By this, productivity will rise, thereby contributing to an increase in the potential growth rate of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.14,0)">It is important to note that also the “previous” 15 Member States will be affected by higher competition in the EU, which could accelerate structural reforms in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In fact, the new Member States seem to be overall rather competitive and have already made large progress in implementing structural reforms in some areas, which in turn is an incentive for the EU-15 to embark actively on their reform agenda, as Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa stressed it yesterday evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As you know, accession to the EU is only the beginning of the process, which ends with the eventual adoption of the euro, given that these countries have no opting-out clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The path towards euro adoption is embedded in a well-defined multilateral institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">To guide the process of joining EMU the Governing Council of the ECB released a comprehensive policy position on relevant exchange rate issues in December 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Given its importance, I would like to speak about the main implications of the various phases of joining EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Upon EU accession and before joining the exchange rate mechanism  , the new Member States are required to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest and pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">With respect to ERM II participation, there are no formal criteria to be met prior to the entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Nevertheless, a successful and smooth participation in the mechanism requires that major policy adjustments – such as sound fiscal policy frameworks and price liberalisation – are undertaken before joining the mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Depending on the monetary and exchange rate strategies in place, ERM II can help orient macroeconomic policies to stability and anchor inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">At the same time, the mechanism allows for a degree of flexibility, if needed, through the wide standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Eventually, the countries are expected to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Their readiness to adopt the euro will be examined on the basis of a deep and precise analysis of their performance with respect to the Maastricht convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This examination will be done in the so-called Convergence Reports, which are regularly prepared by both the European Commission and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As you probably know, the 2004 Convergence Report has been published two days ago, including for the first time the ten new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The process of monetary integration with the euro area is based on a number of general principles, which are defined by the Treaty and other key documents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">One principle is that there is no single trajectory towards the euro that can be identified and recommended to all new Member States at all times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This principle reflects the fact that the new Member States differ substantially with respect to the size and structure of their economies, the present state of their fundamentals, and the monetary and exchange rate regimes that are currently in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The wide diversity across the new Member States implies that the economic situations and strategies of countries will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Against this background, it is natural that ERM II entry and the preferred length of participation in the mechanism will differ across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In fact, three new Member States, namely Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia, joined ERM II with effect from 28 June 2004, while others have not specified a date when they intend to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another key principle is the principle of equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This means that comparable situations and cases will be treated in a comparable manner, both across countries and over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">With respect to the examination of nominal convergence in the ECB Convergence Report 2004, this implies that the same convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty have been applied as was the case in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Thus, no new criteria were added, while the existing criteria were not relaxed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The process of monetary integration with the euro area should be accompanied by overall consistent and stability-oriented economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Moreover, a stable macroeconomic environment and progress in structural and fiscal reforms are also essential to take full advantage of the benefits of EU enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In my view, the most pressing challenges for the new Member States are to maintain price stability and to advance with fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">With respect to price stability, the new Member States will be confronted with the challenge to complete the disinflation process and/or to contain increases in inflation rates in a controlled fashion, without substantial adverse effects on inflation expectations and wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Besides solid macroeconomic policy frameworks and prudent wage policies, progress with structural reforms is conducive to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.73,0)">With respect to fiscal consolidation, it is clear that this is a demanding challenge for most of the new Member States, as they are confronted with competing expenditure demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">And it is the reason why policy-makers have to design and implement a credible consolidation path based on durable and growth-enhancing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.81,0)">Ladies and Gentleman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.02,0)">It is time for me to close the third ECB Central Banking Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">We had very intensive and inspiring discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">While there are still a number of open questions and issues, I am sure that we will all go home with some new thoughts and ideas in our minds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Let me take the opportunity to thank the authors of the papers for their remarkable work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">My thanks also are going to the discussants, chairpersons and participants for their personal contributions, which were enlightening and ensured that this conference was a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Let me also express my deep gratitude to all the staff of the ECB that has been involved in the organisation of the conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Dear friends, I wish you all a safe trip back home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
