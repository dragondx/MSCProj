    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Keynote speech at the conference “Europe and the Euro – A Family Affair” Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the conference organised by Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie and Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände, Berlin, 16 September 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">It is a great pleasure to be part of an event that brings together entrepreneurs and family businesses from across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Such a gathering reflects many of the reasons why Europe established a single currency in the first place – to deepen the integration of our economies by making it easier for firms and households to exchange across national borders; to encourage the small- and medium-sized enterprises that are so important for growth and job creation; and to give citizens across Europe an impetus to work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Reading the resolution that you plan to adopt at this conference, I am very encouraged by the determination that you show to take the euro area forward – and I naturally support your central objectives of promoting sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Today, I would like to share with you some thoughts on how to achieve sustainable growth in the euro area from an ECB perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There are two main components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The first component is stabilising the euro area, as without a stable foundation there can be no growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The second component is strengthening the euro area – by ensuring sustainable economic policies in all member countries, by increasing the competitiveness of our economies and by completing the institutional architecture of economic and monetary union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">My main message is that we have made significant progress on the first step, stabilising the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">But there is still work to do to transform this achievement into higher growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Strengthening the euro area through sustainable policies, higher competitiveness and stronger common institutions is therefore our priority for today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Stabilising the euro area Let me begin by reviewing the measures that have been taken to stabilise the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.58,0)">Last year, the euro area faced difficult circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.45,0)">Fears about extreme events were leading to severe tensions in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.6,0)">Borrowing costs for some governments had risen to very high levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.39,0)">And market sources of financing for banks in some countries were drying up: for example, between April and July 36 billion euro of Spanish bank bonds matured, but no more than half a billion euro could be newly issued during that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.01,0)">These market events were starting to harm the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">Corporates in stressed countries were struggling to issue debt, and bank loans were becoming prohibitively expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">But today, the situation is improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Borrowing costs for most governments have returned to more sustainable levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Funding for banks in countries under stress has improved significantly, even if this has not yet been fully reflected in the cost of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">And measures of systemic risks have dropped to pre-2011 levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.03,0)">Why has this happened?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The role of governments The first reason is that governments are addressing their fiscal policy challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.87,0)">Thanks to their consolidation efforts so far, the primary fiscal deficit for the euro area has fallen from 3.5% of GDP in 2009 to around 0.5% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This is projected to turn into a primary surplus from 2014 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This improvement in public finances has helped send a signal to investors that government debt levels will stabilise and then fall in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This has been crucial in reassuring markets about debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">But the average public debt level in the euro area is still very high, at around 95% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This means that consolidation efforts need to be maintained in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The role of the ECB The second reason for the improvement in markets is actions by the ECB, notably through the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Our measures have countered investors’ fears about the future of the euro area that emerged last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">As such, they have helped restore the normal functioning of markets, and removed the uncertainty that was paralysing the economies of some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The impact of the OMT announcement has naturally been largest in countries where the uncertainty was greatest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.03,0)">But its effects have been felt across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Capital has started flowing back from the core to the periphery, unwinding some of the distortions in interest rates we saw last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In Germany, for example, long-term interest rates have risen significantly, despite the ECB cutting rates in that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.18,0)">Target2 balances have fallen by around 30% from their peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.47,0)">More generally, the risk of an extreme event in the euro area has fallen – and therefore the risk of an adverse impact on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.07,0)">This threat to euro area price stability was the reason we had to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We had to preserve our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">But I am encouraged that throughout this period, inflation expectations remained firmly anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This shows that markets and citizens trust the ECB to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Strengthening the euro area This improved situation in financial markets, however, has not yet translated into a broad-based economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Let me turn therefore from stabilising the euro area to the measures that are needed to strengthen it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It is welcome news that the euro area recorded 0.3% GDP growth in the second quarter, after six straight quarters of negative growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But the recovery is only in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.71,0)">The economy remains fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.36,0)">And unemployment is still far too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.51,0)">Given the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, the ECB’s Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">So what can we do collectively to raise growth and employment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">As I mentioned, in my view there are three key elements: sustainable policies, higher competitiveness and a more complete EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The first element is sustainable policies because this is a prerequisite for the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Only if there are sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies in all countries can firms prosper and compete effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">And only if all countries can maintain a sustainable position can there be closer euro area integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">EMU was not set up for some members to be permanent creditors and others to be permanent debtors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Why competitiveness matters With this basis in place, the second element is to improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This can be broadly defined as the ability of firms to remain profitable in an open market economy, and to sustain or expand market share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Competitiveness can be measured in a number of ways, but its essence is a comparison of relative costs and relative productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Within the euro area, as countries share an exchange rate, a key measure of competitiveness is the relative cost in particular of labour compared with relative productivity – in other words, unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.87,0)">In the first decade of monetary union a focus on unit labour costs and their implications for competitiveness was largely missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.82,0)">This was based on the false presumption that current accounts did not matter in a single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.82,0)">As a result, competitiveness imbalances emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.41,0)">We saw wages and productivity diverging in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.81,0)">For some of them a significant competitiveness gap and large current account deficits emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.49,0)">Why does this matter?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.72,0)">It is not only because persistent current account deficits create vulnerabilities, such as a dependence on external financing and an over-indebted banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">It is because, since 2008, countries that are more competitive have on average seen higher business margins, lower public debt levels, higher growth, and higher employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This correlation suggests that closing the competitiveness gap is a key component of improving the current economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Closing the competitiveness gap One way to regain competitiveness quickly is to address the numerator in unit labour costs – nominal wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Another, longer-term approach is to increase the denominator – to achieve higher productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In my view, in the euro area today we need both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">On the first count, there are already some encouraging signs of rebalancing in the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Thanks in part to the structural reforms introduced in several countries, relative costs are adjusting where they had become misaligned in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">For example, Spanish export volumes grew by more than 20% since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over time, rising mark-ups should allow Spanish firms to expand capacity and increase hiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But let me be clear here that I do not see competitiveness as a race between euro area countries with winners and losers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">That is why the longer-term challenge of raising productivity is also key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">While cost adjustments increase competitiveness only relatively, productivity gains, by increasing trend growth, can be absolute and benefit all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">So how do we raise productivity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my view the key issue is the connection between three “I’s”: innovation, investment and incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As innovation and investment mostly take place within the private sector, most interesting from a policy perspective are incentives – namely, the role that government can play in encouraging these other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Take investment as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.33,0)">Total investment in the euro area is currently 17% lower than in 2007, while in Germany and France, it is still 2% and 6% below 2007 levels, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Certainly, this derives in part from macroeconomic uncertainty, and in some countries from spare capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">But there is also a strong microeconomic dimension linked to incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.14,0)">In many jurisdictions, some regulations deter private investment and hinder cross-border projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This makes a strong case for fully completing the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">More generally, firms’ incentive to invest is linked to their optimism in the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.24,0)">This is affected by issues such as the burden of administrative procedures, or the speed and quality of the judicial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">These are areas where governments, through reforms, are in a position to make a difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Measuring progress in these areas is not straightforward, but in one indicator that measures the overall business environment, the euro area is currently ranked 26th in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This suggests that several countries could make improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">But it is notable that in this same indicator Germany has risen from 6th to 4th place in the last year, while achieving full employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This underscores once again that competitiveness creates jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The need to strengthen the institutional architecture of EMU Let me turn to the third key element in our collective efforts to strengthen the euro area – and that is to build a stronger architecture for EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">There are several areas in which we can make progress, as we outlined in last year’s “Four Presidents’ Report”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For now, I see the priorities as banking union and economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Banking union serves a range of aims, but in the current circumstances restarting lending to the real economy is the key priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.66,0)">One barrier to bank lending at present is lack of transparency over bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Having a single European supervisor will help address this, as we plan to conduct a comprehensive balance sheet assessment of banks we directly supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.88,0)">Another barrier to bank lending is low investor confidence, which is in part created by different rules for banks across jurisdictions and a lack of comparability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The future European supervisor will also help here, not least by leading to harmonised treatment across the banks it supervises – for example, of loan classification, forbearance and provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Beyond that, banking union should help speed up the repair of banks – that is if, as I hope, we end up with a strong single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We need a mechanism that allows non-viable banks to be wound down without financial stability risks, as we see in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This tends to support a quicker recovery from banking crises and more stable credit provision to firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Economic union is also intended to help the real economy, as it aims to help countries reorient their economic policies to benefit more from sharing a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">We need to ensure that countries can maintain sustainable growth and high levels of employment without developing internal and external imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This is a prerequisite for the stability of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">One way to achieve this would be to develop better ways of measuring economic performance – for example, more structural indicators of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Another possibility would be to encourage structural reforms that make economies function more efficiently, and in a way that is more inclusive and benefits all groups in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Here an idea currently being contemplated is so-called “reform contracts”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Such concepts are still at a relatively early stage, and I look forward to them being developed further in the next few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">As I have explained, the euro area has taken important steps to restore stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">But we now need to build on those foundations to create higher growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The good news is that we understand the challenges we face: to strengthen EMU; to ensure sustainable policies; to improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And to meet these challenges, we can look to several countries for examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But the key is to persevere on the path of reform – and to take inspiration from others that are succeeding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Within the euro area, we all benefit from each other’s prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">I hope that the range of businesses from across the euro area here today will join me in spreading this message.</span>
