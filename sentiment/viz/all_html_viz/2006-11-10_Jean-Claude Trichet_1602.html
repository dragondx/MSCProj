    <span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)"> Panel Intervention at the 4th ECB Central Banking Conference on “The role of money: Money and monetary policy in the 21st century” Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 10 November 2006 Your first question was whether monetary analysis has helped us to anchor inflation expectations in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">As I have stressed on previous occasions,  I am convinced that a thorough monitoring of monetary developments is important for the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">On the empirical side, there is ample evidence that there is a strong long-run link between money growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This has recently been re-emphasised in the academic literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.76,0)">On the theoretical side, Professor Woodford very eloquently told us yesterday  that money does not play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy in standard modern-style macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And I have particularly appreciated his elegant and nuanced exposition of the present intellectual debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I have noted also that Professor Christiano has pointed out in his convincing presentation that, when such models are extended in a realistic way, also good theoretical arguments in support of a clear commitment to take monetary developments into account in the conduct of monetary policy emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This is because it directly helps to stabilise long-term inflation expectations, and as Lucas also pointed out yesterday, because it can help to mitigate the effects of boom-bust cycles in asset markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In fact, the ability of monetary developments to indicate imbalances in the financial system and the implied potential risks to long-run price stability has recently been stressed in particular by the BIS  and is confirmed by recent research at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The money pillar of our monetary policy strategy constitutes a visible commitment to take the long-run link between monetary developments and inflation into account in monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">From my experience I can tell you that this has indeed played an important role in our success in anchoring inflation expectations in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">At the time of the transition to EMU, giving money an important role in our strategy ensured continuity with the most credible central banks joining the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">I am convinced that the monetary pillar was crucial to stabilising inflation expectations in the euro area at the low level prevailing in the countries with the most stable currencies at that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Given the historical dimension of the launch of the euro and the great number of watchers and academics, not to speak of market participants, who were very sceptical, to say the least, about EMU, it is surprising to me that the successful transition to the euro has received so little attention from academic researchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Stressing the importance of the monetary pillar at the time of the introduction of the euro must not be interpreted as suggesting that, now that the ECB has matured, we do not need it any more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">In fact, in helping us to take good and timely policy decisions, the monetary analysis has played an important role in our success in fully preserving the achieved anchoring of inflation expectations over the last eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This in turn has contributed to low macroeconomic volatility in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.09,0)">When inflation expectations are well anchored, temporary deviations of inflation from levels consistent with the central bank’s inflation objective are not expected to be long-lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">As a consequence, macroeconomic shocks will have a smaller impact on inflation expectations and the evolution of inflation over time will be less persistent, with the result that inflation and economic activity will be more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">It is certainly true that other central banks which put less emphasis on monetary analysis have also achieved low and stable inflation expectations and low macroeconomic volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, it is important to bear in mind that the uncertainty faced by the ECB has been much higher than that faced by other more established central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Our success in maintaining low and stable inflation expectations in a rather adverse macroeconomic environment is also due to the commitment to be continuously alert upon monetary trends built into our strategy by the money pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.81,0)">This brings me to the second question, on the criticism that our policy actions have not corresponded to the announced role of money in our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.6,0)">I know that this objection is sometimes put forward by critical observers who argue that there is no direct correlation between our policy rate decisions and monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.86,0)">This kind of criticism does not discomfort me, because the relevance of the monetary pillar can anyway not be judged based on the simple bivariate correlation of policy rates with the growth rate of headline M3  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.58,0)">First, such a simplistic approach cannot reflect the crucial role of cross-checking the information derived from the economic and the monetary analyses that is a key feature of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.28,0)">Second, it overlooks the broad-based and by no means mechanical character of the ECB’s approach to monetary analysis, which Jürgen has also stressed yesterday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Allow me to elaborate on the second point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.04,0)">Monetary data are contaminated by noise at higher frequencies blurring the signal from their low-frequency movements which provide information about medium to longer-run inflation trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary analysis aims to extract this low-frequency signal by assessing a large range of monetary indicators based on statistical tools and judgement in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">Since the signal extracted from the monetary analysis refers to the low frequency it will not change much from month to month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.53,0)">As a consequence, it will, by its very nature, normally not be closely correlated with individual policy moves, but will rather influence the medium-term direction of policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As Otmar has explained this morning,  money can be seen as a kind of anchor for the longer-term direction of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">As I mentioned before, the monetary analysis has played an important role in our success in anchoring inflation expectations and containing macroeconomic volatility in the euro area by helping us to take good and timely policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is generally very difficult to disentangle the respective contribution of the two pillars of our strategy to monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Nevertheless, let me give you three examples where I felt that the monetary analysis had a particularly decisive influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.83,0)">The first goes back to the period from late 2002 up to June 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.64,0)">At that time, some commentators were concerned that the euro area might be heading for deflation and called for a more aggressive loosening of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Our decision not to follow these calls was also due to the observation that the underlying monetary expansion was fairly sustained and therefore clearly ruled out any deflationary pressures over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The monetary analysis therefore played an important role at that time, preventing us from lowering interest rates more aggressively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, we know that this decision was right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">My second example refers to the long period during which we maintained rates at the level of 2%, from July 2003 up to December 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A period, by the way, during which we had made no pre-commitment to maintain rates at this historically low level during a “considerable period of time”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">On the contrary, the Governing Council had made it crystal clear that we could change rates at any time during 2004 and 2005  and the markets had pretty well understood that posture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">My understanding of our decision-making during this period was that it was sometimes a very close call as regards the balance of risks to price stability stemming from the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.41,0)">We experienced two periods, around the turn of 2003/2004 and around mid 2005 – before the slight recovery of early 2004 was perceived and when it became clear that this start of recovery had aborted – where the balance of risks to price stability from the economic analysis was starting in our minds to slightly tilt on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On behalf of the Governing Council I made clear during these two periods, in the questions and answers of the press conferences, that all our options were open, including a decrease of rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.01,0)">If this option did not materialise, it was in my understanding because the monetary analysis was not only not confirming the downward risks to price stability suggested by the economic analysis but was tilting in the other direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">We maintained rates at the level of 2% and again, with the benefit of hindsight, that decision seems to me clearly vindicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">My third example refers to the recent sequence of policy rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.49,0)">In December 2005, when we first increased policy rates, many commentators judged our move premature against the background of a seemingly fragile economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In fact, at that time the signals coming from the economic analysis were not yet so strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">But the continued expansion of money and credit through the course of 2005 gave an intensifying indication of increasing risks to medium- to longer-term price stability which played fully their role in our decision to start increasing policy rates in late 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In retrospect, the strength of the economic recovery unfolding in the course of 2006 has also shown that our decision was well timed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.75,0)">Without our thorough monetary analysis, we could have been in danger of falling behind the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.18,0)">Your last question referred to the communication challenges related to monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">We have consistently communicated the results of our monetary analysis and any uncertainty surrounding it to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The conference paper by Fischer, Lenza, Pill and Reichlin helps in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.71,0)">After all, a central bank that is not successful in explaining the principles guiding its monetary policy decisions will not be able to preserve its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">To me, the success of our policy and the high predictability of our policy decisions  suggest that we have probably been able to communicate our monetary policy strategy and, within that strategy, the role of the monetary analysis in a reasonably efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">And this conference bears testimony to our will to continue being as transparent as possible.</span>
