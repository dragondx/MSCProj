    <span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)"> Structural reforms in the euro area Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB conference “Structural reforms in the euro area”, Frankfurt am Main, 18 October 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you all to this conference on structural reforms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.19,0)">As you know, “structural reforms” has become something of a contested term in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">For many, it describes a pragmatic policy agenda to raise long-term growth and accelerate adjustment to shocks, which is essential for countries in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But for others, the term is viewed as a “catch-all” for a wide range of policies, some of which have potentially negative short-run costs and adverse distributional effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In view of these discussions, it is important to assess – first – whether countries with more flexible structures and more resilient institutions do indeed recover more quickly from shocks and grow faster over the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, we should evaluate how the design of reforms and the overall policy mix affect the impact of structural policies, especially during a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And third, we should assess the distributional effects of reforms, and consider how we can ensure that they benefit everyone in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These are the themes I will focus on in my remarks this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Economic structures, adjustment to shocks and long-term growth First of all, the crisis has helped us better understand a key question for the euro area: are economies that are more flexible also more resilient to adverse shocks, and do they experience faster recoveries and higher long-term growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">By and large, the experience of the crisis has shown the answer to be “yes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">What we have seen is that more economic flexibility and sound institutions do lead to more resilience and higher long-term growth, including when countries face a common shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Indeed, euro area economies that were more flexible at the start of the crisis – as measured by the World Bank Doing Business Indicator in 2009 – subsequently showed a stronger recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">GDP per capita rebounded faster and unemployment fell more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">And looking at the last 15 to 20 years – so over the full cycle – euro area countries with sound economic structures at the outset have shown much higher long-term real growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Confirming this relationship, countries that reformed their product and labour markets during the crisis have also seen good results afterwards – and the full effects are still materialising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Focusing just on the labour market, a number of countries have implemented reforms in recent years which have helped to reduce unemployment – most visibly Spain and Portugal, but also Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">These reforms also seem to have made unemployment more responsive to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Structural policies are a main factor explaining these positive developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">But of course supportive financial and macroeconomic policies have been vital, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">New research also finds that labour market reforms in the euro area reduce the dispersion of unemployment and GDP across member countries following a common shock, making the single monetary policy more effective for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">But it is clear that, to get the best results, there has to be some broad coordination among countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Labour market reforms can emphasise more wage adjustment or more employment adjustment, and countries will only converge in their response to shocks if they have a broadly similar mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This underscores why the European Semester process is crucial – not only for encouraging structural reforms, but also for ensuring some degree of beneficial consistency between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Lessons on the composition of reforms and their interaction with macro policies Still, even if some countries have had positive experiences with reforms during the crisis, we know that for others it has been more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This brings me to my second theme about the design and implementation of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There are three key areas where lessons can be drawn: the packaging of reforms, their scope and the macro-policy mix that accompanies them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">First, the packaging of reforms is crucial for reducing their short-term adjustment costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Unlike what happened in the years even before the crisis, labour market reforms must be preceded – or least accompanied by – product market reforms, otherwise wage adjustments will not be fully passed on to prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.27,0)">Instead, profit mark-ups will rise and the purchasing power of households will fall, thereby worsening the economic conditions of consumers and aggravating any recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.16,0)">During the crisis, because of powerful vested interests, labour market reforms were not accompanied by product market reforms in some countries, and so wages fell and prices did not adjust in tandem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The key question is then: how do we make sure that product market reforms do indeed take place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">While there are no easy answers, IMF research suggests a central part of the answer may be carefully designed fiscal incentives to soften the blow for those affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In the past, Germany, Ireland and the UK have all successfully used such incentives to bring about these reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The second area where we have learned lessons from the crisis is the scope of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.97,0)">Much of the focus in the reform debate has been on product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But what is often forgotten is the scope for progress by reforming public administration and the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">These reforms are effective at all points of the cycle, since they entail very few short-term costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In fact, lessening the time it takes to open a business, or speeding up judicial processes, should yield immediate net gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">And institutional reforms also act as a multiplier for other reform efforts by improving the implementation and enforcement of those measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In light of this, many countries have successfully introduced more broad-based reforms during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But there are still large gains that could be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Published research and internal Eurosystem simulations show that improved economic structures and institutions could result in significantly higher GDP in the long run, depending on the specific reforms and approach used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It has also been estimated that sound economic structures could reduce the probability of a severe recession by around 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The final area where we have learned about reform strategy is the overall policy mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The crisis has lent weight to the view that a supportive macro-policy mix leads to improved reform implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The IMF finds that, where countries have fiscal space, temporary public spending can ease the transitional costs of some reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This is then paid for in the medium term when the growth benefits of those reforms kick in and fiscal positions improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Fiscal incentives have also been shown to improve the effectiveness of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The Italian “Jobs Act” in 2015, for example, has been followed by an increase of almost half a million in the number of people employed with a permanent job contract, in large part because hiring subsidies encouraged firms to take on more people under the new open-ended contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.98,0)">Perhaps more controversial in recent years has been the question of the interaction between monetary policy and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.34,0)">It is often said that monetary policy discourages reforms by taking the pressure off governments to act during crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">But ECB research finds no convincing evidence that high interest rates lead to more reforms, if one controls for the business cycle and other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">In fact, the opposite is more likely to be true: lower rates tend to promote reforms, since they lead to a better macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This is especially useful for countries without the fiscal space to support demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The challenge of pairing reforms with inclusiveness But we have also learned something else from the crisis: highlighting the benefits of reforms in terms of growth is not enough to make them widely acceptable to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">We also need to take into account the inclusiveness of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.9,0)">As we all know, there is an increasing perception that growth in the past has not been sufficiently inclusive, and was not always associated with rising living standards for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.16,0)">This has fuelled the belief that some have been “left behind” by the spread of market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In this context, the case for structural reforms needs to go beyond their efficiency benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">We need to show that reforms can contribute to both efficiency and equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">One way this can be achieved is by focusing more on reforms with positive distributional effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Tackling rent-seeking in some product markets tends to benefit those at the lower end of the income scale, since such reforms lead to lower prices and increased consumption choices, and therefore improve the welfare and purchasing power of poorer people in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Addressing tax avoidance and evasion would also help reduce inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Indeed, the payoff of efforts in this area can be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.53,0)">In 2015, EU countries lost around 12% of total expected revenues in value-added tax, partly because of tax evasion and inadequate tax collection systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.14,0)">Still, some reforms will always have negative distributional effects, at least in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">But in these cases we can do more to reduce inequality by ensuring that flexibility is combined with security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Inclusive labour markets are ones with well-functioning active labour market policies that allow people to reskill, and proactive macroeconomic policies that shorten job transitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Before the crisis, several countries introduced labour market reforms to increase flexibility, but did little to make their labour markets more secure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.1,0)">This ended up disproportionately penalising young people, who had weak job protections and meagre support during unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.55,0)">As I said in a recent speech in Ireland, young people do not want to live on subsidies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">So we should never think that simply compensating the “losers” of reforms is enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Public policies have to be designed to help people back into work, and into jobs where they can develop and refine their skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Given the ongoing polarisation of skills in labour markets, this points to the crucial importance of strong education and training systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.26,0)">Job polarisation is not just putting increasing pressure on workers with mid-level skills, but also complicating the possibilities for unskilled workers to find more skilled jobs, meaning that they continue to be trapped in low-paid jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The main answer is education and training that disseminates marketable skills more widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Otherwise, there is a risk that, rather than being seen as an agent of jobs and opportunity, structural reforms are seen as a catalyst for a low-wage, precarious economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion Let me sum up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The crisis has confirmed that more flexible economies are more resilient, especially for countries that are part of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Lessons about how to design and implement reforms so as to maximise their benefits and minimise their short-term costs should be put into practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Reforms have to take into account equity as well as efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Vested interests have to be tackled and those who have lost out given proper support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">With monetary policy being accommodative, we now have a window of opportunity to take these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I hope the insights at this conference can move this agenda forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This holds true for both the countries that joined the euro area early on   and the former communist countries that joined later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">However, for a given “Doing Business” level   the latter group seem to have generally outperformed the former, possibly due to their larger catching-up potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.24,0)">39-63; Vansteenkiste, I.  , “Did the
