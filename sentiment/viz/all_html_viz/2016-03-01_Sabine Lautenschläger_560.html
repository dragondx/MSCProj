    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)"> Navigating uncertainty – governance, risk management and leveraged finance Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board,at the 17th Annual Risk Management Convention by the Global Association of Risk Professionals, 1 March 2016, New York Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today, as it gives me a welcome opportunity to exchange ideas on risks and risk management with high-ranking risk managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Discussing topics of risk management is doubtless necessary given the current macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.05,0)">In 2008, the financial crisis turned the Great Moderation into the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.37,0)">Today, almost eight years later, we still live in challenging times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.48,0)">The Great Recession has now turned into the Great Uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.18,0)">Quite recently, financial markets experienced another flare-up of that uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.79,0)">Share prices of European banks, for instance, have been extremely volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.16,0)">On some days, we saw prices rise or fall in double digits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.12,0)">Regarding the causes, it seems that markets were driven by a broad set of worries relating to three different areas: first, the state of the global economy, including weak growth and weak investment, uncertainty with regard to China and emerging markets, as well as worries about the impact of low oil prices on the financial sector; second, the new regulatory environment, including the concrete implementation of the new bail-in regime established by the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive; and third, some idiosyncratic issues that caused broader concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">When you listen to some observers, you might get the impression that 2008 is not far away these days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Personally, I would rather argue that it is reasonably far away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In terms of capital ratios as a measure of the resilience of banks, it is actually a couple of percentage points away – since 2008, banks in the euro area have increased their Tier 1 capital ratios from 8.4% to 13.7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">After all, it is not just a matter of the amount of capital held by the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.23,0)">It is also a question of capital quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">And that, too, improved dramatically as a result of regulatory reforms in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Euro area banks focus on Common Equity Tier 1 or CET1, the highest quality of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The average fully-loaded CET1 ratio of all banks directly supervised by the ECB stood at 12% at the end of last year and will have moved beyond this mark as we speak, pending annual results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In addition, the euro area addressed risks in banks’ balance sheets with an unprecedented project in 2014 – the comprehensive assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Not only did that exercise lead to a common definition of non-performing loans for the first time, it also led to a significant increase in provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Altogether, the banking system is much more resilient today than it was in 2008 – not least thanks to an improved regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Still, in more general terms, we cannot deny the existence of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is particularly true for the financial market, whose core function is to allocate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Each and every financial institution must therefore cope with risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.14,0)">Alas, this is more difficult than it sounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">Acknowledging risks – there is no such thing as a free lunch For a start, there are those risks that cannot be foreseen, the famous black swans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.07,0)">Such risks cannot be managed in any meaningful way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In fact, the only option is to increase resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For banks, the universal buffer against all kinds of unexpected shocks is capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">And, on the capital front, much has been done over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">As I already mentioned, banks around the world have increased their capital ratios since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In terms of capital, banks in Europe are therefore much better prepared for those risks that cannot yet be foreseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But then there are those risks that can be foreseen – they can be measured and managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is these risks that are particularly relevant for risk management in banks, following an economic dictum that has been attributed to several people over the years, including an author of science fiction novels and an American General.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.04,0)">The general was Leonard Porter Ayres, who also worked as a statistician and economist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">When asked by a group of reporters to impart some words of wisdom gathered from his long years of economic study, Ayres replied: “It is an immutable economic fact that there is no such thing as a free lunch.” I am pretty sure that everyone in this room has used that phrase at least once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Translated into the language of finance, it reads: whoever wants to make a profit has to take a risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The returns, however, are mostly generated right away, whereas the risk might only materialise in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is where good risk management comes into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Banks and the entire banking system have indeed become much more resilient to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Nevertheless, good risk management is still necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It should enrich decision-making by providing a medium and long-term view, and it should highlight the downside to every upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.09,0)">In a way, risk managers have to be the spoilsports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The same is, of course, true for banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.44,0)">One of the tasks of banking supervisors is to ask questions when things are going well, and to intervene when they are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Therefore, risk managers, as well as banking supervisors, explicitly advocate a forward-looking, risk-based approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And this is what European banking supervision is doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Our main tool towards that end is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, SREP for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this process, we conduct a risk assessment for each institution, not only evaluating its current and future risk levels, but also its risk controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We review the internal processes followed by institutions in order to determine the appropriate capital and liquidity levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And we consider the risk an institution poses to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Finally, we apply a method to quantify capital and liquidity needs, based on the results of our risk analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As a result, we might require institutions to hold capital and liquidity buffers over and above regulatory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.01,0)">This institution-specific view is supplemented by a horizontal analysis of risks, which also considers system-wide risks, such as those arising from global imbalances, excessive risk concentrations in certain sectors or declining standards in business deals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The objective is to obtain a broader picture of the risk situation in the banking sector and to evaluate key market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Together, the institution-specific view and the horizontal analysis can provide us with a sound understanding of risks in the entire banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So for risk managers as well as for banking supervisors, it is important to take a medium to long-term perspective, anticipate potential problems and act when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me now give you an example of that approach, one which illustrates how important it is to identify and manage risks before they become so big that they can hardly be managed at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">And it illustrates the potential of risk managers to act as spoilsports in the short term, while preserving the sustainability of business models in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">I am referring to leveraged finance, which comprises instruments such as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Assessing risks – the issue of leveraged finance The market for leveraged finance is certainly a market with potential – with potential that other markets can only dream of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">After contracting sharply during the financial crisis, it has expanded rapidly in recent years, not least driven by a search for yield against the backdrop of a prolonged period of very low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">According to a study by Crédit Suisse, the global market for leveraged finance grew by almost 42% between 2011 and 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Banks in the euro area followed that trend – between 2012 and 2014, they increased their exposures to leveraged loans by 16%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.3,0)">Do I worry about leveraged finance in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.07,0)">By comparison, the share of euro area banks in the global market for leveraged finance remains limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.65,0)">In 2014, banks in the euro area accounted for no more than about 15% of all leveraged loans that were arranged at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.86,0)">At the same time, leveraged finance accounts for just 1% of their assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Nevertheless, akin to efforts in the United States, European banking supervision decided to look closely at these exposures – taking a forward-looking and pre-emptive approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The growth of the market indeed seems to be driven by a search for yield.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">And on the face of it, leveraged finance does provide comparatively high yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In 2014, leveraged-finance products generated more than €5 billion of net revenues for European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In particular, leveraged finance offers an opportunity to increase fee incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Accordingly, the volume of underwritten transactions has increased by 35% since 2012, whereas the volume of deals that banks hold in their own books has only increased by 16%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It would appear that banks are doing it for the fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.49,0)">Still, other factors besides a search for yield are driving the market for leveraged finance: corporate refinancing schedules, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In 2014, about 52% of transactions took place in order to renew or refinance previous deals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Also, greater confidence among investors might play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.31,0)">Rating agencies, banks and investment funds have communicated profusely on low default rates and the general attractiveness of the market for leveraged finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.59,0)">However, the border between confidence and overconfidence is hard to define.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Therefore, the question is: should we keep an eye on leveraged finance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">My answer as a supervisor is: yes, we should.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Leveraged finance is certainly not a major supervisory concern at the moment, but the recent development of the relevant market exemplifies the need for good risk governance, a well-defined and closely monitored framework for risk appetite and highly assertive risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.65,0)">Search for yield has intensified competition in the market for leveraged finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The result is that the terms for borrowers have become more favourable – ultimately, that increases the risks for the lender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We as supervisors take a close look at the credit quality of borrowers as measured by their level of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.68,0)">Lending to highly leveraged counterparts may entail significant risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">And in the euro area, we observe that the leverage of corporate borrowers has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In 2014, 35% of transactions arranged by significant institutions actually refinanced borrowers at an increased level of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.2,0)">Moreover, we as supervisors are not always impressed by the quality of loan contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">Some loans contain only limited obligations for borrowers, for instance with regard to payment terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Particularly when refinancing or renewing commitments, banks might be inclined to accept the removal of covenants in order to preserve existing commercial relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We as supervisors also care about returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Banks are taking on risks; but do they gain adequate returns?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Well, over the entire credit cycle, they may not necessarily earn more returns because there are other factors at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.8,0)">Today, fierce competition is one of the factors that depress returns despite the increase in risks; it might prompt some banks to reduce fees in order to increase their market share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.89,0)">And tomorrow, the credit cycle might reverse and default rates surge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.03,0)">Such a scenario ultimately raises the issue of default-recognition methodologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And last but not least, there is also the reputational perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">By acting as underwriters in leveraged-finance deals, banks also distribute a certain amount of exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In 2014, around €50 billion of leveraged-loan exposures were distributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Nevertheless, from a reputational perspective and to avoid potential mis-selling practices, the quality of the distributed assets is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">And currently, 21% of exposures retained by banks are covenant-lite, against 74% of those that they distribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">To sum up: banks appear to be increasing their exposure to the growing market for leveraged finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The leverage levels of borrowers are increasing, while constraints on loan contracts are being removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As I said earlier on, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and ultimately, it is the task of risk managers to ensure that the price is adequate – risk and return have to remain in balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Among other things, this requires forward-looking risk assessments, conservative collateral valuations, continuous monitoring of the borrower’s risk profile, and rapid reactions to changing circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Addressing risks – risk management and banking supervision The market environment I just described undoubtedly calls for effective risk management in order to curb potential excess.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.05,0)">However, with regard to leveraged finance, risk managers find it difficult to appropriately and effectively play their role in a market environment characterised by fierce competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">More specifically, there are three areas where we are currently pushing for improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.91,0)">First, with regard to procedure, historical credit norms are beginning to weaken and more market-friendly structures have been adopted – I already mentioned the covenant-lite issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.78,0)">In that regard, the thorniest aspect is the credit approval process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The speed of credit approval has become a cornerstone of competitiveness in the market for leveraged finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In order to increase their market share, banks have significantly shortened their internal validation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">Anecdotal evidence suggests that many deals are presented by the borrowers as “take it or leave it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In some cases, potential borrowers requested approval within 48 hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.8,0)">To me, it seems rather challenging to properly understand a deal within 48 hours – both for the front office as well as for risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Second, with regard to limits, risk managers need to be alert regarding a shift towards structures that support an expanding business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.43,0)">Most banks have limits in place with regard to exposures held on their own books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, these limits have sometimes been shifted upwards to accommodate business needs and the prospect of rewarding transactions; the underwriting limit, for instance, has on average increased by 49% between 2012 and 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In such circumstances, risk managers should ensure that stress tests adequately reflect the higher limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.47,0)">In any case, from a supervisor’s perspective, large underwriters could be expected to avoid too much fluctuation in their limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Third, with regard to stress testing, all banks should conduct dedicated stress tests for their leveraged finance portfolios – I mentioned that before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Such stress tests are helpful in identifying the consequences of downturns in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Therefore, as part of our planned supervisory actions, stress-testing frameworks will be strengthened, particularly with regard to the underwriting pipeline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">To sum up: the European market for leveraged finance has grown, and European banks have increased their exposure to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We as supervisors are closely monitoring these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But we go beyond mere observation; we are also acting, combining individual and SSM-wide actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.71,0)">First, we will address potential weaknesses at the level of individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Second, we are thinking about issuing relevant guidelines in order to define a common set of expectations for the entire banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end with another quote from Leonard Porter Ayres.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.67,0)">In September 1930, he said: “Now arises the emotion of fear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Things were brighter looking than they were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.96,0)">Now they look darker than they are.” To me, that quote perfectly describes the psychology of markets – or rather the psychology of human beings who constantly sway between being overly optimistic and overly pessimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.52,0)">Risk managers and supervisors have to fight that impulse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.15,0)">We have to see things as they are, and not as we wish or fear them to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">That requires self-control, independence and far-sightedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And to be effective, it requires a voice that is heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.2,0)">Having said that, do I see leveraged finance as the major risk for the European banking system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I do not see it as the biggest risk, but I see a certain danger that market players see things a tad brighter than they are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">So it is up to me as a supervisor and up to you as risk managers to counterbalance this view.</span>
