    <span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)"> Western Democracy and its Discontents: Economic and Political Challenges Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Aspen Transatlantic Dialogue: “Western Democracies under Pressure”, Rome, 14 October 2010 The theme of this conference, especially this first session, which concerns the ability of democratic systems to cope with the challenges of economic and financial crisis, has been addressed in the past by distinguished scholars such as Ralf Dahrendorf.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.91,0)">He observed that: “To stay competitive in a growing world economy   are obliged to adopt measures which may inflict irreparable damage on the cohesion of the respective civil societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.7,0)">If they are unprepared to take these measures, they must recur to restrictions of civil liberties and of political participation bearing all the hallmarks of a new authoritarianism...The task for the first world in the next decade is to square the circle between growth, social cohesion and political freedom.”   This comment was written in the mid-1990s, but the current crisis makes it even more pertinent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.23,0)">It’s an expression of doubt about the ability of   advanced countries to be able to take unpopular but necessary measures to overcome the crisis that is prompting financial markets to disinvest, or even bet on those countries’ bankruptcy, resulting in an outflow of capital that prolongs the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">What lessons can we draw from this crisis in respect of the functioning of democratic systems, and in particular their ability to meet the challenges of the global economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me try to provide some answers, starting with three thoughts on the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.44,0)">The first one concerns the causes of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.8,0)">Reams of commentary have been produced on the factors that unleashed it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.53,0)">Some commentators have focused on the shortcomings of the financial regulations, or on the ineffective supervision of markets and market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.76,0)">Others have pointed to the excessive monetary expansion in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.09,0)">Others still have remarked that the lack of international coordination has generated large global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There is a grain of truth in each of these analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.48,0)">But if we stay at this level of detail we risk missing the essence of the problem and not finding a remedy for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.85,0)">We have to ask why the regulations were inadequate, why monetary policies were so loose, why international cooperation was insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.7,0)">Were they simple human errors, or errors caused by factors more deeply rooted in our societies – ones which touch on the subject of today’s discussion?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Few have embarked on this kind of reflection – an essential one if we are to understand the crisis and how to get out of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Raghu Rajan, for example, takes as a starting point the increase in inequality that has occurred in recent years in advanced societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.83,0)">It has resulted in a stagnation of the incomes of the middle classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.03,0)">Technological change in recent years has increased the productivity gap in various sectors of the economy and led to sharp differences in income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.53,0)">Another contributing factor has been, in my view, the rapid change in the comparative advantage of advanced economies associated with the globalisation process, which has hurt the less well-educated members of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Technological change and economic integration have been taking place for centuries and have driven economic systems towards new equilibria in which well-being has generally increased for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.53,0)">There is no reason why these processes should come to an end now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.75,0)">But they involve periods of transition during which a significant dislocation of resources may take place and some segments of the population may incur a relative impoverishment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.33,0)">Economic growth may even slow down and make the inequalities worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.1,0)">The transition may also persist if the factors that triggered the changes are systemic in nature and scale, as is the shift by hundreds of millions of people to the market economy which started in the late 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is during the transition that financial engineering comes into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Finance makes it possible to bring the future forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Those who expect an increase in income can, thanks to new financial instruments, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">debt, immediately increase their consumption and move on to a higher standard of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They can, say, purchase a house, send their children to college and buy a powerful car.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Financial engineering meets the needs of those who are not yet able to afford them, increases the revenue of financial institutions – and thus of the shareholders and managers – and raises government revenues too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Financial engineering helps to solve the transition problems of advanced societies facing changes arising from technological innovation and globalisation, especially for the poorer segments of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Financial innovation is thus favoured and encouraged by all the political forces, as Rajan notes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This explains the “affordable housing” measures taken by the Clinton administration and the “ownership society” of the Bush administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Financial innovation has also been facilitated by the interest rates kept low for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.79,0)">The problem arises – and arose – when the transition to the new equilibrium is very long, longer than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.81,0)">If the transition is longer than expected, financial engineering is no longer a solution and can become a problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.91,0)">The debt burden becomes unsustainable and cannot be repaid, starting by the less well-off, whose incomes do not keep pace with property values inflated by low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.83,0)">The sub-prime crisis was created by excessive debt, taken on not by the wealthy, as happened on other occasions in the past, but by the less well-off, whose relative position in society was slipping.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Debt had given them the illusion of being able to live for a few years beyond their means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.83,0)">The gist of this first thought is that the crisis sprang from an unsuccessful attempt to square Dahrendorf’s circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.32,0)">The failure involved not recognising that technological and global processes bring about a longer and more difficult than expected transition for one part of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It consisted of deluding oneself that such a transition can be facilitated by easy debt and low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Recognising this failure is the first step towards not failing again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The second thought comes from the way in which our societies have responded to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.89,0)">Without making a value judgement, but considering only the efficiency and timeliness of actions that have been implemented to tackle the crisis and counter its negative effects, there is no denying that in most cases the reaction has been slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.98,0)">This slowness has added to the cost of the crisis itself and to the scale of the adjustment required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me offer a couple of examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.47,0)">If Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy had been avoided in September 2008, through an effective and timely intervention, there would probably not have been the collapse of confidence that in the months thereafter affected the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The rescue package – TARP – would very probably have been much less than the USD 700 billion needed to restore calm to the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.75,0)">In Europe – to take another example – if the Greek government had decided to intervene with corrective action as early as autumn 2009, having just discovered the budget hole left by its predecessor, it could have avoided the sovereign debt crisis and the drastic adjustment programme which it then had to put in place under pressure from the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">If the European countries had agreed in early February to provide financial support for Greece’s adjustment programme, they would probably have avoided the escalation of tensions in the markets last spring and the associated crisis of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.21,0)">They would have avoided paying out the enormous sums which became necessary when Greece lost access to the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.23,0)">These examples show that in developed countries the economic policy measures necessary to maintain the confidence of the markets tend to be taken only when markets are on the brink or in the middle of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Only under pressure from the markets do governments seem to find the strength and the consensus to adopt the necessary measures to ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.67,0)">This increases the scale of the adjustment required and consequently the negative repercussions for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.35,0)">The doubts about the ability of governments to take the necessary measures in turn increases the distrust of financial markets and tends to intensify the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.83,0)">How does this vicious circle come about?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me try to identify some factors that characterise the problems that our societies face in reaching a consensus on decisive action in a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.8,0)">The first factor concerns how the financial crisis is perceived by the public and sometimes even by economic policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.25,0)">In our affluent societies, accustomed to economic growth and well-being, most people do not understand the risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.08,0)">Moreover, there were few, even in the inner circle of decision-makers, who understood the gravity of the situation in which the markets found themselves in early May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.55,0)">The second factor is that, in the face of systemic crises, such as the one through which we have passed, those who govern must sometimes take decisions that infringe long-term rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.83,0)">The most striking case is the rescue of a bank or a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.18,0)">In theory this should not occur because taxpayers' money should not be used to save those who have misbehaved or failed to comply with the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.92,0)">But in some cases it is necessary in order to avoid a systemic crisis that can have even more devastating effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.39,0)">In a democratic system it is very difficult to convince voters, especially if they do not perceive any imminent danger, that in some cases a discretionary interpretation of the rule is needed to avoid the worst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This was shown clearly in Europe when it came to deciding on the support package for Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.77,0)">In the U.S., the administration was unable to go against the widely held sentiment, which was opposed to the use of public funds to save a bank, and decided to let Lehman Brothers fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The subsequent rescue of AIG to avoid panic and financial ruin then turned out to be much more expensive for taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Fortunately we avoided this in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.17,0)">Let me move on to my third and last thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.86,0)">It concerns the post-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.98,0)">The industrialised countries are emerging from the crisis poorer, more indebted and with lower prospects for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The process of fiscal consolidation must remain the cornerstone of economic policy and form the basis for a radical overhaul of the economies in order to create more growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But in the current environment I see two risks facing our democracies in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first one is the illusion that this crisis is cyclical rather than structural, that it has no impact on the long-term growth potential of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">We may, in this case, be deluding ourselves that traditional macroeconomic policies   are per se able to restore growth to pre-crisis levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.63,0)">Thus there is a risk of triggering again unsustainable policies which in turn create new imbalances that sooner or later implode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.81,0)">The second risk is an attitude of resignation, of being resigned to not having the capacity and strength to untie the knots that restrict our growth potential, or of being resigned to economic stagnation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This state of mind is associated with the politician’s dilemma neatly articulated by the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker: “ We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get re-elected once we have done it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.97,0)">This type of reasoning occasionally leads some people to argue that democratic systems are not up to making our societies swallow the medicine needed in order to grow again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.88,0)">Structural reforms in fact involve a redistribution of income to the detriment of the less efficient sectors, which are characterised by monopolistic rents and are strongly opposed to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The idea is often floated that some emerging countries are better able to manage the current crisis because they have ‘stronger’ regimes, which do not need to justify their actions vis-à-vis their electorates very often.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.94,0)">These are dangerous positions in my view and are not justified by empirical evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.74,0)">Juncker’s provocative remark is not in fact substantiated by the facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">He himself is one of Europe’s veteran political leaders, who has brought rigour and development to his country and was re-elected three times in a row.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.05,0)">An analysis of the correlation between economic variables and political popularity in Europe reveals that, contrary to what many believe, budgetary austerity and reforms do not penalise governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Indeed, in recent years in Europe there has been a positive correlation between political popularity and budgetary rigour  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The correlation is much stronger than the one between political popularity and economic growth  , which indicates that, for a given level of growth, healthy public finances reward governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This suggests that political leaders who have the courage and the ability to reconcile balanced public finances with the economic growth are rewarded over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.49,0)">Democratic systems should not to be blamed if advanced economies risk stagnation and do not grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.47,0)">They are in danger only if people succumb to the illusion or become resigned to thinking that democracies do not allow change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.65,0)">Centuries of history demonstrate just the opposite: that without democracy there is no change, and sooner or later there is decline.</span>
