    <span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)"> The possible triangle: frictionless movement of payments, securities and collateral across Europe Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2019 Annual General Meeting of the International Capital Markets Association’s European Repo and Collateral Council, Luxembourg, 31 January 2019 Introduction This year, we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the euro, the single currency of 19 EU countries and over 340 million Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But the euro is not only important for European citizens and businesses; it also has a global role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In fact, it is the second most used currency in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">More than 50 countries or territories in the world use or link their currency to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">More than 20% of the international reserves held by central banks outside the euro area are in euro  – a percentage that exceeds the euro area’s share in global production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Furthermore, the euro has become a widely accepted currency for international payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">In 2017 about 36% of international transactions – in value terms – were invoiced or settled in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.35,0)">The status of global currency is a double-edged sword.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Having more weight as an international currency comes with pros and cons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The list of traditional benefits includes higher seigniorage and lower transaction and hedging costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">And – following the experience of recent decades – we can now add the better protection of domestic inflation and reduced dependence on monetary policy decisions of other major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">But the euro’s role as an international currency also comes with increased responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">International currencies must be backed by large, stable and efficiently functioning economies and financial systems that are attractive to international users and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">And last but not least, the effect of monetary policy on import prices is reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB has always held that the international role of the euro develops as a result of market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Accordingly, the internationalisation of the euro as such has never been a policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In December 2018, however, the European Commission presented a set of action points to strengthen the euro’s global role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To this end, the euro should become even more compelling as a means of payment and a trustworthy investment currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These action points include the completion of Economic and Monetary Union, banking union and capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Moreover, and without prejudice to the ECB’s independence, we take note of the Commission’s support for our initiatives on market infrastructure and payments, which help to increase efficiency and financial market integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Although it is not in our mandate to establish or promote the euro as a global currency, the ECB’s responsibility for promoting the smooth operation of payment systems indirectly supports the international standing of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Since the launch of the euro, the Eurosystem has indeed contributed to reshaping and consolidating the infrastructure for large-value payments, for post-trading services for financial instruments and, most recently, for instant retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The goal is to create a truly single financial market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In such a single market, payments, securities and collateral could be moved safely and efficiently between market participants in different countries without friction or restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Today I will briefly look back at what has been achieved so far and discuss how the Eurosystem will move forward over the next two or three years by taking measures to consolidate TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities  , in particular by delivering a centralised liquidity management function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Furthermore, to increase efficiency in the mobilisation and management of collateral and further level the playing field for Eurosystem counterparties, the Eurosystem is developing a single collateral management system that will be capable of managing the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations for all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In a complementary initiative, the Eurosystem has launched comprehensive work on collateral management harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">TARGET consolidation: strengthening the backbone of the European financial market TARGET2 and its predecessor are the longest-standing components of the Eurosystem’s financial market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Today, TARGET2 is one of the biggest payment systems in the world, processing 90 % of the total value settled by large-value payment systems in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">T2S, the integrated IT platform which processes the real-time settlement of securities transactions against central bank money across Europe, was launched in 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Full migration took place in waves over the following two years to ensure a smooth transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">T2S facilitates the establishment of a single pool of collateral for banks and intermediaries to settle their entire European business in central bank money, thereby optimising settlement and triparty procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">With the introduction of T2S, the average cost per transaction at market infrastructure level has decreased significantly – in particular for transactions between central securities depositories  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Our cost estimates indicated that, before T2S was launched, the average fee per domestic CSD settlement in the euro area was 73 cent, while cross-border transactions were up to ten times more expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.54,0)">T2S has brought the transaction fee per instruction down to a much lower level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Initially, the delivery-versus-payment price for T2S was set at 15 cent per instruction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.36,0)">However, the effects of the financial crisis and delays in the migration of certain T2S markets reduced T2S volume and income in the first few years of its operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a result, the T2S pricing structure was adjusted, and fees per instruction were increased from 15 cent to 19.5 cent, plus a temporary surcharge of 4 cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.52,0)">This is still substantially lower than the average fees of 73 cent observed before the launch of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">T2S has also been a catalyst for harmonising the post-trade market in the EU and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Faced initially with a wide variety of different practices across European markets, the sound T2S governance structure fostered collaboration between stakeholders, who soon recognised the added value of harmonisation for their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.3,0)">The integration of ancillary processes and legal frameworks to a large extent dismantled several of the barriers that had hitherto hindered efficient cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These barriers were identified as early as 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Last but not least, in November 2018 the Eurosystem delivered TARGET Instant Payment Settlement  , a truly domestic market infrastructure for pan-European instant payments with settlement in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">TIPS enables payment service providers to offer fund transfers to their customers in less than ten seconds around the clock, every day of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The upcoming technical and functional convergence of TARGET2 and T2S will further optimise liquidity management and generate new cost efficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In particular, the consolidation project, which will run until 2021, will introduce a central liquidity management system that will allow participants to monitor and manage their liquidity for all TARGET services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">More specifically, it will provide a central liquidity overview on a single screen with easy access to more detailed information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It will enable centralised management and control over the payment capacity with a clear allocation of liquidity for the different settlement purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Real-time gross settlement participation will be segregated from interaction with central banks for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The minimum reserve calculation and automatic marginal lending facility will take into account balances in other Eurosystem market infrastructures, such as TIPS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In summary, the introduction of central liquidity management within the new TARGET services makes the use of central bank money even more efficient for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Thanks to the joint public-private efforts, major steps have been taken to overcome the fragmentation in the European securities trade and post-trade market over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">At the front end of the process chain, however, there is still much to be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.66,0)">For instance, the issuance and distribution of securities still hinges on fragmented legacy standards, structural constraints and complex market practices at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.43,0)">Furthermore, facilitating interactions and procedures between some participants still entails high costs and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">European issuers and in particular EU institutions needs to collect funds from investors across the continent deserve fair consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Reflection on pan-European issuance and distribution channel in the most efficient manner would be in line with the endeavour to deepen the single capital market in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This could have a positive impact on the establishment of a domestic yield curve for the euro money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Should market participants propose solutions in this area, the ECB will certainly take them into consideration in our own investigation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Collateral management harmonisation The second element of the process of pushing for a truly single financial market is the further harmonisation of collateral management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Following the successful harmonisation of market practices in the context of T2S  , the Eurosystem, together with key European financial market stakeholders, is working towards extending such harmonisation benefits to the field of collateral management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The core innovation in this work is that all interaction will be based on ISO 20022 standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">A single model for triparty collateral management based on these standards will allow market participants to benefit from enhanced features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This will also facilitate improved reporting capabilities to support the needs of treasurers and to meet regulatory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Furthermore, the harmonised handling of corporate actions will ensure that securities can remain part of the collateral pool in the event of a corporate action, thus obviating the need for their substitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Further collateral management harmonisation work will cover, for example, bilateral collateral management and margin calls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">To facilitate implementation, we are working together with the market on a single rulebook for collateral management in Europe which we plan to publish later this year, together with a roadmap for harmonised post-trade services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB is counting on the continued support of market participants in this work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Early engagement is needed, and it is critical that preparations for the implementation of these – as yet to be developed – standards start now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The Eurosystem has taken advantage of the progress made so far in collateral harmonisation when designing the Eurosystem collateral management system  , which is currently being built.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The system is due to go live in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It will – if agreed – replace the individual collateral management systems currently in use by Eurosystem national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Counterparties, central securities depositories and triparty agents in different countries, which today interact with national central banks through those national collateral management systems, will in future be able to use the same harmonised system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This will simplify processes that involve multiple jurisdictions, notably the mobilisation of cross-border collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The ECMS has considerable potential to trigger a wider harmonisation of collateral management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Given that the demand for collateral and the interest in collateralised transactions has grown substantially in recent years, for example owing to the increased need for collateral as a margin for centrally cleared and bilateral derivative transactions, collateral mobility has become an even more valuable attribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is why we are taking action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Potential issues in the repo market Let me make a few remarks on potential issues in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The secured segment is the largest segment of the euro money market, representing two-thirds of the total money market turnover, and is an important contributor to the overall resilience and efficiency of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Several factors explain the resilience of the secured segment to the crisis: the demand for high-quality and liquid securities for regulatory purposes and for covering margin calls at CCPs; the protection against counterparty risk through collateral; the impact of the asset purchase programme, which reduced the supply of collateral effectively available to the market and boosted the supply of excess liquidity, offering business opportunities for those with access to the Eurosystem deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Turnover in the secured segment has increased significantly since the third quarter of 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">In an environment of excess liquidity, and with a purchase programme acquiring large quantities of euro-denominated securities, the activity is mainly driven by the demand for securities rather than by funding needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This demand for securities is fuelled by regulatory requirements, by the need for collateral to cover margin calls in order to trade over-the-counter interest rate derivatives via CCPs, and by the supporting role of security financing transactions for fixed income desks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The evolution of prices in the last two years also highlights how the repo market has become largely a platform for collateral exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.32,0)">Rates move from above to below the deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.2,0)">For many securities, demand has become so strong that counterparties searching for that security agree on a repo rate that is less favourable than the central bank’s deposit rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me briefly touch upon our asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.01,0)">Certain factors, most notably new regulations, have led to increased bond scarcity and consequently to an increased share of bonds that trade “special”, especially ahead of reporting dates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In order to support the smooth implementation of the public sector purchase programme as well as the liquidity and functioning of the euro area repo market, in December 2016 we introduced the option of borrowing securities against cash collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This technical amendment, along with some others, made our facilities more accessible and was one of the contributing factors to the subsequent improved repo market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.48,0)">In 2017, and even more so in 2018, we generally observed lower repo market tensions ahead of quarter-ends and futures delivery dates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.2,0)">The ERCC's recent report concluded that the 2018 year-end in the repo market was relatively uneventful, and we at the ECB share this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">In just 20 years, the euro has become the second most used currency in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Its global success relies on a large, stable and efficient economy, as well as a financial system that is attractive to international users and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In its provision of safe and efficient financial market infrastructure services, the Eurosystem plays an integral role in strengthening the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Our current activities – the consolidation of TARGET2 and T2S and the mobilisation and management of collateral through the development of the ECMS – are the cornerstones of the Eurosystem’s ambitious agenda up to 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">All these enhancements will help improve the functioning of the repo market, responding to some of your concerns on the post-crisis context, with the effect of allowing greater and more fluid movement of payments, securities and collateral across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">I therefore strongly encourage the post-trade industry to embrace the collateral management harmonisation agenda and to start preparing already for its implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Efforts will be required from all of us, but the ultimate goal of efficient harmonised collateral management will greatly benefit Europe at large and support a truly single financial market in Europe that will underpin European autonomy in the globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">For instance, the price of German sovereign collateral is fuelled by the strong demand for high quality and liquid assets and the impact of the asset purchase programme on collateral supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.78,0)">Moreover, around the year-end, repo rates on the securities with higher ratings decline further to levels significantly below the deposit facility.</span>
