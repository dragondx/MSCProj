    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)"> Europe – past, present and future Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Meeting with students at Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, 14 May 2018 It’s always nice to visit universities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">They are special places, meant for the free exchange of ideas – places where bold thinking is encouraged and the orthodoxy challenged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So today I’m going to step back from the technical aspects of my day-to-day work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I’m going to take some time to reflect instead on the big picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will first talk about some of the EU’s historical milestones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">After that, I will tell you a bit about my work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And once I’ve finished my brief remarks, I look forward to answering your questions – and to asking you some of my own!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Looking back to look forward As students of economics, many of you will, I’m sure, have read articles and books about the future of European Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Some of you may even have read about the new system for banking supervision and resolution – the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I hope you have enjoyed learning about these topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But I also think it’s important for students to look beyond technical policy debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">From time to time, it’s good practice to go back to the fundamental questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Things like: what has the European Union achieved in the past 60 years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And what would we like it to achieve in the next 60?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We insiders would also benefit from this kind of reflection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.37,0)">In the humdrum of meetings, papers, non-papers and briefings, I feel that we do not take enough time to reflect on the achievements of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Nor, perhaps, do we think enough about the strategic, long-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">So today I hope that, together, we can do just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let us start by travelling back in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Let’s try to put ourselves in the shoes of a European citizen in 1945.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.69,0)">Whether we imagine this person living in Paris, Berlin, Rome or Copenhagen, we know they are living in a country scarred by war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Now, if this person were able to see what the future would hold from 1945 to 2018, they would find it in many ways almost miraculous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">For one thing, anyone over the age of 27 in 1945 had lived through two world wars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">So, they would be happy to discover their countries would see more than seventy consecutive years of peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I believe the European Union has played a large role in ensuring such long-lasting peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.45,0)">It seems that Robert Schuman was right to predict that the European Coal and Steel Community would make war both unthinkable and materially impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">And peace on the European continent has also meant the spread of democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">When the Treaty of Rome was signed, only 12 of the current EU Member States were democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">Today all 28 of them are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And with democracy came freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">With the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU enshrined all personal, civic, political, economic and social rights within one document.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The Charter also established the right to data protection, guarantees on bioethics and transparent administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I am sure you recognise how topical these issues are today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">And I hope you appreciate the unprecedented protections that EU citizens enjoy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Peace, democracy and freedom in turn brought prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.16,0)">Of course, we still face challenges on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.39,0)">Some EU countries today face difficult economic conditions, largely a legacy of the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.76,0)">Employment levels still vary significantly across the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.3,0)">And high levels of inequality exist within countries too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">OECD data show that in many European countries, a small minority owns a disproportionately large share of the wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.88,0)">Income inequality is also higher than it was a generation ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">But let us not forget the shared economic benefits of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The average GDP per capita of EU countries has almost doubled in the past 20 years alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And our future prosperity is also a function of today’s education, research and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Some of the best universities in the world are located in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Over the past 30 years, around 9 million people have benefited from the Erasmus programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The EU also supports research across the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Horizon 2020 is the largest multinational research programme in existence, providing around €77 billion in funding over seven years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">All of these historic steps have been achieved in the spirit of unity in diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But there is no denying the fact that such unity is hard to manage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Resolving the challenges ahead will involve negotiations between all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And each of them has slightly different priorities and views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Moving forward will take time and effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">But if we want this effort to be meaningful, we must reflect on the long-term goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As far as I am concerned, one goal should be to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">To do so, we must be willing to accept meaningful changes to the institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As I have said in the past, a good starting point would be to assign powers to a European finance minister.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In keeping with the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty, the finance minister could coordinate national economic policies in a different way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">He or she could ensure that national fiscal policy is conducted with a view to contributing to the achievement of the EU’s objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.54,0)">The trouble for politicians is that voters may feel that granting greater scope at the EU level means taking away from national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But then there are the 70 years of peace; there’s free movement across nearly an entire continent; and there’s the world’s second largest economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">All this shows us that what we sometimes feel may be taking away our national sovereignty is in fact adding meaningful value to our lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And this is why we should take more time to reflect on the achievements of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What’s more, politicians are not the only ones with a role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">European unity starts with each individual; it starts with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">You can each reflect on how you could promote Europe as citizens, as students and as future leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The EU’s crisis response and the banking union Dear students, having asked you to reflect on your role within the Union, it is only fair to tell you about how I do my part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A large portion of my professional life since 2012 has been devoted to the creation of the European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">To understand how the banking union came about, we have to go back to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.43,0)">In the EU, it began as a crisis of the banking system and turned quickly from a financial crisis into the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.01,0)">And many of the troubled banks held large amounts of their own governments’ debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.26,0)">This, together with the fact that some countries were already highly indebted, created a vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.99,0)">And so the sovereign debt crisis emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In June 2012, European leaders announced their intention to create a European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.6,0)">But you may ask: why would a Union change things?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Well, for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, if we want to foster a healthy European banking market that can also serve the real economy in a downturn, we should make sure banks are all subject to the same rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And to the same unbiased, intrusive supervision and resolution practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In 2009, the EU had already started working on common rules for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These became what is known as the single rulebook – a single framework for financial institutions in all 28 EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.96,0)">But writing the rules was not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">So, the second step was to build European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And so the Single Supervisory Mechanism, or SSM for short, was created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">It is made up of the ECB and the national supervisors of the 19 euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.2,0)">The ECB directly supervises the largest banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Smaller banks are still supervised at the national level, but in close cooperation with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Our job is to contribute to a healthy and resilient banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We make sure each bank respects the rules it is subject to and is supervised according to the same approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This creates a level-playing field for all banks across the euro area and avoids supervisory arbitrage and national bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The next step was to create a European system to deal with bank failures: the Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This step represented a larger paradigm shift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.64,0)">Banks should no longer be rescued using taxpayers’ money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.17,0)">Those who have reaped the benefits, that is the investors and creditors, should pay first if things go wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This helps to keep incentives healthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But let’s go back to the institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Single Resolution Board, or SRB for short, is at the centre of the Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The SSM and the SRB cooperate closely when a bank is in trouble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.77,0)">The decision to declare that a bank is failing or likely to fail is made by us as supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.5,0)">At that point, when a bank fails, the SRB takes over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.83,0)">It decides whether a bank should be resolved at the European level, or wound up under national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The details of this process are complex, and I’m happy to tell you more if you are interested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But the bottom line is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The mechanism aims to minimise both the impact of bank failures on financial stability and their cost to taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.1,0)">But resolution is not the final piece of the puzzle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">Nor is it the final pillar of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It was envisaged that the banking union would be supported by three pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">European banking supervision and resolution are the first two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The third pillar is a European deposit insurance scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is still in the making, but its importance is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">For there to be a true banking union, depositors in all countries need to have the same level of confidence in their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This is especially important as the banking union currently has the same member countries as the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And in a monetary union, people must be certain that their money is equally safe, wherever it is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">A euro must be a euro, no matter whether it is deposited in a German bank, an Irish bank or a Spanish bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Conclusion: let’s talk Dear students, I have talked for quite a long time now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I have talked about some of the EU’s historic achievements over the past 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">And I have talked about what has been achieved in the last six years, with the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But as I said earlier, universities are places to exchange ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So now I would like to hear your thoughts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.21,0)">For one thing, I would like to know whether you ever feel something important is missing from the policy debates about the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Is there a Danish perspective you wish was more central at the EU level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.73,0)">Or a European perspective you think is missing from the Danish policy debate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Thank you for your attention!</span>
