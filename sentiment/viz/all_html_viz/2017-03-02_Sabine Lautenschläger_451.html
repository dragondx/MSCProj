    <h1> The European banking sector - growing together and growing apart </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the LSE German Symposium, London, 2 March 2017 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> The European banking sector – growing together and growing apart Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB,at the LSE German Symposium,London, 2 March 2017 Two major events provide the frame for my speech today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.26,0)">Both of them took place in June – one in 2012, the other in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.06,0)">One of them took place in Brussels, the other here in the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">One of them made Europe grow together; the other made Europe grow apart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">On 28 June 2012 in Brussels, the leaders of the EU decided to take banking supervision to the European level and explore the idea of a fully fledged banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">They took a decisive step towards a more united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">On 23 June 2016, the people of this country voted to leave the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">They took a decisive step away from a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Both events – while very different in nature – will fundamentally change Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">From the perspective of banks and their supervisors, both events have had and will have a huge impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us take a closer look.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.56,0)">Growing together – European banking supervision In June 2012, the euro area was a bad place to be – if you were an investor, a bank or a country that had lost the trust of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.61,0)">On 1 June that year, the Financial Times wrote “Spain suffers €100 billion exodus”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.16,0)">In the days thereafter, its front-page stories focused on ailing Portuguese and Spanish banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.51,0)">In mid-June, its headline was “Fears rise over EU handling of debt crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">By then the markets had driven the bond yields of some euro area countries to new heights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.29,0)">In other words, if the governments of those countries wanted to sell bonds to finance their debt they would have to pay much more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.49,0)">The media started speculating about a break-up of the euro area, as did some politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.7,0)">Two weeks later though, something had obviously changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">On the last day of June, the Financial Times, on its front page, said “Markets rebound following EU deal”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.02,0)">What had happened?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.9,0)">What had happened was that an EU summit had taken place in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">There, the leaders of the EU agreed on a package of measures to stabilise the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">They decided on a €120 billion pact for growth; they decided that the rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism, could directly recapitalise banks under certain conditions; and they pledged to use the instruments of the rescue funds flexibly and efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Another important element of the package was to create a “Single Supervisory Mechanism”, as it was called.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Banking supervision was to be taken from the national to the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.99,0)">Just two years later, European banking supervision became reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In November 2014, the ECB began to supervise banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But how does the new European system work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And why is it better than the old national ones?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Some people think that the ECB has become the sole supervisor of all banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Well, it is true that European banking supervision has put an end to the patchwork of national supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But in essence, it is a common European undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">In the euro area, we divide banks into two groups: large ones and small ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And it is the 126 largest banking groups which are directly supervised by the ECB – they are called “significant institutions” and account for 82% of the euro area’s banking assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For each of these large banks, we have set up a “Joint Supervisory Team”, or JST.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.88,0)">These JSTs are headed by ECB staff and comprise supervisors from both the national authorities and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.52,0)">It is these teams that actually supervise the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are at the heart of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.1,0)">Alongside the 126 largest banking groups, there are around 3,300 smaller ones, the “less significant” institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">These banks are still directly supervised by the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Nevertheless, the ECB plays a role, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Together with the national authorities, it develops and implements supervisory standards for the smaller banks, and it ensures that supervisors apply these standards across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And not only is the day-to-day supervision of banks a joint task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Decisions are also jointly prepared and adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">The main bodies in this regard are the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">The Supervisory Board is chaired by the ECB and includes representatives from all the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.65,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB in turn comprises the governors of all the euro area central banks and the Executive Board members of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.86,0)">It is true to say that national authorities are no longer responsible for supervising their largest banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But they share their knowledge and experience with the ECB, which directly supervises the largest banks and oversees the entire system of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We have joined forces to make the banking sector safe and sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In my view, this was the right thing to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Over the past decades, the financial system has turned into a global village.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.23,0)">As a result, a crisis, say, affecting a single bank can quickly spread around the entire globe – as happened in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is particularly true for monetary unions such as the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.26,0)">Here, problems can spread even faster and may threaten the financial stability of the entire union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Therefore, European banking supervision brings real benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It allows us to look beyond national borders and national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">When we supervise banks and take decisions, we take a truly European view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">At the same time, we can compare banks across the euro area and gain many more insights than national supervisors could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">We can draw on a huge pool of expertise as our analyses are based on the knowledge and experience not only from the ECB but from across Europe and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">All in all, the ECB itself brings together staff from 28 different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So not only do we have lots of data and information but we also have the resources to analyse it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">All this helps to spot potential problems early on and thoroughly assess their impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">We can combine the best approaches to banking supervision from 19 different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">We can ensure that high standards are uniformly applied in the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">This creates a stable and predictable business environment for banks that operate across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Wherever they go in the euro area, they are supervised to the same standards and methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The idea of harmonisation goes beyond supervision; it is the theme of the entire European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In January 2016, a European resolution mechanism for banks was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It ensures that banks across the euro area can be resolved according to the same rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">A European deposit guarantee has not yet been agreed upon – but even without one we have made good progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Altogether, the banking union helps to create a level playing field for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This is the ground on which a truly European banking sector can emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And contrary to what some people say, a large common market is better than isolated national ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">A common market creates more jobs, more income and more wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">On that note, let us move to the second part of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Growing apart – Brexit and the banks It seems that by now we have got used to political events that defy all expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Last June, however, it was still a new thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.12,0)">So when a majority of the people of the UK voted to leave the EU, it sent a shockwave not only through Europe, but around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">Indeed, on 23 June 2016, the future changed – or to quote Yogi Berra: “The future ain’t what it used to be”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.67,0)">But what exactly the future will be is still unclear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.32,0)">Official negotiations on Brexit have not even started, and they will take years to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.48,0)">Meanwhile, a cloud of uncertainty is now hanging over everyone, including the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Despite this uncertainty, the banks need to act now to be well prepared for any outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.3,0)">But what does Brexit mean for the banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Well, let us for a moment assume that there will be a ‘hard Brexit’ in the sense that the UK would turn into a third country from the perspective of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.97,0)">As a result, the UK and its banks would lose their access to the single EU market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">Why is that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Currently there are around 40 banking groups in the UK that operate in the EU market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Some of them are British, of course; others are global investment banks, for instance, from the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And there are some smaller groups with roots in Asia and the Middle East.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How do these banks currently access the EU market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Many of them use the EU passport, which was introduced in 1993.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The passport was actually one of the first major steps towards a truly European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When a bank is licensed in one Member State of the EU, it can conduct business in any other Member State – no additional licensing is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.34,0)">In the event of a hard Brexit, these banks would lose the passport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.86,0)">Those banks that fully rely on it would have to seek another point of entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.6,0)">Most obviously, they would have to obtain a licence in an EU country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this is where European banking supervision comes in: it is the ECB that grants banking licences throughout the euro area – for large and small banks alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Moreover, we have no stake in whether UK banks set up shop in Paris, Dublin, Frankfurt or any other euro area city.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We are neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, there is one issue on which I have strong views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Our objective is to make the banking system safe and sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I therefore expect banks which are seeking a licence in the euro area to meet our standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There will be no race to the bottom in banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In particular, I do not see the ECB issuing banking licences to empty shell companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.91,0)">Banks which plan to permanently book all exposures back-to-back with another entity in London might be in for a disappointment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.16,0)">This is not about a full ban of back-to-back booking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We rather aim at ensuring both an adequate local management of all material risks and the resolvability of the euro area entity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Needless to say that I would certainly not accept banks’ booking all exposures with the euro area entity while having their risk management and internal control systems outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">As we expect many banks to apply, I urge them to make up their minds and contact us early on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">We will then decide on an appropriate path for them to meet our expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But one thing has to be clear: eventually, all banks will have to fulfil the high standards of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">We are talking to the banks, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And what we hear is that some of them are thinking about taking other paths into the EU market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are considering complementing or even replacing licensed subsidiaries with other entities – investment firms or branches, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such entities, however, would not come within the scope of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They would continue to be supervised at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Still, investment firms can be quite large and might conduct bank-like business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.22,0)">In countries such as the UK or the US, the largest investment firms are supervised by banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">To achieve greater consistency, regulation in the EU might be adapted – the intermediate holding company might be a part of a potential solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The current review of the European banking rules might provide an opportunity to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For those banks we directly supervise we will in any case keep a close eye on the risks that result from different group structures and from relations between different entities of the same group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Securing continuous market access will be the most pressing issue for UK banks – there’s no doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We know that some of them have already started to address this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And yes, time is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Market access is just the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.99,0)">Related to it are hundreds of other even more technical questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">How to treat financial and risk relations between existing and new entities in the euro area and related UK entities?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How to deal with the internal models that UK banks might want to use in their newly established EU entities?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">How best to continue the fruitful cooperation with our colleagues from the Prudential Regulation Authority?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">After all, our banking systems will remain closely connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.35,0)">Brexit might cut through a sector that is deeply connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.79,0)">Keeping the sector together will be a complex task – legally, operationally, organisationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.1,0)">From whichever angle you look at it, it will be difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I have only scratched the surface here, but that much should have become clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Still, I can assure you that we are prepared for any scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Whatever the UK and the remaining 27 EU members agree upon, European banking supervision stands ready to contribute to a safe and sound banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked a lot about UK-based banks that operate in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">What about banks on the Continent that operate in the UK?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Well, they face the same uncertainty and the same challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">I therefore urge these banks as well to prepare for the new future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.66,0)">Brexit will shake up the banking sector; there’s no doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.76,0)">But how will it affect London as a financial centre?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">Just two Tube stations away from here is Mansion House.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It was there, on 10 November 1986, that the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was invited to speak at the Lord Mayor’s banquet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In her speech, she said that “the City serves not only the City, but the nation as a whole”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This was two weeks after the government had established a new legal framework which deregulated the stock exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The “Big Bang”, as it was called, attracted banks from around the world and turned London into a global financial centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It became a magnet for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And the resulting scale effects have made it even more attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Today, it offers liquid markets, specialist services, solid market infrastructures and a huge pool of talent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.38,0)">More than a million people work in the financial sector and another million work in related services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Altogether, the sector generates about 11% of Britain’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">And there’s no doubt either that the Single Market increased London’s appeal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Because of EU passporting, banks enjoy unlimited access to the European market, as I said just now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And they make the most of that opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Their business in the other 27 EU countries accounts for about one-quarter of revenues of the UK’s financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Take, as an example, the clearing of derivatives that are denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A large number of these deals take place in London – more than 75% in some asset classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB is involved in the oversight of UK central counterparties through supervisory colleges and a Memorandum of Understanding with the UK authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This framework enables us to monitor risks to the euro – also due to good cooperation with our British colleagues and legal certainty afforded by the European Court of Justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In view of Brexit, some might now ask whether it would make sense in the future for the majority of euro clearing to take place outside the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Well, that depends on whether the new framework will offer us the same level of involvement as we have today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">And it depends on whether the new framework will be strong enough to ensure financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">To sum up: access to the European market is important for the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And the financial sector is important for the British economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.93,0)">Losing that access would therefore have an impact – not only on the banking sector itself but also on the UK’s economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We are talking about jobs, income and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The question therefore is: will London remain a global financial centre?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Yes, it will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.42,0)">But at the same time, it might lose part of the business, while Europe might attract some of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The race is on, and many cities are competing for the banks – either to keep them, in the case of London, or to attract them, in the case of other cities in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In the end, there probably won’t be a winner- takes-it-all scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.36,0)">Some banks might go to Dublin, some to Paris, others to Frankfurt or elsewhere in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">As I said, the ECB is neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.85,0)">Still, the competition must not result in a race to the bottom with regard to regulation, supervision or taxation – neither in the UK nor in the rest of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.16,0)">Such a lowering of standards might work in the short term, but in the long term it would do more harm than good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">That is why European banking supervision will not change its policies in the wake of Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In fact, strong rules and strong supervision should attract banks – they boost the reputation of banks, increase people’s trust, and that’s good for business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And above all, strong rules serve a purpose: they help to prevent future crises – not only at a national but also at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.99,0)">And financial crises can be very costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The financial sector will always test the boundaries of regulation; it will always look for the best deal – globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We therefore need global rules to make the financial sector a safe place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.92,0)">Countries which believe that they can secure national financial stability without global rules may actually endanger the financial sector – everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">So Sam Woods, head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, was quite right to say in his Mansion House speech last year: “The UK financial system must be robustly regulated and supervised whatever the outcome of the government’s negotiations with the European Union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The same is true for the European banks, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This approach makes for a safe and sound banking sector and should not change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Conclusion The euro area has grown closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The single currency has been complemented by a single banking supervisor and a single resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This was a major step towards safe and sound banks as well as towards a stronger economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">To be sure, the euro area faces some serious challenges, but I am convinced that they are better tackled jointly rather than individually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.4,0)">Still, the UK is charting a course away from the shores of Europe and into a vast and empty ocean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That makes me think of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.4,0)">It seems that many people in the UK indeed long for the endless immensity of the sea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">To them it stands for independence from the EU and for freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.37,0)">However, building a ship and sailing the seven seas still requires collecting wood and assigning tasks and work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.34,0)">These may seem to be small details, but in the real world, the devil is in the detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.44,0)">Today I have touched on some of the details that will affect the banks – and these are very intricate and difficult to handle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.87,0)">Now just imagine that there are many other sectors where Brexit will trigger equally complex issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The goal should be to find a workable solution that is in the interests of both the British people and the people of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">We all have an interest in strong banking supervision and mutual cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">And that is a strong foundation.</span>
