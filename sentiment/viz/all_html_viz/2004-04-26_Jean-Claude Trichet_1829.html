    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> Issues in monetary policy: views from the ECB Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet,President of the European Central Bank,delivered at the luncheon organised by the Economic Club of New York, New York, 26 April 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Mrs President, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends, It is a great honour and a pleasure to be invited to speak to the Economic Club of New York on the eve of a defining moment in Europe’s history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Only five years ago we engaged in a grand enterprise of institutional design that irreversibly tied together the economic and monetary destiny of eleven, then twelve, nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In five days from now, the European Union will complete its largest ever expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">What was originally a Community of six countries in Western Europe will become a Union of 25, spanning a geographic area that used to be divided by an iron curtain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today we can watch some 450 million Europeans dismantling the barbed wire of political hatred and economic seclusion that had split the continent for more than half a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">We can watch Europe, once again, engaging in a concerted effort to overcome differences and manage diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Taking issue with this historical transition, I intend to focus my remarks on the challenges of executing monetary policy in such a rapidly changing world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.71,0)">A world in which high-speed structural change – whether spurred by spontaneous economic forces or institutional evolution – may put time-tested economic models at risk, and defy policy-makers’ search for easy policy recipes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will describe the mechanisms that the ECB has set in place to protect itself against the risk of serious misperceptions and policy mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">My conjecture is that these mechanisms can explain a great deal of the reasons why the institutional transition in Europe has so far been accomplished in the smooth manner in which it proceeded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And I will argue that the same mechanisms are also appropriate to prepare Europe for the new challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.62,0)">Central banks and uncertainty The ECB, like all central banks, is faced with several dimensions of acute uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.44,0)">The economy is continuously hit by disturbances that are often difficult to identify in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.18,0)">Even when policy-makers are able to correctly assess the source and the nature of a disturbance affecting the economy, tracking its propagation profile and assessing its final impact on the key variables of interest to policymakers is a daunting task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Econometric theory has spent decades devising sophisticated tools to isolate different types of shocks from the tangle that appears in the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.65,0)">But inference is often non-robust across various identification schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And real-time identification remains central banks’ Holy Grail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.1,0)">As a consequence, central bankers are given little guidance by theory in their daily endeavour to filter out noisy data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.3,0)">The task of policy-makers is further complicated if they suspect that customary cyclical movements are compounded by an ongoing change in the deep structure of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">For one thing, structural change amplifies the identification problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.21,0)">It is difficult to ascertain whether the dynamic force that we see appearing on the screen is going to be reversed and eventually vanish, or will become ingrained in the underlying economic mechanism for many years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.07,0)">But more importantly, in case a structural change is truly under way, macroeconomic relationships derived from empirical regularities and historical averages are bound to lose significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A new set of relationships would need to be estimated and tested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.4,0)">But serious diagnostics for structural stability rarely give definitive answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.13,0)">And re-estimation requires sufficiently extended spans of data that simply do not yet exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.37,0)">Structural change on a global scale The past decade, on both sides of the Atlantic, has not been kind to policymakers’ aspiration to a comfortably stable set of structural relations usable for policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.82,0)">At a minimum, the second half of the 1990s and the early years of this century have sent us stark reminders that the economic structure does not hold still for long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Our recent experience in coping with economic change has provided more than one stress test of the macroeconomic models that are in use in our institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I shall mention three examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On this side of the Atlantic, the policy debate has primarily focused on technological innovation, the spread of information technology, and globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Many distinguished analysts have identified in the combination of these three dynamic factors the main structural force behind the reduction in economic frictions and the narrowing of the ability of any single market player to influence prices and dictate market conditions domestically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">This course of events has increased competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Through a better allocation of resources, heightened competition has advanced the standards of living in more than one country, notably the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.09,0)">However, the same phenomenon has also reduced policymakers’ confidence in what seemed to be well-tested economic relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">For example, it has loosened the association between output growth and inflation, and between these two variables and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.47,0)">And many US observers were left wondering whether the intense capital deepening of the last few years – and the associated measured growth in productivity – may have shifted substantially the relationship between output and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.31,0)">Of course, lasting shifts in productivity trends and their economic consequences, if real, will be clearly visible only in retrospect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.03,0)">Financial markets have also been a very important source of structural discontinuity with the past, in Europe and the US alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.42,0)">We all have witnessed the frantic rise and the subsequent shake-up of equity valuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In addition, we have seen an unprecedented wave of mergers and acquisitions, facilitated by deeper and more liquid financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.44,0)">This wave not only has affected domestic markets, but also very much has brought about tighter global linkages in the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.66,0)">These tighter linkages, in turn, may have affected the extent and pace of the transmission of economic developments across the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">Structural change in Europe Thirdly, let me mention some sources of structural change that are specific to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I would like to emphasise three dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">One is related to the institutional switch that the creation of the single currency has represented for the nations that have adopted the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.62,0)">It was not clear at the outset to what extent the introduction of the single currency would affect financial markets and price and wage-setting behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.04,0)">Indeed, times of institutional change are arguably times in which private expectations may fail to co-ordinate on a focal point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.02,0)">The widely-held presumption then was that the statistical patterns emerging from past data might not be informative of the structure of the new economic entity, and inference drawn on its basis might even be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.74,0)">Those were times in which the measure of uncertainty was closer to a ‘Knightian concept’ wherein probability distributions for model coefficients could not even be known or existant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The money market, for one, underwent a historical transformation on the eve of the launch of the Euro in January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Eleven national markets, so diverse in terms of participants, operating conventions, settlement structures, credit facilities, had to merge into a unified trading area almost overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">New payments systems for large-value transactions were implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Capital markets traditionally protected by currency fragmentation and national regulations were opened up to arbitrage and straight competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It could not be taken for granted that private agents could immediately form expectations consistent with the new regime, and thus instability in behaviour could not be ruled out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Let me also mention, en passant, that, although the process of preparing for the adoption of the single currency had been carefully crafted, much remained to be accomplished on the side of constructing homogenous statistics across the countries participating to the Euro area and the elaboration of tools and models for the analysis of economic data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The second dimension relates to ongoing efforts of the Euro area to implement structural reforms in the labour and good markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">These reforms aim to make these markets more flexible, strengthening the Euro area’s competitiveness and its resilience to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Several such reforms have been already implemented and many more are to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.57,0)">This is a factor that adds uncertainty to the stability of economic relationships in the Euro area, a factor that the central bank has to take into account when taking policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The third dimension of structural change in Europe is that associated with enlargement The integration of these new countries will affect the European economy through a change in trade patterns, capital and labour flows and a higher level of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The enlargement will no doubt provide new opportunities for trade and investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Some effects are already visible in a high degree of economic integration between the current Member States and the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Lower trade costs and an increase in competition associated with the enlargement of the Single Market can have a significantly positive impact on growth in the European economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.6,0)">But the side effect might be, again, a somewhat diminished ability to extrapolate statistical patterns seen in the past to forecast the future, at least for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">One notable source of dynamics in structural relationships, looking forward, will be the convergence across income and productivity levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">For acceding countries as a whole, per capita income today is less than half of the average of the Euro area, so the potential for trade creation and redirection of existing trade and production specialisation patterns is enormous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In the end, increasing prosperity and living standards will be forthcoming for the whole Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And along the way the drive towards reallocation of production and re-specialisation will call for changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy concept Europe’s transition to the single currency, no doubt, marked a time in which the signal extraction problem in understanding economic developments was most acute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.75,0)">Yet, the transition was smooth and the abrupt switch in the process by which agents form their expectations, that many observers had predicted, did not materialise after all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">So, amidst the challenges that loom in our future, we are reassured that we did make it and that it bears testimony to our capacity to weather difficulty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">On the eve of the Euro changeover, markets immediately recognised the new rules of the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">They adjusted swiftly to the new monetary policy environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Money market developments indicated that monetary policy was reasonably predictable from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Euro area medium and long-term inflation expectations, as measured by survey data, have remained around 1.8%-1.9%, consistently pointing to a high degree of credibility of the ECB’s official announcement that it would aim to maintain inflation below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In this respect, long-term inflation expectations aligned themselves with the low levels of the best performing economies that were merged into the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.33,0)">This is all the more remarkable given that the ECB started without a track record of its own and was faced with a number of sizeable, mainly upward, price shocks hitting the Euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Faced by an environment characterized by an exceptional measure of uncertainty, the ECB identified three principles for an efficient monetary governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These three principles, stability, comprehensiveness, and transparency have been incorporated in the monetary policy concept that has guided our course since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Stability There is, today, a general recognition that price stability is highly desirable from an economic standpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">It preserves an environment conducive to the optimization of resource allocation and therefore permits to foster sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">There are several other reasons why price stability is a public good of great value: In particular, preserving the purchasing power of the citizens, including the most vulnerable, and preserving the correct functioning of the democratic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In a world of accelerated changes, the concept of stability is even more of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The central bank has responsibility to be an anchor of stability, price stability being the ultimate goal and one of the preconditions for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This stability principle has two major corollaries: First, being as clear as possible as regards not only the goal, but also the arithmetic definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The Treaty establishing the Economic and Monetary Union wrote in stone that the objective assigned to the European Central Bank was price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In 1998, upon taking up its monetary policy tasks, the Governing Council of the ECB sharpened the focus by defining price stability in quantitative terms as the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">We further facilitated the coordination of private expectations by clarifying that in the pursuit of price stability the ECB aims at inflation rates below but close to 2%, thereby preserving a sufficient safety margin against the risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">This precise definition had not only the advantage of permitting to anchor inflation expectations and to enhance transparency and accountability of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">It was also absolutely instrumental in preserving continuity in the moment of transition from the previous national currencies to the Euro: the Euro was given the very same definition of price stability as the one attributed to the most credible national currencies benefiting from the lowest market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">That has contributed to one of the most remarkable – and unduly discrete – process of the setting up of the Euro: From day one the Euro was given the best yield curve available in the economies of the Euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Second, immunizing monetary policy against short-termism by solidly anchoring it on a medium-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.98,0)">Constantly bombarded by economic news, a central bank risks being swamped by the latest indicator and by its conjectures concerning markets’ likely reaction to the latest indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This mechanism can lead monetary policy gradually astray from its foremost role of providing a firm medium-term anchor for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">The ECB has built into its strategy a mechanism against short-termism by adopting a “keeping its composure” approach to countering shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Instrumental in this steady-hand framework is our notion that the appropriate horizon for monetary policy is the “medium term”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this respect, the time horizon over which price stability has to be re-established needs to be tailored to the circumstances prevailing in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.36,0)">Sometimes, notably if there is suspicion that asset prices are moving substantially up or down, it pays to look even very far ahead, beyond the average lag of monetary transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In other cases, the economy can be expected to return to price stability within a shorter horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.49,0)">Such horizon would depend on whether the shocks are temporary or permanent, whether they emerged on the supply or the demand side, on their domestic or external origin, their potential for becoming entrenched in pricing decisions and on their implications for the fragility of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In all events, the central bank has to preserve its credibility, ensuring that expectations remain consistent with its declared policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Comprehensiveness of the analytical framework A central bank, in its daily operations, has to filter an enormous amount of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It routinely seeks to define the state of the economy as new circumstances arise and evaluate their implications for the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.62,0)">As I tried to argue above, this is a highly demanding exercise, because shocks do not come about with labels and the economy is potentially always subjected to structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">As a consequence, it is clear for all central banks that no simple rules linking policy to one or two privileged indicators can substitute for an accurate examination of economic developments in all their decisions and forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">From the beginning, the ECB felt the need to endow itself with a conceptual framework that could help it sort through a wealth of conflicting statistics, and organize the various pieces into a reliable road map for internal analysis and communication with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This called for the adoption of a framework that concentrated more on picturing the economy as a large, complex and permanently evolving system, rather than trying to condense this complexity into too simple summary statistics and models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the event, we opted for a ‘binocular’ perspective over the economy, organised in an “economic analysis” and a “monetary analysis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This policy framework, which came to be known as the ‘two pillar approach’, permits to convey the notion of a diversified analysis and, in our view, ensures that no information is lost in the assessment of risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">An important rationale for the two-pillar approach relates to the difference in the time perspectives relevant for analysis of price developments and for the formation of private inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Empirical analysis has shown that the inflation process can be broadly decomposed into two components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.89,0)">One is associated with the interplay between demand and cost factors at a high frequency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.63,0)">The other is connected to more drawn-out and persistent trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The latter component demonstrates an empirical association with the trend growth of money on a long-term basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The short to medium-term “economic analysis” – with its focus on real activity and financial conditions – is well equipped to study shorter-run deviations of inflation from its long-term trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.07,0)">However, it often fails to track the mechanisms by which monetary factors act over extended horizons to nail down such trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.72,0)">As a consequence, a monetary policy framework exclusively centred on such analysis would leave a ‘loose end’ in the expectations formation process, to the extent that it would offer no anchor to anticipations of price developments as the horizon – over which these are formed – lengthens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There are, therefore, merits in cross-checking the indications for the monetary stance that emanate from the shorter-term “economic analysis” with those stemming from the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Monetary analysis constantly reminds the central bank of the fundamental principle that, while responding to economic developments as they unfold, it must never lose sight of the fact that, over sufficiently extended horizons, the rate of money growth must be consistent with its price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This cross-check ensures that monetary policy has a nominal anchor beyond – and even well beyond – the conventional projection horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">It also induces and reinforces a firm sense of direction, discouraging policy agitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Let me also observe that the success of the transition to the Euro was also very much depending on the lasting anchoring of long-term and even very long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As a matter of fact, to benefit at the very start of the Euro from the best yield curve available in the Euro area, to be able to extend immediately the very low market interest rates that existed only in a small number of economies to the full body of the Euro area, one needed to be very credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And this credibility in the delivery of price stability had to be intact not only in a two-year or five-year perspective, but also on a ten-year and thirty-year basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.74,0)">Despite the fact that the ECB had a precise definition of price stability which the Federal Reserve System had not, like the Fed the ECB deliberately chose not to mould its own monetary policy strategy as one of “inflation targeting.” To be sure, the concept of “inflation targeting” is not always a clearly defined concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.19,0)">However, if it is understood as a framework that makes macroeconomic forecasts the principal, if not the sole, statistical input feeding the policy-making process, then we would consider it too narrow a description of what monetary policy should look at.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, attempts to characterise the state of an economy in terms only of inflation forecasts would neither do justice to the intrinsic complexity of the decision-making process, nor would it provide a robust and safe approach to policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.4,0)">This is particularly true in a world of accelerated structural change in which central banks face a high degree of uncertainty about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">A central bank needs to maintain appropriate flexibility in the way it responds to shocks, taking decisions which are robust across a set of different plausible scenarios for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.06,0)">In this respect, it has been increasingly recognised that a central bank that focuses on inflation forecasts at one or two-year horizon would not be able to appropriately take into account the formation of financial imbalances, as they generally exert effects on price developments at longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Especially in the face of substantial uncertainty about the sustainability of asset-price developments, it may instead be advisable to set interest rates with a view to a time frame extending well beyond conventional forecast horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">More generally, the existence of uncertainty requires central banks to put strong emphasis on the robustness of their decisions, which implies that a good monetary policy strategy needs to perform as well as possible across a variety of empirically plausible models and scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And it is in particular our view that the complexity with which monetary policy-makers are faced with should be presented to the public in a transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Transparency Indeed, the third principle that we have adhered to since the inception the ECB is the importance of open and transparent communication with investors, savers, market participants and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This is a prerequisite for appropriate accountability and enhances the understanding among the markets of how the central bank conducts its monetary policy, thereby enhancing substantially policy effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.97,0)">This was especially important for a new institution such as the ECB which was lacking a track record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The announcement of our monetary policy strategy in October 1998, before the ECB actually started to be in charge of conducting the single monetary policy in the Euro area, was a key element in our striving for transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">It clearly stated the rules of the game and helped to reduce the uncertainty faced by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Communication with the public and the markets has also being facilitated by the fact that our assessment of the economic situation and the risks to price stability is regularly published and that monetary policy decisions are explained in the press conference that we give after each monthly meeting in which monetary policy is discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">The ECB produces on a monthly basis a bulletin that provides a detailed economic assessment to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.05,0)">We have been told from time to time that we were not sufficiently transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.67,0)">I think this is not justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">As a matter of fact, we have been very imaginative and creative in this respect at the very beginning of the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In 1999 the state of the art of central banking was to display the diagnosis of the Central Bank 5 or 6 weeks after the decision was taken in publishing the minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.23,0)">No explanation at all was given in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We have been the first Central Bank to publish a full, detailed, real time public display of our analysis and of the reasons why we had taken our decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And we have also been the first to embark on a press conference organised by the President and the Vice President to explain the decision of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In that sense, we are one of the most transparent Central Banks in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And we have contributed substantially to modify the state of the art of Central Banking: Today it would not be possible for a Central Bank to take a decision without displaying a real time explanation of the decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary policy and asset prices I have already alluded to some of the challenges that monetary policy must face in relation to asset-price movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Let me, therefore, at this stage pose on this issue that has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the debate among policy-makers, academics and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.05,0)">There are many challenges that central bankers face in relation to the links between monetary policy and asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.62,0)">To name a few: Should central banks react to asset-price movements?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">How to identify the insurgence of dis-equilibrium in asset prices when the equilibrium level is unknown?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.37,0)">How to avoid a moral hazard problem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">How to communicate with the public in case of asset-price bubbles?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.2,0)">Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to any of these questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.11,0)">Instead, faced by starkly competing models and conflicting explanations of virtually all financial phenomena, central banks are constantly reminded of the great value of robustness and pragmatism in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In this respect, I shall contend that the strategy adopted by the ECB involves some features which help to see through and tackle these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">First of all, the overriding objective of price stability, which monetary policy should be geared to, makes clear that asset prices cannot be a target for a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This follows from the notion that in the long run, asset prices – such as stock or real estate prices – are fundamentally determined by real factors such as productivity, the inter-temporal preferences of society, and demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.53,0)">A central bank cannot control these factors and therefore it cannot aim at bringing about any asset price configuration that is not rooted in such fundamental forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In addition, it is widely recognised that the central bank’s focus on the overriding objective of price stability helps to reduce investors’ misperceptions about future return possibilities and alleviates the problem of asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.86,0)">At the very least, even though price stability cannot guarantee financial stability in all circumstances, it is clear that the absence of price stability would only exacerbate the problems associated with asset-price misalignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Incidentally, as I have already mentioned, adopting a flexible medium-term orientation in the pursuit of price stability has the effect of lengthening the monetary policy horizon beyond the two years within which meaningful inflation forecasts are usually constructed, depending on the prevailing economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This lengthening of the policy horizon helps to trace out the likely macroeconomic impact of a putative financial misalignment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Although asset prices cannot be a target for monetary policy, they no doubt reveal very useful information about future risks to price stability that a central bank should take in due consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">It is important to recognise, however, that a rise in asset prices does not always signal increased inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.59,0)">Whether or not this is the case very much depends on the underlying shock to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.21,0)">There is thus no easy way to shortcut the signal extraction problem faced by a central bank in the financial markets and the design of an appropriate monetary policy reaction to a given movement in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Instead, a careful identification of the shocks driving the markets to best evaluate their implications for the risks to future price stability is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.2,0)">Movements in asset prices that astray from their fundamental value, so-called asset-price bubbles, pose specific and additional challenges for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The first – and already very big – challenge is to detect in real time whether a bubble is developing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.06,0)">Asset prices are inherently forward looking and it is very difficult to assess ex ante whether the expectations underlying an ascending or descending trend are realistic or are just validating themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.84,0)">In this respect, the central bank typically has no better knowledge about future fundamentals than the market itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.27,0)">This does not mean that a central bank is left all by itself in the face of major asset price movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For example, some simple measures for identifying overly optimistic expectations in the valuation of stocks seem to have been reliable indicators on quite a few occasions in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Moreover, apart from significant deviations of asset prices from past trends or from model-based predictions, it appears that it is also useful to look at developments in credit and monetary variables in order to identify bubble phenomena in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">In this respect, we have gathered some evidence that growth rates of money and credit which are persistently in excess of those needed to sustain economic growth at non-inflationary levels may, under certain circumstances, provide early information on emerging financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Incidentally, this is another important argument for devoting systematic attention in our analysis to the monitoring of money and credit developments in our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Finally, careful analysis of the balance sheets of the different sectors of the economy may also be able to provide early signals regarding the formation of bubble phenomena and financial imbalances in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.37,0)">But despite all this, it is clear that the difficulties involved in identifying asset-price misalignments in real time are enormous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Central banks need to be very cautious in forming their assessments and keep the caveats underlying their analyses always in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And the challenges faced by central banks in the face of sustained market movements are not exhausted by the identification problem that I just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.99,0)">Even in the rare cases in which the central bank can confidently claim to be facing an unusual and possibly destabilising asset price movement, the design of its reaction is all but automatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.25,0)">It is often argued that a central bank in such circumstances should carefully tighten its monetary policy at an early stage in order to suppress the bubble process before it escalates to disproportionate dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">If a bubble exists, a somewhat tighter policy along the build-up phase – so the argument goes – may help to avoid that even larger imbalances may develop down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">However, a bold opposite view has also found some supporters among economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.81,0)">This alternative policy option would tend to suggest that, due to the rather long lags in the operation of monetary policy impulses, the central bank should consider loosening – rather than tightening – its policy in anticipation of the bubble collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This would cushion the negative effects of the expected economic downturn in a forward-looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.62,0)">There is a very strong argument against this policy option because, when a bubble process emerges, it is then almost impossible for the central bank to predict the timing of the turnaround in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.53,0)">And if the central bank cannot be sure that the bubble will burst of its own accord, a loosening of policy will further strengthen the bubble process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.5,0)">But the dilemma – where not only the measure of misalignments, but also the sign of the monetary policy response to it is somewhat controversial – exemplifies the amplitude of the policy dilemma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If and when the bubble bursts, there is a dimension of strategic interaction that a prudent policymaker cannot ignore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This offers a rather strong argument in favour of symmetry in the central bank’s behaviour in boom and bust periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.89,0)">If a central bank were to react in an asymmetric manner, namely only with looser policy at times of asset price busts but not with tighter policy when asset price bubbles emerge, the central bank may create through its own behaviour a moral hazard problem among market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">It is crucial for a central bank to avoid this, since a perception that it insures investors against the risk of large losses could easily contribute to the formation of new bubbles in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All these considerations underscore how delicate is the issue of how to best communicate with the public during episodes of sustained asset-price movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The principle of transparency in the conduct of monetary policy would demand that if the central bank’s view about the bubble enters into its monetary policy considerations it should make its views known to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Two central banks in comparison In conclusion, let me wrap up my remarks in a comparative mode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me explain how I see our European monetary policy concept in comparison with the US Federal Reserve monetary policy concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will not dwell on what is from time to time presented as the major difference, namely the legal objective assigned to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I already said that in my analysis this difference is one of presentation more than of substance, and should not be overdone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Instead, I would stress that I see two major similarities and two significant differences between the ECB and the Federal Reserve concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Two similarities: First, both the ECB and the Fed are putting a strong emphasis on transparency of the decision making process, on transparency of the analysis that is worked out by the responsible decision-making college, on explanations of the economic diagnosis to the public opinion and market participants, and on accountability vis-à-vis the Parliament of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We both explain in real time why we took our decision  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We both go frequently before the Parliament of the Union to explain our policy and to respond to all questions of members of Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, both the ECB and the Fed are clear on being as comprehensive as possible in their analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB and the Fed incorporate in their analysis all possible pertinent information, all relevant forecasts and modelling exercises, including private sector views, whether economic or monetary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.75,0)">Neither the Fed nor the ECB are dependent for their decisions on the mechanical result of an equation, or of a system of equations, or on an algorithm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In a very complex world, where the complexity of reality cannot be adequately captured by any single modelling and where uncertainty – including what I referred to as ‘Knightian uncertainty’, that is a type of uncertainty without having the possibility to refer to a probability distribution – is an important element to take into account in any decision, we both trust we need all pertinent information, modelling and forecasts and judgement enlightened by the collegial wisdom and experience of a Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.77,0)">We have also two significant differences that should also be stressed and explain why, despite our strong similarities, observers are very often underlining that we are illustrating different concepts of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, we made public our precise quantitative definition of price stability whereas the Fed does not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Fed probably has good reasons not to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Perhaps it implicitly refers to what the public opinion at large would regard as price stability in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.54,0)">I do not judge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Let me only point out the advantages of the ECB position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is good for transparency: everybody knows precisely what we are aiming at.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is good for accountability: the public opinion can judge whether or how we are achieving our own goals in comparison with the yardstick we made public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It is good for medium and long-term credibility: inflationary expectations can be more easily anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Let me also recall that the success of the transition to the Euro five years ago demanded as much clarity as possible as regards our definition of price stability in comparison with previous national definitions of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">We had promised that the new currency would be at least as good as the previous national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This promise meant that the new currency would be at least as credible as the most credible of the previous national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It also meant that the market interest rates associated with the new currency would be as low as the interest rates associated with the most credible currencies and the definition of price stability would not be looser.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Had this not been the case, then markets would have demanded a risk premium to take into account the looser definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And the transition could not have been organised in such a way as for the Euro to reap the full legacy of the lowest yield curve available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">So it is not only for strong theoretical reasons but also due to practical considerations of an extremely important nature that the ECB has chosen to give a quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second difference with the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As I tried to explain previously, we have assessed that it was useful to incorporate visibly in our monetary policy concept a monetary analysis complementing the economic analysis and permitting a cross-check of the latter from a medium to long-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We have seen three advantages in setting up our twofold approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Firstly, to reflect that inflation, as a last resort, and in a medium to long-term basis, is a monetary phenomenon; this notion is, by the way, very widely recognised by central bankers and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.98,0)">Secondly, to help taking some account in our monetary policy of the issue of avoiding abnormal boom-bust episodes in asset prices, which could be fed by abnormal abundance or drying up of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">And thirdly, perhaps the most important reason by far, to contribute to better anchoring medium to long-term inflationary expectations, which is important for all central banks of the world and all the more important for the ECB which cannot rely, for that purpose, on long-term past records.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Also for this second difference with the Fed concept, there are, in my eyes, both solid theoretical reasons and practical considerations associated with the transition to the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">All taken into account, it seems to me that what is uniting us, our similarities, are more important than our differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">And we have solid explanations for our differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.16,0)">I understand, in particular, that trends in money demand have not been as stable in the US as they have been in the Euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.94,0)">This may partly explains the differences in our approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">Overall, there is no simple escape for a central bank from a rigorous analysis of the shocks hitting the economy and the underlying changes affecting the economic structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.69,0)">A central bank can never simply steer monetary policy as the result of a calculation, the final stage of an algorithm or the functioning of a mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Similarly to the Federal Reserve System, we believe that in the assessment of a financial and economic environment that is on an accelerated rapid course, the central bank needs realism and pragmatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Policy decisions must be based, ultimately, on a judgement and must be clearly explained to the public in a transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">From its inception the ECB has striven to score highly on each of these dimensions and will continue to do so in face of the challenges that are waiting us ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
