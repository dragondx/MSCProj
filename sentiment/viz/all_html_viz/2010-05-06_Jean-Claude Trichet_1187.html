    <span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)"> “What role for finance?” University lecture by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, 6 May 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank Universidade Nova very warmly for the kind invitation and the opportunity to deliver a lecture here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I have chosen the title “What role for finance?” because the past three years have taught us how important it is to reflect on this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">And I have chosen it for a university lecture because I believe that university researchers – and the young people they educate – will make a vital contribution to re-thinking the role of finance in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finance touches virtually every sphere of human endeavour – from individuals and households to corporations and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.58,0)">But the crisis has posed a provocative question to which many people would like an answer: why and to what extent does society need finance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.09,0)">In recent economic history, the answer has always been dependent on circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In times of affluence, when finance makes lenders and borrowers alike rich and respected, the answer is resoundingly positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.91,0)">In contrast, in times of economic regress, disillusionment with markets suggests to an embittered public that financiers of all kinds are the same as short-term speculators motivated by greed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will try to bring a timeless perspective to these vacillating public attitudes towards finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To anticipate my line of reasoning, I think that – at a minimum – the crisis has belied the long-standing conviction in macroeconomics, that “ where enterprise leads, finance follows”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.82,0)">Contrary to Joan Robinson’s 1952 dictum, I think that financial structures are part of the deep texture of an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They are relevant for trend growth and for shaping the business cycle around the trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Here, I side more with Joseph Schumpeter, who in 1934 wrote: “He   stands between those who wish to form new combinations and the possessors of productive means… He is the ephor   of the exchange economy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">At the same time, and again in contrast to Joan Robinson’s view of “finance as a veil”, I see financial structures as a prime source of aggregate uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.88,0)">The economic relevance of shocks that originate in the markets for lending and borrowing is incalculable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.5,0)">It cannot be measured in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">It is difficult to quantify even in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.11,0)">But we all know that it is large, and that no society can afford to let finance sever its ties to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Yet, over the past two decades, financial players have gradually expanded their activities beyond Schumpeter’s idea of intermediation between savers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)">The financial sector has gradually and quietly decoupled – at least in part – from the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Financial innovations and the trading book are increasingly seen as a more profitable business line than extending loans to businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">Credit default swaps, asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations are the most illustrative examples of this change of focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my remarks today I will discuss this quiet shift in the paradigm of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will explore how finance creates economic value, and why – at times – it can do more harm than good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">I will conclude by proposing a way forward – a way that discourages business models oriented to the short term, that promotes healthy financial innovation and that ensures long-term financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Allen, F. and D.
