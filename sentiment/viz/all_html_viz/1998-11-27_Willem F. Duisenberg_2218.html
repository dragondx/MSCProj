    <span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)"> Keynote address on The European System of Central Banks, Current position and future prospects to be delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank at a Conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs on European economic and Monetary Union "Markets and Politics under the Euro", London 27 november 1998 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation at being invited to deliver a speech at this conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is a great pleasure for me to be here, in London, today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The topic I am going to address relates to the current position and the future prospects of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">I feel that this topic provides me with an opportunity to deal with the objective of the ESCB and its contribution to the other policies in the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I will also briefly touch upon the decision-making in the ESCB, recall the main features of our monetary policy strategy and talk about our regard for openness and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The final part of my talk will cover the views of the ESCB on recent economic developments and the future outlook for price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Independence, transparency and accountability In the Maastricht Treaty the ESCB has been given an independent status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.79,0)">The reason is that politicians all over the world have come round to the view that monetary policy decisions taken with too close a political involvement tend to take too short a time horizon into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.43,0)">The consequence is that in the longer term such decisions do not support sustainable gains in employment and income, but only lead to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This view is confirmed by a host of economic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Independence, however, requires a clear mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ESCB has such a mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Its primary objective is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Without prejudice to the objective of price stability the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Price stability is not an end in itself: it creates the conditions in which other, higher-order, objectives can be reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.03,0)">In particular, I share the deep concerns about the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The ESCB will do what it can to contribute to the solution of this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">By maintaining price stability inflation expectations and interest rates can be kept at a low level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This creates a stability-oriented environment which fosters sustainable growth, a high level of employment, a fair society and better living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Moreover, in specific circumstances, if production, inflation and employment all move in the same direction, monetary policy can play some role in stabilising output and employment growth without endangering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, the contribution from monetary policy can generally be only limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Given the structural nature of the unemployment problems the solution is to be found, above all, in structural reforms aimed at well-functioning labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An independent central bank does not only need a clear mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It has also to be an open and transparent institution, for at least three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">First, transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy by creating the correct expectations on the part of economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">A predictable monetary policy contributes to achieving stable prices without significant adjustment costs and with the lowest interest rate possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.96,0)">The second reason is that in a democratic society the central bank has to account for its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Finally, transparency towards the outside world can also structure and discipline the internal debate inside the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me now turn to the ways and means of achieving transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As a first element the ESCB has defined a quantitative objective for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It reads as follows: price stability is a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.84,0)">Although I do not consider deflation to be likely in the current environment, I may add that a situation of falling prices would not be consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The Governing Council has made it clear that "Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.95,0)">The ESCB cannot be held accountable for short-run deviations from price stability, for example due to shocks in import prices or specific fiscal measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.27,0)">A monetary policy reaction to short-run fluctuations in the price level would provide the wrong signals to the market and cause unnecessary interest rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In summary, the ESCB will react in an appropriate, measured and, when necessary, gradualist manner to economic disturbances that threaten price stability in the medium term, rather than in an abrupt way, in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions of the process of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">That said, the ESCB will, whenever necessary, openly discuss and explain the sources of possible deviations from the quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In addition, let me remind you that by focusing on the HICP for the euro area, the ESCB makes it clear that it will base its decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The single monetary policy has to take a euro area-wide perspective: it will not react to specific regional or national developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The institutional implication is that the ESCB should develop into a strong unity, with a strong centre and strong national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">It should become a truly European institution, with a truly European outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Of course, it may take some time to arrive where we ultimately want to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We have to get used to thinking in euro area-wide terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In the ECB Governing Council we are already "practising" that approach and are making progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">I am confident that the ESCB will indeed act as a unity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Transparency and openness will be apparent from the way in which the ESCB communicates with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.23,0)">The ESCB will regularly present its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and provide information about each specific monetary policy decision, be it a move in interest rates or an absence of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This will notably be done by way of press releases, press conferences, publications and speeches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.2,0)">Press releases are made available immediately after the fortnightly meetings of the Governing Council and, as you may know, they always include a precise list of the decisions taken together with background information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There will be a monthly press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such a press conference will start with a detailed introductory statement, as has been the case so far, and these introductory statements will also be published immediately, without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this statement the Vice-President and I will present the Governing Council's view of the economic situation and the underlying arguments for its monetary policy decisions, followed by a question and answer session.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">The publications of the ESCB will include, in particular, an ECB Bulletin each month as well as an Annual Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As from 1999, a detailed analysis of the economic situation in the euro area will be presented in the monthly Bulletin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Thematic articles in this Bulletin will include in-depth analyses by the ECB on matters regarding the monetary policy of the ESCB and the economy of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Further, you may also recall that, as required by its Statute, the ESCB will publish its consolidated balance sheet on a weekly basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">My colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and I intend to be very active in giving speeches dealing with all issues of relevance for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I am convinced that the Governors of the national central banks will also play their role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Since I am talking about the communication and external relations of the ESCB, I would like to underline that I am prepared to accept invitations to appear before the European Parliament at least four times a year to present the activities of the ESCB and the ECB's Annual Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Finally, it should be noted that the ESCB will have a regular exchange of information and views with the ECOFIN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Representatives of the ECB will be invited to ECOFIN meetings whenever issues of concern to monetary policy are discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A similar relationship will naturally also exist with the EURO-11, whose meetings will generally be attended by the President of the ECB, whenever matters relevant to the ESCB are on the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Monetary policy strategy of the ESCB We are now approaching the start of the Third Stage of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The decision-making bodies of the ECB have made a certain number of important decisions since the ESCB was established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As part of these decisions, the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB was recently announced and explained to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The selected stability-oriented strategy promotes as much continuity as possible with the existing strategies of national central banks in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, its design is adapted to the unique situation of introducing a single currency in eleven countries, which may to a certain extent change economic behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Therefore as much continuity as possible and as much change as required is the thrust of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Our strategy consists of two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The first is an important role for money and the second is a broad-based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The main reason for assigning a prominent role to money is the empirically well-founded view that inflation, at least in the long run, is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This simple and obvious observation led the Governing Council to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad measure of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This choice will create a "nominal anchor" for monetary policy and therefore help stabilise private inflation expectations at longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The reference value will be derived in a manner that is clearly consistent with - and serves the achievement of - price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.07,0)">It will be constructed such that, in the absence of special factors or other distortions, deviations of monetary growth from the reference value will signal risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">However, it has to be clear that the reference value is different from an intermediate monetary target, as the ESCB has not made any commitment to correct deviations of actual monetary growth from the reference value over the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In particular, it has been realistically recognised that the move to a single currency and ongoing financial innovations may generate fluctuations in the selected monetary aggregate which are not necessarily associated with inflationary or deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.38,0)">For this reason, it is important to continuously monitor the relevance of temporary factors or even structural changes in order to avoid a mechanistic policy reaction to deviations of the chosen monetary aggregate from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The results of this analysis and its impact on the ESCB's monetary policy decisions will be explained to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me turn now to the second key element of the monetary policy strategy, the broad-based assessment of the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">The information contained in monetary aggregates, while of the utmost importance, will by no means constitute the whole of the "information set" in the hands of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In parallel with the analysis of money growth, a wide range of economic and financial variables will be used to formulate an assessment of the outlook for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The envisaged strategy will enable the ESCB to perform a cross-check between the information coming from the evolution of monetary aggregates and those from other economic and financial indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Recent economic developments and prospects Let me turn to the current economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area experienced a strengthening of economic growth in 1997, to 2.5%, and a further acceleration has been anticipated for this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.42,0)">The global environment has, of course, deteriorated in the meantime, but this has not so far had an observable impact on growth which has, in any event, been increasingly led by domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.08,0)">Inflation has remained subdued and even fallen somewhat over the past year, partly as a result of the impact of weaker global demand on oil and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">However, the favourable pattern of inflation has also been supported by domestic factors, such as a very moderate development in unit labour costs and industrial producer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.82,0)">Concerning recent price developments, HICP inflation for the euro area fell to 1.0% in September, due to a strong impact from food prices, but I would not want to read too much into this latest decline as some price components can be relatively volatile over short periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">More significantly, preliminary data suggest that various broad monetary aggregates for the euro area are increasing at between 3 and 5%, and thus do not appear to signal any strong incipient inflationary or deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We are in line with the consensus view that inflation in the euro area will rise moderately in 1999, but remain below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.04,0)">I do not consider deflation to be a serious risk for price stability at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">So far, despite the worsening of the global environment, euro area-wide activity has continued to expand at a fairly stable rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">At around 3%, annual real GDP growth was broadly unchanged in the first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.01,0)">Industrial production growth has slowed somewhat since the spring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">More recent evidence, particularly that of the area-wide survey data, may also suggest a moderation in the pace of growth and further developments in these indicators will continue to be monitored closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Area-wide growth should, however, be supported by a number of domestic factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">One factor supporting continued growth, particularly in private consumption, is the gradual improvement in labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.03,0)">Moreover, the lowest short-term interest rates in the euro area currently stand at 3.3%, and several countries have cut interest rates towards this level recently as part of the process towards interest rate convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.69,0)">The process of convergence towards this level has been gradual, but should imply a reduction in the average short-term interest rate in the euro area of about 0.5 percentage point since July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.67,0)">Long-term rates also stand at low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And, there has been a marked degree of exchange rate stability among countries participating in the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This is undoubtedly a welcome development from the standpoint of encouraging trade and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.25,0)">Thus, our assessment is similar to that of other international organisations, that - unless the international environment deteriorates further, which is not currently expected - growth will be somewhat weaker in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Growth should, however, remain high enough to support continued employment creation and, assuming a recovery in the international environment, there should be a pick-up in growth in the year 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the meetings in December the ECB Governing Council will again assess the outlook for economic and price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Although the economic outlook may be less favourable than expected - let us say - half a year ago, I believe that the conditions for a successful launch of the euro are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">You can be sure that the ESCB will do its utmost to make the euro a stable currency.</span>
