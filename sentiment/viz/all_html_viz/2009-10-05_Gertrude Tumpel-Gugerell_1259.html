    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> Recent advances in modelling systemic risk using network analysis Introductory remarks by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBECB workshop5 October 2009 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to the workshop on “Recent advances in modelling systemic risk using network analysis” here at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.24,0)">A workshop on systemic risk that provides an analytical focus on the financial sector as a network of financial agents could not come at a more timely moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)">In 1896 the German sociologist Georg Simmel stated in his book “The Philosophy of Money”: “money is the spider that spins society’s web”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With this, Simmel already at the time pointed to the network aspect of money, how financial innovation can transform the economy and society; and the transformation process as changes in the complexity, size and nature of economic and societal networks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The recent financial crisis has strikingly illustrated the interconnectedness that characterises the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In providing a framework for strengthening financial stability, policy-makers are currently not only refining the regulatory and institutional set-up, but also looking for new analytical tools that help to better identify, monitor and address sources of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Therefore, I believe network analysis can make a relevant contribution and I am delighted that you have come together today to present and discuss new work in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me give you three questions   which today’s workshop would ideally shed light on: What are the key channels and systemically important players that need special attention?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How can macro-prudential supervision take the interconnectedness into account?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">And can network methodologies provide us with a useful tool in this respect?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">With these questions in mind, I have structured my introductory remarks into three parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will first give a short assessment of the relevance of systemic risk in the modern financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Then I will discuss the use of network theories for the analysis of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Finally, I will briefly refer to network applications to payment and financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.39,0)">Systemic risk in the modern financial system Systemic risk refers to the possibility that a triggering event such as a bank failure or a market disruption could cause widespread disruption of the financial system, including significant difficulties in otherwise viable institutions or markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.73,0)">Preventing these negative externalities from impairing the functioning of the system and from spilling over to the real economy is a crucial element of the mission of central banks and of supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.38,0)">In the last two years, the functioning of the global financial system has been challenged by an extraordinary sequence of such triggering events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.04,0)">This brought to the fore how complex and interconnected the financial system had become and, consequently, how problems in one part of the system could reach other parts, also very distant ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.89,0)">In July and August 2007 the asset-backed commercial paper   market collapsed when investors realised that money market mutual funds had invested in paper backed by sub-prime assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.32,0)">Investors became suddenly distrustful of all forms of private credit, especially structured products and other complex and opaque instruments, and this caused the funding for structured investment vehicles and special-purpose vehicles to dry up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.02,0)">Difficulties faced by conduits and other asset-backed programmes in rolling over their short-term funding forced them to look to bank sponsors for liquidity   or to sell assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.66,0)">A crisis of confidence ensued which gripped money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market, notwithstanding their distance from the US housing market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.32,0)">Such unstable dynamics, set off by increasing uncertainty about the size of losses in the system and, maybe more importantly, about their exact location, continued in the course of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.42,0)">Then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 transformed a pessimistic and disoriented mood into full-blown panic and paralysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.17,0)">The biggest negative surprise following Lehman Brothers’ default was its effect on money market funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.74,0)">When one fund, Reserve Primary, “broke the buck”  , the sector was hit by a wave of redemptions that fuelled instability in the credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.74,0)">Again, banks and companies relying on short-term funding through commercial paper or ABCP   could not roll over their debt, except at overnight maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.76,0)">The ensuing dynamics in market participants’ behaviour clearly illustrate the presence of knock-on effects, negative externalities, and a coordination failure in the market network.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Each institution responded rationally given individually available information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.3,0)">However, each rational response had repercussions for the whole system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The impact of systemic risk depends very much on the collective behaviour of financial institutions and their interconnectedness, as well as on the interaction between financial markets and the macroeconomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Systemic stability is a public good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The recognition of this public good property underpins the recent emphasis on a macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">From a micro-prudential perspective, a strengthened supervision of individual institutions’ risk-taking incentives is also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A key element of the risk management framework of banks is that they take into account, in terms of credit and liquidity risks, the exposure they have to particular   counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.47,0)">Systemic risk is, generally, outside the control of each individual institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But, by keeping liquidity buffers and capital reserves and by limiting large exposures and addressing dependencies, banks can contribute to an increase in the resilience of the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The use of network theories for the analysis of systemic risk The financial crisis has reminded us how important it is to look at the links and connections of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.45,0)">We saw that major disruptions such as failure or a near failure of certain institutions rapidly spilled over to the whole financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Therefore, network theory can help us to analyze the systemic risk of such disruptions   by looking at how resilient the system is to contagion; and   what the major triggers and channels of contagion are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.59,0)">An important aspect of the analysis of systemic risk is that an apparently robust system may in fact be very fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This comes from the fact that a high number of interconnections within the network will serve as shock-amplifiers rather than as absorbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another key aspect of the analysis is that within the network of the financial system, there are players with only a few connections, but also players that are highly connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.18,0)">Obviously, such networks are extremely vulnerable if those highly connected players are disrupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.9,0)">In fact, when a shock hits the system, the number of affected players can be especially low, but still propagate system-wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.45,0)">Payment systems, for instance, are networks with such a property.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Clearly, large and highly connected financial institutions are systemically important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This has important implications for macro-prudential surveillance, and hence for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Network analysis is crucial for the identification of such systemically important institutions and markets which are critical market players in the web of exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monoline insurance providers and AIG provided an example of such critical players; key custodian banks or large correspondent banks play a similar role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.65,0)">Let me add to this, that a particular institution might not only be critical to the functioning of financial markets or market infrastructures because other institutions are financially exposed to it, but also because other market participants rely on the continued provision of its services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">For us as policymakers this is a crucial point, as the impact of a failure of a given market player also hinges on the ability of the financial infrastructure to support its resolution and to facilitate the orderly unwinding of positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So let me now turn to the specific application of network theory to payment and financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.68,0)">Network analysis applications to payment and financial systems Research in network theory has received relatively little attention in economics until the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Therefore, I am delighted to see that this literature is growing and today’s workshop clearly illustrates its growing importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The papers from today’s program highlight how direct and indirect interlinkages and contagion dynamics among financial institutions, as well as among institutions, markets and infrastructures, can be significantly influenced by three important network characteristics: First, the degree of connectivity, second, the degree of concentration and third, the size of exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We see from the papers that network analysis can help to better understand the interlinkages and systemic connections in many different segments of the financial markets, ranging from money markets to networks of credit default swaps  , and from large-value payment systems to cross-sector exposures in the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We see that this research gives important insights into the various amplification mechanisms in the global web of financial connections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Such amplification very much depends on a number of factors, such as the size of aggregate macroeconomic shocks, asset price volatility, liquidity risk and financial leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Moreover, network analysis can be used to simulate the effect of credit and funding shocks on banking and financial stability by taking into account – beyond the direct balance sheet exposures – also the impact of contingent claims and credit risk transfer techniques.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">I am glad that the workshop brings together a wide variety of applications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It demonstrates two key points: first, network analysis is advancing as a common tool for assessing dynamics within the various parts of the financial sector  ; and second, it reveals that a truly systemic perspective needs to combine the focus on various parts of the financial sector with an analysis of the interlinkages among them, ideally including the interaction with the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This is, of course, an ambitious objective that calls for further research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The recent financial crisis has underscored the need for policy-makers and regulators worldwide to track systemic linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Network analysis offers a very relevant tool for addressing this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Its focus on interconnectedness and on systemically important market players makes it especially relevant for the assessment of the fragility or resilience of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">By applying network theories we can benefit from the important progress made in other sciences to monitor and assess systemic risks, direct and indirect linkages, vulnerabilities and contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is because networks allow us to look beyond the immediate “point of impact” of a shock, hence, also to the spillovers likely to arise from interlinkages in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Thus, network analysis can undoubtedly provide useful guidance for the analysis of systemic risk and can be a key tool for the future analysis of such risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">For us, such analysis will be of crucial importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As you know a European Systemic Risk Board will be established with the mandate to map financial risks and their concentration at the system level for the macro-prudential supervision of systemic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The mandates of other supranational institutions and fora, such as the IMF and the Financial Stability Board, also refer to network aspects of the financial system that have become apparent during the current crisis and that should be taken into account in order to obtain new measures of financial fragility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Also for the specific field of market infrastructures the relevance of network effects are being taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.76,0)">The market for credit default swaps   has clearly revealed its systemic importance, as the default of one major counterparty has put the whole system under severe strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Therefore, I welcome very much that central counterparties for credit default swaps have been established to address first, the high degree of interconnectivity between CDS markets and credit and cash securities markets, second, the high leverage embedded in these financial instruments, and third, the significant concentration of related risks in a small group of major market players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Effective implementation of central clearing of derivatives enables a significant reduction in counterparty risk, hence addressing some of the negative externalities that stem from the over-the-counter network that has formed over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Interlinkages within the financial system are nothing fundamentally new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.38,0)">However, business strategies developed by financial institutions over the last 20 years and financial innovations have made the system much more interconnected, complex and opaque than it was in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I believe that policy-makers and regulators of today will be judged in the future on the basis of the regulatory measures and analytical tools they have applied to address the root causes of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">A key challenge is to transcend a purely national or sector-specific perspective and to take an approach that matches the global nature of financial networks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">A key prerequisite for network analysis as a surveillance tool remains, however, the availability of relevant data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This holds true especially on a cross-border basis, but also at bank level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Going forward, regulators and overseers should continue to develop ways to systematically collect and analyse data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The crisis has clearly demonstrated that data confidentiality must not stand in the way of improvements in systemic risk analysis and assessment by policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Once more, I welcome you to this workshop and I wish you productive and enriching discussions on this very relevant
