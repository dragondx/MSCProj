    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.57,0)"> Banking regulation and supervision – you can't have one without the other Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, 9th Annual EFR Stakeholder Round Table on "Financial Fragmentation or Integration", Brussels, 22 March 2018 The financial crisis showed what can happen when banks are not safe and sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">So the goal is to make banks safe and sound, and avoid future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">To that end, we have revamped regulation, and we have strengthened supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It’s indeed vital to work on both fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.42,0)">Without supervisors, rules would have little effect; without rules, supervisors would have no job – or at least no firm basis for doing their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">You can’t have one without the other: regulation and supervision need to be aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us take a look at the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In 2014, banking supervision was transferred from national to European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">And since then, we’ve achieved a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, we could do more, and that brings me to regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.99,0)">How European is regulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Well, it’s true, of course, that there is a single rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.79,0)">But by and large, regulation in Europe remains fragmented to a degree that makes it hard to reap the full benefits of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.84,0)">And the problem starts with the scope of that supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.91,0)">Large investment firms and third-country branches are still not covered by it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This situation should be changed to restrict regulatory and supervisory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">Then there are the options and national discretions contained in European regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.51,0)">Some of them are still exercised differently across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It’s up to legislators to harmonise them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The same is true for fit and proper assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The rules here are also very diverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And finally there are the tools for crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.21,0)">We still have no common approach to such things as insolvency laws and moratoriums.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.64,0)">This too needs to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Likewise, the rules for early intervention measures need to be streamlined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">All this begs the question: is the banking union living up to its full potential?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.45,0)">I would say: it’s not, at least not yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">But it could if the rules were further harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Now let’s turn to the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">With Basel III finalised, we have a global set of regulatory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.25,0)">As standards, they are not always detailed and they are not binding, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.77,0)">So they still need to be transposed into hard law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And this is crucial; the banking sector is global in scope, and the rules that govern it need to reflect that – at least so far as the big banks are concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">But as I said just now, rules can only work together with supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.65,0)">How effective global rules are also depends on how supervisors apply them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Supervisors must faithfully apply the rules which transpose the Basel standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To do so, they need adequate resources and they must be shielded from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And there’s more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">There is also a strong case for supervisors from around the world to exchange information, to cooperate and to coordinate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This would help to facilitate strong and effective banking supervision worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">We have done a lot to make banks safer and sounder, both at European and global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">The important thing is that we keep working together – within Europe and around the world.</span>
