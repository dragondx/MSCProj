    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)"> Introductory remarks at the EP’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, 17 November 2014 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be back again in this committee for the last hearing of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This year has once again been a year of profound change for the euro area and for the Union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It was a year of legislative and institutional progress on many fronts, as 2014 saw the birth of banking union with the agreement of the Single Resolution Mechanism, the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the successful conclusion of the comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.63,0)">And it was indeed a challenging year for monetary policy, which saw the ECB take a wide range of measures to respond to the risks emanating from an increasingly sobering economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">You have chosen two topics for today’s hearing, the relationship of financial fragmentation and monetary policy as well as the Eurosystem’s collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I will touch on both these issues, but let me first run you through our current assessment of the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.18,0)">Economic and monetary developments The euro area growth momentum has weakened over the summer months and most recent forecasts have been revised downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">At the same time, our expectation for a moderate recovery in 2015 and 2016 remains in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Demand should be supported by a number of factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Among them are our monetary policy measures and progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.62,0)">At the same time, high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the still ongoing and necessary balance sheet adjustments are likely to dampen the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.1,0)">Risks to the economic outlook continue to be on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.95,0)">In particular, the weakening in the euro area’s growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.18,0)">In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.33,0)">Inflation in the euro area remains very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.87,0)">In October, it stood at 0.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We expect it to remain at around current low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Looking forward, we closely monitor risks to price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.98,0)">The latest monetary data point to subdued underlying growth in broad money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Its annual growth rate has increased moderately over recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It appears that the turning point in credit growth is now behind us, and credit growth rates, while remaining negative, are gradually improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy and financial fragmentation Let me turn to financial fragmentation, the first topic you suggested for today’s hearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.86,0)">Fragmentation in various segments of the financial market has been a major obstacle to the smooth conduct and transmission of monetary policy, and ultimately to our ability to deliver on our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.71,0)">Also owing to determined actions the ECB has taken, fragmentation has receded significantly since the height of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Unsecured money market rates are trading again at reasonable spreads over their secured counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">Sovereign bond spreads in the euro area decreased significantly from their peaks in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Together, these developments reflect the gradual return of confidence among investors in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.03,0)">Yet, we still face a situation where our very accommodative monetary policy stance does not sufficiently reach some final borrowers in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.78,0)">This is because credit markets in some parts of the euro area are still impaired and show only timid signs of recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As a result, credit growth continues to contract and credit conditions - while having eased recently - remain overall tight from a historical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Importantly, costs of bank funding have improved, but are still relatively high in some Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.52,0)">Where they are lower, they are not passed on in full to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The monetary policy measures decided in June and September this year, the Targeted Longer-term Refinancing Operations and the purchase programmes for asset-backed securities and covered bonds, are designed to overcome these obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">They will enhance the transmission of monetary policy, support the provision of credit to the euro area economy and, as a result, provide further monetary policy accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We see early indications that our credit easing package is delivering tangible benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.29,0)">Since the beginning of June, forward money market rates have shown steep declines across the maturity spectrum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.8,0)">Now, the forward curve consistently lies below zero over a two-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">EONIA is not expected to exceed 25bps before well into 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.83,0)">The 3-month EURIBOR rate, which is an important conduit of monetary policy impulses to lending rates, dropped to all-time lows and now stands close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.22,0)">And the policy decisions, in particular those announced in September, triggered a compression of spreads across other asset classes, including ABS, covered bonds and sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">But more time is needed for the full materialisation of the positive effects of the most recent set of measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">In this context, let me emphasise that we are committed to scale the total magnitude of our measures – lending operations as well as outright purchases – up to a size that can deliver the intended support to inflation and the recovery of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">All these measures will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which we expect to move towards its early 2012 dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This will ensure that our accommodative monetary policy stance will contribute to a gradual recovery and a return of inflation rates in the medium term to levels closer to our aim of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.65,0)">Nonetheless, we need to remain alert to possible downside risks to our outlook for inflation, in particular against the background of a weakening growth momentum and continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">We therefore need to closely monitor and continuously assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">If necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In this context, we have also tasked relevant ECB staff and Eurosystem committees with the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Such measures could include further changes to the size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet, if warranted to achieve price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.4,0)">Monetary policy alone – however – cannot overcome financial fragmentation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.37,0)">Fragmentation across national borders also reflects underlying national imbalances and institutional deficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Overcoming these require determined structural reforms on the side of national governments to improve the business environment and setting incentives to invest, with the aim to boost productivity, create new jobs and raise the growth potential of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Reducing financial fragmentation also requires tackling remaining shortcomings in economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As already mentioned, substantial progress has been made this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Banking union should now be completed following the finalisation of the Comprehensive Assessment and the SSM taking on supervisory responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This means in particular completing the SRM, enhancing the borrowing capacity of the Single Resolution Fund and thereby delivering on the commitment to establish a credible backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Moreover, looking forward, a greater integration of financial markets – also referred to as a Capital Markets Union   – would be warranted to further reduce fragmentation of financial markets, improve funding to SMEs, enhance the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy, and overall benefit economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">We look forward to the detailed elements that the Commission will announce in the course of 2015 and I have no doubt that the European Parliament as co-legislator will again play a decisive role in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The collateral framework of the Eurosystem Let me now say a few words on the second topic you have chosen, our collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Since the very beginning, the Eurosystem collateral framework had been designed to achieve two goals at the same time: First to protect the Eurosystem from incurring losses, as it is explicitly required by the Statute of the ECB/ESCB; second to ensure that Eurosystem credit operations can be carried out smoothly by making sufficient collateral available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The past and recent experience has shown that such a dual set-up of the Eurosystem collateral framework has been indeed very effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.7,0)">So far, the Eurosystem has never had to recognise a loss stemming from the Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the few cases where counterparties have defaulted, for instance in the case of a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers, the Eurosystem was able to fully cover its exposure by seizing the posted collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">At the same time, the collateral framework ensured that banks were able to obtain sufficient amounts of central bank liquidity throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This became most visible in the context of the two Very Long Term Refinancing Operations that the ECB conducted in 2011 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">In these operations banks obtained collateralised central bank liquidity in the order of EUR 524 billion within only 10 weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This basic set-up of the collateral framework has remained the same since the beginning of monetary union; the three constituent parts of the Eurosystem collateral framework, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">the counterparty framework,   the basic eligibility criteria for underlying assets and   the risk control measures, have remained largely unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Eurosystem maintains a broad counterparty framework and its eligibility criteria are still based on the same principles as at the beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This shows that the design of the Eurosystem collateral framework is in general very robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.33,0)">However, some changes were necessary to guarantee a smooth implementation of monetary policy at times of financial market stress that led to a general reduction in access to market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.03,0)">A collateral framework must never act in a pro-cyclical manner: Restricting banks’ access to liquidity in a crisis – for instance, by introducing more restrictive criteria for collateral – might pose a risk not to only to the most vulnerable banks, but to the whole financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Ultimately, this would increase the risk for the central bank’s balance sheet rather than protecting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Hence, in order to enable that a wide range of the counterparties could continue participating in the refinancing operations, the Eurosystem temporarily relaxed some of the eligibility criteria for underlying assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This was done on several occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For instance, from 2008 to 2011 and again as of 2012, we accepted foreign denominated marketable assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In 2012 we created the Additional Credit Claims framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Credit standards have been changed by accepting lower rated assets compared to those accepted at the beginning, notably for ABS that fulfill certain criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">However, these accommodative measures were coupled with a stronger-scrutinised counterparty framework and with more stringent risk control measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a result, the total amount of eligible collateral increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Thus, an enhanced participation of counterparties in the refinancing operations was enabled, while at the same time the risks for the Eurosystem expanded only moderately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Eurosystem collateral framework has been quite complex from the very beginning, not the least because of the variety of national frameworks preceding it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">With the onset of the monetary union, the goal was to provide access to Eurosystem credit operations to a broad range of counterparties, in contrast to some other central banks which rely on a few counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Therefore, the collateral framework had to take into account the various national banking systems and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.91,0)">Some national central banks, for example, accepted credit claims as collateral, while others did not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Some countries had developed covered bond markets, while others only started to set up a respective covered bonds law later, and the same could be said for ABS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For a collateral framework, a common standard had to be found which embraces these national characteristics, while at the same time ensuring that sufficient collateral is available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.44,0)">Several of the measures taken in the crisis have added to this complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Therefore a challenge going forward is to make the collateral framework simpler and more transparent, without impacting the ability of counterparties to access our refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I am confident that we will achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, 2014 has been a year of profound change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But what has been achieved so far is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">2015 needs to be the year when all actors in the euro area, governments and European institutions alike, will deploy a consistent common strategy to bring our economies back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.49,0)">Monetary policy alone will not be able to achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This is why there is an urgent need to agree on concrete short-term commitments for structural reforms in the Member States, on a consequent application of the Stability and Growth Pact, on the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area, on a strategy for investment, and to launch work on a long-term vision to further share sovereignty ensuring the sustainable and smooth functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">On that note, I am looking forward to our discussion.</span>
