    <span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)"> Reflections on financial integration and stability Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Joint ECB-EC Conference on Financial Integration and Stability in a New Financial Architecture,Frankfurt, 28 April 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, Dear colleagues and friends, It is indeed a pleasure to participate in this joint presentation of two important policy reports: the European Commission’s European financial stability and integration report 2013 and the ECB’s Financial integration in Europe 2014 report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Both studies illustrate that some steady, albeit uneven, progress is being made towards financial stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Banks are reducing their liquidity buffers, repaying our LTROs and regaining confidence from the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Money market integration is slowly improving, particularly in the secured segment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Quantity-based indicators confirm a stabilisation in bond markets and improved integration in equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Given where we stood barely two years ago – on the edge of redenomination risks – such progress is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, it does not mean we are entirely out of the danger zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.99,0)">If we look at banking markets, there is still a large dispersion of borrowing costs for non-financial corporations across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.6,0)">Thus, significant financial fragmentation still remains in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is a concern for the recovery and also for monetary and macro-prudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Under the pressure of the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, several solutions – both global and European – have indeed been adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Stronger crisis prevention mechanisms are now in place and a new crisis management framework has been developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.4,0)">We have financial backstops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Framework have been decided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Most of the countries in IMF/EU/ECB adjustment programmes are “graduating” successfully, and several other stressed countries are implementing structural reforms and financial consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">These are important steps forward, towards a more stable and equitable functioning economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">We have certainly turned a corner and stabilised the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is an important achievement but it is not the end of the road as it is too soon to declare that the crisis is over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">The euro area still faces large challenges in terms of lacklustre growth, excessive unemployment, remaining fragmentation and a low inflation period that threatens to aggravate the burden of the debt overhang still besetting governments and private economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">That the stressed countries were able to restore fundamental equilibria, like their external accounts, and to resume positive economic growth is of great importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.08,0)">However, we face now structural medium term challenges that impair the European potential growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">In my remarks today I will concentrate on issues such as the changing financial integration and financial stability nexus, on how to restore a sound and resilient financial system and finally on the need to improve our analytical tools and policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Banks mirror their environment but also contribute to shaping it in many respects When the crisis struck, a significant part of the banking system in several countries had to be kept alive by public capital injections and state guarantees; where strains on liquidity were present, the ECB provided a backstop in its capacity as lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.97,0)">At the height of the crisis several banks found themselves with large vulnerabilities: they were undercapitalised, had fragile funding structures and, in retrospect, many had engaged in unsound lending practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.94,0)">For years, banks in creditor and debtor nations had fuelled the imbalances that so greatly contributed to the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.78,0)">Several banks had thrived on complex structured investments whose risks were not well-understood, and a small number of banks had become immersed in dubious acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.64,0)">This is the “banking narrative” of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.63,0)">It is true that in some countries banks were also victimised by their sovereign, especially after 2010 when the ratings and access to market suffered the contagion from what was happening with the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.1,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, banks generated instability and are now recognised as having been part of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">With the completion of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the phasing-in of a sound banking regulatory and supervisory framework and the strengthening of banks’ governance and ethical standards, banks can become active parts of the solution to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Yet, these are necessary but insufficient conditions to ensure that the banking system will again become a vibrant financial engine of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Because, over long periods of time, the soundness and resilience of banks also hinges on the dynamism of the economy and society: hence the habitat of banks also has to draw itself out of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The sustainability of public and private finances and the health of the broader financial system are also critical components in securing a successful and resilient banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.58,0)">The crisis has left a heavy, uneven structural legacy across the euro area As the earlier stages of this multi-layered financial crisis unfolded, it became apparent that several banks had grown far too large for their economies, making the fate of several governments and banks ever more intertwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.04,0)">Fears of debt unsustainability in Greece sparked concerns also about the public finances and financial health of other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.53,0)">Some speak of a twin crisis of “two debt overhangs”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.05,0)">Others speak of the “sovereign-bank nexus”: they are all referring to the same phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.68,0)">That was when the “doom loop” between weak sovereigns and weak banks took hold to full effect and when the flaws in the design of Economic and Monetary Union   became most damaging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.33,0)">While significant progress has been made towards rectifying governance failings and design flaws, the burden of the crisis on sovereigns, households and banks is considerable and unevenly distributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.41,0)">Today, growth is low in many countries that are also overwhelmed by high unemployment, especially among the youth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.76,0)">The general situation of lack of internal demand when some external markets start also to decelerate, explains that investment is still almost 20 per cent below what it was in 2007 which affects our potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.68,0)">A declining demography and insufficient progress in total factor productivity, further limit Europe´s growth capabilities and make it more difficult the absorption of the existing high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.05,0)">Such dynamics thwart the deleveraging process of sovereigns and households, and complicate the return of bank balance sheets to financial health.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.6,0)">In my view, the legacy of the crisis constitutes still a vulnerability for the transition process to a more effective and robust EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.14,0)">It stokes scepticism, which itself impedes the solutions to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The situation had long required bold institutional reforms to the design of monetary union and we should praise the European Commission for having quickly prepared proposals for a Banking Union in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The banking union must be instrumental in resolving the crisis In my view, the banking union must be instrumental in resolving the crisis and unravelling its legacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">It is the crucial node to secure both financial integration and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The reason is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In the euro area, about 75% of the real economy’s financing needs still originate from the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What is more, banks are crucial counterparties in the broader system of financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Therefore, the importance of establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism and creating a level playing field for all banks across Europe cannot be overemphasized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A relevant part of this endeavour is the Comprehensive Assessment of bank´s balance-sheets that will precede the beginning of the supervisory tasks by the ECB/SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Aiming at completing the balance-sheet repair of the banks subject to the SSM it will improve their capital and solvency position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In spite of the recent credit negative behaviour being mostly the result of lack of demand, the enhanced robustness of banks will overcome remaining credit supply restrictions that could hamper the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.02,0)">This process of repairing the banking system is only one part of the challenge policymakers face in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The other, more fundamental part is to build a safer and more resilient financial sector that serves the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is ultimately the objective of the next phase of banking union: building a single European supervisor via the Single Supervisory Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">There are four ways in particular I expect the SSM to make a difference to banking in Europe: by improving the quality of supervision; by creating a more homogenous application of rules and standards; by improving incentives for deeper banking integration; and by strengthening the application of macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The SSM should create the conditions and incentives for deeper integration of the European banking market, which should in turn make the euro area less vulnerable to fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Barriers that existed in the past to deeper retail banking integration, for example opaque supervisory approval procedures, will no longer be relevant with a single European supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The substantial compliance costs that came from having to observe different sets of rules and interact with several different authorities should also be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, the benefits of cross-border integration should increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Cross-border banking groups will be able to optimise their internal management of capital and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Further efforts to reduce fragmentation and a drive to achieve genuine banking integration can help Europe exit the crisis in at least three ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, more integrated banking markets intensify competition: banks, as well as other financial market participants, will have to change their strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">More competition means that capital is allocated more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This promotes access to new funding opportunities for companies, encourages investment and thus contributes to higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.24,0)">Small and medium-sized enterprises without direct access to capital markets, in particular, may benefit the most from defragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, for the ECB, a re-integrated banking sector will ease the transmission of monetary policy impulses and thus enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Third, in several monetary unions, genuine financial market integration helps smooth out the effects of asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This mechanism of risk sharing can operate through income insurance, for example, when a country’s residents hold claims to dividends, interest or rental income from investments in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">In the US this form of risk-sharing has been shown to be more important than federal budget transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In the euro area, such risk sharing will need to assume an increasingly more important role, especially given the absence of a more significant central budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.65,0)">On the other hand, incomplete financial integration carries significant risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">As the crisis has demonstrated, financial integration increased the risk of contagion, without in parallel generating adequate risk-sharing arrangements to offset its adverse effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">For example, increased cross-border interbank funding was not accompanied by a sufficient diversification of investment risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.79,0)">As a result, banks in some jurisdictions quickly accumulated significant exposures to local assets  , and when the crisis hit, cross-border funding was quickly withdrawn and sizeable losses had to be absorbed within national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.65,0)">Looking ahead, lack of genuine financial integration and low resilience will always expose us to systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.74,0)">The crisis has also exposed our lack of some fundamental analytical tools and policy instruments The complexity and sequencing of the crisis, as well as its morphing over time, have also exposed our weak understanding of micro- and macro-fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Here, I am talking about basic notions, not only more advanced concepts and elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.81,0)">Few economists saw the financial crisis coming, understood the serious risks generated by persistent imbalances and recognised the deep changes in economic structures and financial markets that were under way during the build-up to the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.48,0)">With EMU, the nature of prevalent shocks has changed to slow moving processes that are more difficult to tackle with the few adjustment mechanisms at the disposal of stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.16,0)">Facing this crisis, we were armed with a toolkit that was suited to a previous era: i.e., inadequate models and limited monitoring tools to support EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It is thus understandable that the crisis has also heralded a “renaissance of research”, with both positive and normative implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">One of the least acknowledged outcomes of the crisis is the enrichment of our professional toolkit to conduct economic, monetary and financial analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Existing databases, models, analytical tools and forecasting and projection apparatuses have been overhauled and enhanced, and new ones have been added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Through our Department of Research we have invested in all areas of micro- and macro-research that are directly and indirectly beneficial to our economic and monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We have launched research initiatives across European countries to understand how economies work and what drives innovation, productivity, competitiveness, growth, employment, equality and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me mention just a few examples of such initiatives undertaken by the ECB and the Eurosystem: There is the Competitiveness Research Network, known as CompNet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Its objective is to identify what drives the dynamics of competitiveness and productivity across EU countries and heterogeneous firms, and relate the findings to policy outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">CompNet has already assembled millions of data points and observations in order to capture “non-price competitiveness”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">This initiative is already showing that we need to augment our analyses with a global value chains dimension, as the internationalisation of production matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Had we had anything similar prior to the crisis we would have been in a better position to anticipate the effects of the propagation of the crisis along the supply chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is the Household Finance & Consumption Network  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Its objective is to conduct surveys to collect household-level data on households’ income, expenditure, assets, debt and collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The data can then be aggregated to gauge a measure of distress of individual households and to calculate credit risk indicators, such as the probability of default, exposure at default or loss given default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.27,0)">Such indicators can then be subject to stress tests for which a scenario can combine an unemployment shock with an interest rate shock and a house price shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Had such data been available prior to the crisis, it would have facilitated the identification of household borrowing and spending exuberance in several countries at an earlier stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is the Macro-prudential Research Network  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Its objective is to develop core conceptual frameworks, models and tools that provide research support in order to improve macro-prudential supervision in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The work performed under MaRs can yield more complex economic, financial and monetary indicators that can more adequately address the complexities inherent in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the context of MaRs and also resulting from work in our own Department of Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability, we have developed analytical tools that include, for instance, early warning systems that can go to the level of individual banks, decision tree risk models, structural VARs and Global VARs , contagion network models and top-down stress test models for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">One of the least acknowledged outcomes of the crisis is the wealth of tools and models now available for conducting in-depth economic, monetary and financial stability analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Looking at on-going developments, we are better able to interpret the current situation and assess the fiscal and monetary stances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">A good example of this improved understanding is the development of the SYNFINT, the Synthetic Financial Integration Indicator, presented in our Report and that is based on measures of cross-country price dispersion in the money, bond, equity and banking markets in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Looking ahead, we are also better equipped to warn about looming systemic risks or adjustment failings, as well as to identify strengths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Macro-prudential policy will have an important role to play One of the more important goals of the on-going research is the grounding and calibration of macroprudential instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.77,0)">The need for a macro-prudential perspective is one of the main lessons stemming from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In fact, the whole regulatory reform after the crisis was internationally discussed in Basle or in the FSB and the G20, from the macro-prudential perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Indeed improving the design of Financial Regulation to ensure a resilient system is the first instrument of macro-prudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">I see macro-prudential policy as particularly important for the single currency, as macroprudential tools can in principle allow policymakers to address financial imbalances in a more country-specific and granular way I acknowledge that we do not yet have a large body of evidence on the effectiveness of these policies, especially in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">That said, the studies that do exist tentatively support the conclusion that macro-prudential policy can be effective in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Asset-side measures like LTV, LTI and DTI in particular have been found to be effective in dampening real estate booms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">As this was the sector at the heart of the crisis in several euro area countries, this is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Further research in this area is essential to help us better understand the impact and transmission channels of macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Questions of effectiveness aside, where the SSM represents a major step forward in macro-prudential policy, is in creating some centralisation of macro-prudential decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The SSM Regulation gives the ECB the power to apply stricter macro-prudential measures than national authorities if it deems necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This allows us to take an integrated view of macro-prudential policy – spillovers, arbitrage effects – and provides a safeguard against inaction bias at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Moreover, the important role of the ECB Governing Council in macro-prudential decision-making allows for interactions between monetary policy and macro-prudential policy to be internalised and synergies to be exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.81,0)">To give just one example, several of the non-standard measures we have adopted during the crisis, such as changes in collateral haircuts or reserve requirements, might in certain cases overlap with macro-prudential measures like liquidity ratios and margin requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This suggests that macro-prudential policies can support us in fulfilling our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Since the launch of the euro, we have become more interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Trade and financial links have deepened further and most companies and many banks have acquired a European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We are, de facto, each other’s stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.28,0)">During the crisis we have seen how what happens in one euro area country, however big or small, reverberates in all others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The crisis has partly reversed some integration but, as shown in the two reports, we are now witnessing a degree of financial market de-fragmentation and reintegration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">We are also waiting for more sound research and analysis to come on stream.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">A deeper understanding of the issues involved is paramount to making further progress on any one of the multitude of fronts that we still need to explore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">So, to this end, it is with great pleasure that I now give the floor to our panellists for what I anticipate will be an in-depth and fruitful discussion on the state of financial integration after the experience of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Constâncio  ,
