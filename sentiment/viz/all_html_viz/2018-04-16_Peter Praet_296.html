    <span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)"> Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union: lessons and challenges for economic policies Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the NABE Symposium, 16 April 2018 Slides from the presentation The ongoing economic expansion shows that our monetary policy has been effective in laying the groundwork for a return of inflation to a rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Euro area real GDP has expanded for 19 consecutive quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The latest economic data and survey results point towards some moderation of late, following several quarters of very strong growth Inflation developments, however, remain subdued, and we have not yet met the Governing Council’s three criteria – convergence, confidence and resilience – for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, which is our stated condition for ceasing our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Hence, we must be patient, persistent and prudent with our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.29,0)">Figure 1: Price level   Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color:

style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">Latest observations: 2017  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Our monetary policy has effectively contributed to euro area macroeconomic adjustment through the staunch pursuit of our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.78,0)">Monetary policy, however, is only one side of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for sustained and balanced growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The run-up to the crisis proved that macroeconomic imbalances can grow amid price stability  , highlighting the need to keep economic policy high on Europe’s agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Tonight I would like to concentrate on economic policies and their essential role in ensuring a smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will look back at the experience of the euro area since 1999 and illustrate the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances by focusing on three countries: Spain, Germany and France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The crisis acted as a litmus test for Europe’s institutional framework, revealing the need for a number of institutional reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Lessons have been learned and significant progress towards strengthening EMU has been achieved, including elevating the responsibility of banking supervision from national to the European level, the creation of the European Stability Mechanism as a permanent crisis management institution, and improvements in the EU surveillance framework for economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Progress towards completing the banking union and the capital markets union has rightly emerged as one of the immediate priorities in strengthening EMU,  not least as such progress is seen as crucial in supporting macroeconomic adjustment in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Today it is fair to say that the euro area has lived up to the challenges posed by the existential crisis and euro area countries have displayed a strong commitment to EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.67,0)">Macroeconomic adjustment in EMU has made significant progress, with countries implementing significant growth-enhancing reforms and correcting external imbalances, but this process has been difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Countries most affected by the crisis were confronted with significant hardship, even though financial support provided by the Union and its Member States to countries facing acute financing difficulties prevented catastrophic outcomes and cushioned some of its impact by providing time for economic adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Looking forward, in order to sustain a high level of social welfare in the long term, it is essential for euro area countries to improve their capacity to prevent crisis and hence to ensure that macroeconomic adjustment progresses in a smoother way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.63,0)">The emergence of macroeconomic imbalances The crisis has demonstrated how persistent losses in competitiveness can translate into macroeconomic imbalances, eventually leading to a painful adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Spain’s experience during the crisis is instructive in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">With the start of Monetary Union, the disappearance of exchange rate risk premia and the unprecedented fall in interest rates facilitated capital inflows and encouraged risk-taking behaviour, resulting in a rapid rise in private debt and a property boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.97,0)">The expectation of higher levels of income led to excessive consumption and investment relative to the supply capacity of the Spanish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.18,0)">This continuous demand pressure generated a positive inflation differential vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area, leading to a strong appreciation of the real exchange rate and an erosion of price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">When the crisis hit, the subsequent adjustment was severe – with unemployment rising above 25 percent, a rapid erosion of the fiscal position and a number of bank failures – leading to a significant contraction in both domestic demand   and real GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The same was true for other current account deficit countries, such as Portugal, Ireland and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.42,0)">For countries with large current account deficits, the adjustment was painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.19,0)">The correction of euro area macroeconomic imbalances was particularly asymmetric, with the bulk of the adjustment falling on current account deficit countries through a strong contraction in domestic demand, with limited support from a higher demand contribution from current account surplus countries, despite those countries being less affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Growth in the surplus countries, including Germany, became even more export-oriented  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">An important lesson from the crisis was that the euro area had insufficient tools at its disposal to, on the one hand, prevent the build-up of unsustainable asset price booms and, on the other hand, mitigate their impact if they do occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The answer to such problems lies, ex ante, in better macroprudential and microprudential policies and better regulation of the financial system and, ex post, in better resolution institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Strengthening Europe’s financial framework, including the establishment of the banking union, is the right way to address this source of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is of the utmost importance to complete the banking union without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">Figure 3: Domestic demand   Sources: Global Financial database, Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.68,0)">Latest observation:

rgb(255,240.68,0)">Latest observation: 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.97,0)">Competitiveness problems in the euro area can also be attributed to factors other than the financial cycle, such as the lack of adequate wage and price flexibility or impediments to factor mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The importance of such economic factors already featured prominently in the theory of optimal currency areas, as pioneered by Mundell in 1961.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">Competitiveness imbalances are one of the most visible symptoms of insufficient macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The developments in Germany and France – two countries which together represent nearly half of euro area GDP, and have seen broadly similar movements in GDP and in prices   since the start of Monetary Union – are instructive in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.23,0)">Figure 5: Price level   Sources: AMECO and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">Latest observations: 2017  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.49,0)">Figure 6: Domestic demand and GDP   Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.26,0)">Latest observations: 2017Q4  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.77,0)">Germany, at the start of Monetary Union, was considered the “sick man of Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.0,0)">At the time, the country was still recovering from the high costs associated with its reunification and its conversion rate was widely considered to be overvalued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The national policy response was a prolonged period of union-backed wage moderation  together with a significant labour market overhaul which aimed, among other things, at improving job search efficiency and employment flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.14,0)">The result was striking: from 1999 to 2008, nominal unit labour costs were virtually unchanged for the economy as a whole   and were thus growing significantly below what the “golden wage rule” would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.19,0)">This resulted in a strong export performance, but weak domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The economic policies Germany pursued before the crisis largely explain why it emerged relatively unscathed from the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Exports recovered swiftly and currently stand at an all-time high, roughly equalling half of the country’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Exports recovered particularly strongly towards non euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.55,0)">As a result, the decline in the euro area share in total German exports accelerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.8,0)">Meanwhile, the domestic demand contribution to GDP continued on its downward path, in part on account of subdued wage growth together with a tight fiscal policy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.67,0)">Figure 7: Compensation per employee   Sources: Ameco and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.68,0)">Latest observation: 2017  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.73,0)">Figure

style="background-color: rgb(255,242.35,0)">Figure 10: Traded sector mark up   Sources: AMECO and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.11,0)">Last observation: 2016  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In contrast to Germany, France entered Monetary Union in much better shape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.91,0)">Growth in the initial years was strong and unemployment declined by more than a fourth within five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.31,0)">Wage increases remained moderate, even below euro area averages  , and unit labour costs moved according to the “golden wage rule”, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.84,0)">at an average annual rate below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, with German unit labour costs remaining virtually unchanged over the period, a significant competitiveness gap built up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">This was further aggravated by the crisis, during which French wages remained relatively sticky, in spite of the sharp fall in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.04,0)">The consequences were especially detrimental for the French export sector, which suffered significant losses in market share  , despite the substantial squeeze in profit margins  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">At the same time, the contribution of domestic demand to growth became increasingly important, supported by fiscal policy   and sticky wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.9,0)">Figure 11: France: net lending/borrowing   Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.96,0)">Latest observation: 2017Q3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">Figure 12: Germany: net lending/borrowing   Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.96,0)">Latest observation: 2017Q3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.16,0)">As a result, there is now a striking divergence between France and Germany on a number of macroeconomic dimensions: in Germany, the domestic demand to GDP ratio is now among the lowest across advanced economies, whereas in France, it is among the highest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.88,0)">The opposite is true for exports  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.16,0)">Figure 13: Domestic demand   Sources: Global Financial database, Eurostat and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.68,0)">Latest observation: 2017.</span><span style="background-color:

style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The recent economic policy orientations and plans set out by the German and French authorities are steps in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In particular, the labour market reforms that have already been implemented by the French authorities, and those that are still planned, could yield sizeable growth benefits and improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">These recent developments show that cross-country interdependencies in the Monetary Union are better internalised in national decision-making processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Some lessons for the future Our monetary policy measures are bearing fruit, and the growth outlook confirms our confidence that inflation will converge towards our aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.38,0)">Monetary policy alone cannot prevent divergences in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Sound economic policies are the key drivers of Europe’s prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">They are pivotal to the smooth functioning of EMU, thereby preventing the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">The nature of EMU makes macroeconomic adjustment in the euro area more complex than in a federal state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy is a competence assigned at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The European Central Bank’s price stability objective is enshrined in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By contrast, economic policy remains in the remit of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is, however, a Treaty obligation for Member States to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">Our framework for the coordination of economic policies was clearly not effective in preventing the emergence of lasting imbalances in the euro area in the run-up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.66,0)">Protracted losses of competitiveness eventually led to unsustainable external positions and even “sudden stops” in the financing of external deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">This is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.76,0)">Unfortunately, we can point to several episodes in history when governments and social partners failed to internalise external constraints, resulting in widening imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.96,0)">This typically led to currency crises and exchange rate realignments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.96,0)">Monetary instability prevented Europeans from reaping the full benefit of the internal market and limited Europe’s growth potential and emergence as a global economic actor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In our institutional framework for economic policies, it is primarily up to the Member States to respond to the economic challenges they are faced with, thereby ensuring that their economic structures are compatible with participation in Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">To reap the full benefit of Monetary Union, it is essential to ensure that national economic policies lead to sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Preventing the emergence of economic imbalances and creating the conditions for a thriving social market economy is not only a matter of national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.5,0)">It is also a matter of common concern, as a crisis in one country has repercussions for all members of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Effective surveillance is needed at both EU and national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Looking ahead, we need to further enhance the coordination of national economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">National economic policies, the effects of which can propagate through the EU, should no longer be decided in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the European level, the European Semester process for the coordination of economic policies – including the macroeconomic imbalance procedure – which was introduced by the EU in 2011, can play a key role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, it should be used to its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Equally important, though, is for national debates and decision-making processes to more fully internalise what it means to be part of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Precisely for this purpose, the Five Presidents’ Report of 12 February 2015  called for the set-up of National Competitiveness Authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These bodies are intended to foster national responsibility for identifying any necessary reforms and facilitating their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Subsequently, the Council of the European Union adopted on 19 September 2016 a Recommendation for the establishment of National Productivity Boards  and Member States were invited to implement the Recommendation by 20 March 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">We should make full use of this Recommendation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">National Productivity Boards have the potential to become an important catalyst in supporting the sound functioning of national adjustment mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">I would like to thank Isabel Vansteenkiste for her support in preparing this speech.</span><span style="background-color:

budgetary surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact,   the introduction of a new procedure in the area of macroeconomic imbalances,   the establishment of a framework for dealing with countries experiencing difficulties with financial stability and   the codification in legislation of integrated economic and budgetary surveillance in the form of the European Semester  .</span><span
