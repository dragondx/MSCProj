    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)"> Monetary policy in a prolonged period of low inflation Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking,Sintra, 26 May 2014 *** Summary In the context of a certain disconnect between economic performance and inflation the monetary policy response has to be carefully considered and precisely designed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.36,0)">We are not resigned to allowing inflation to remain too low for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But to understand “what is too low for too long”, we need to answer two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.65,0)">First, why is inflation so low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">Second, once we have a decomposition of inflation, we can ask: how likely is it that it persists over the medium-term?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">Falling commodity prices have accounted for around 80% of the decline in euro area inflation since late 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But there are two factors specific to the euro area that contribute to low inflation: the rise in the euro exchange rate and the process of relative price adjustments in certain euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">At present, our expectation is that low inflation will be prolonged but gradually return to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.13,0)">What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.87,0)">There is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.0,0)">This may then cause households and firms to defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle – especially when monetary policy is at the effective lower bound and so cannot steer the nominal rate down to compensate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.21,0)">On aggregate, euro area firms and households do not seem to be particularly exposed to debt deflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.93,0)">But this picture masks the heterogeneity within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Debt service-to-income ratios tend to be higher in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.06,0)">Credit weakness appears to be contributing to economic weakness in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">Our analysis suggests that credit constraints are putting a brake on the recovery in stressed countries, which adds to the disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And heterogeneity becomes a factor in assessing low inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">In terms of the monetary policy response, the key issue is timing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We have to be mindful of mismatches between the various trends: the rise in demand for credit; the repair of bank balance sheets; and the development of capital markets as a complement to bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At this point of the cycle, these considerations feature prominently in the discussions of the Governing Council members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">There is no debate about our goal, which is to return inflation towards 2% in the medium-term, in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">*** Ladies and gentlemen, When we first thought about launching this forum in the spring of last year, we saw a clear value in setting aside time to withdraw from the pressure of our daily routines and the immediacy of decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The idea was to devote time to in-depth reflection on how to address the fundamental challenges facing central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.1,0)">In the event, the opportunity for in-depth reflection has proven as valuable as we expected – but our ability to detach from the pressures of the moment has been less than we thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.86,0)">We are meeting against the backdrop of a complex economic situation: a slowly consolidating recovery, but one which has been accompanied by a gradual fall in inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.41,0)">Cyclical developments are also interacting with structural developments, notably the structural deleveraging of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">All this warrants discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.21,0)">To some extent, a disconnect between economic performance and inflation is to be expected in the very early stages of the economic upturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As households and firms resume their spending plans in the aftermath of a long period of restraint, they tend initially to use existing resources more intensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This raises measured productivity, but causes employment to return more slowly towards its potential, which reduces price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, the monetary policy response has to be carefully considered and precisely designed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">We do not want to be too reactive to those parts of the disinflationary process that are expected to self-correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.36,0)">We neither want to be too forbearing towards those factors that, if left unchecked, can lastingly undermine price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.36,0)">We are not resigned to allowing inflation to remain too low for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But to understand “what is too low for too long”, we need to answer two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.65,0)">First, why is inflation so low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.22,0)">This is essentially a question about the anatomy of inflation, meaning the nature of the shocks that are causing inflation to deviate from its intended level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">Second, once we have a decomposition of inflation, we can ask: how likely is it that it persists over the medium-term?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.84,0)">This is a question related to the physiology of inflation, meaning how current low inflation influences economic behaviour and impacts the economy, notably through the formation of expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Through the filter of these two questions, I would like to use my remarks this morning to discuss the forthcoming decisions facing the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">The anatomy of disinflation Low inflation is not particular to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Inflation is low across advanced economies, mainly due to the diminishing effect of oil prices on consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But looking at the anatomy of inflation, there are two factors specific to the euro area that contribute to especially low inflation here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The first is a common factor: the rise in the euro exchange rate and its effect on the price of internationally traded commodities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.39,0)">The second is a local factor: the process of relative price adjustment in certain euro area countries that pulls down aggregate inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me explain each of these in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">Common factors Falling commodity prices explain the lion’s share of the disinflation the euro area has experienced since the end of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.3,0)">Brent crude oil prices were down by around 7% in euro terms in the first quarter of this year, compared with a year earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.99,0)">Food prices were sharply down as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.53,0)">In fact, these two components have together accounted for around 80% of the decline in euro area HICP inflation since late 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The bulk of the imported downside pressures on euro area consumer prices are explained by the strengthening of the effective euro exchange rate, in particular vis-à-vis the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.68,0)">In the past year or so, oil prices in US dollars have fluctuated – by historical standards – over a relatively narrow range.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.09,0)">And they have exhibited no clear downward or upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.74,0)">This creates a balance of forces that might affect future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.99,0)">On the one hand, lower commodity prices driven by euro appreciation help compensate for the generally weak developments in disposable income in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.91,0)">Indeed, real disposable income declined at slower pace throughout 2013, and turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter, increasing by 0.6% year-on-year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.29,0)">To the extent that this supports domestic demand in the euro area it will also create upward pressure on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.04,0)">On the other hand, exchange rate appreciation affects external demand and reduces the competitiveness gains of price and cost adjustment in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.11,0)">This has a countervailing effect on real disposable incomes, while also making disinflation more broad-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.86,0)">Indeed, if we look at prices of non-energy industrial goods, which are mainly tradable, we see a downward trend across all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.63,0)">Local factors To add to this, aggregate inflation has been dragged down by local factors linked to the sovereign debt crisis and the process of relative price adjustment in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Several euro area countries are currently undergoing internal devaluation to regain price competitiveness, both internationally and within the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The crucial adjustments vis-à-vis other euro area countries have to take place irrespective of changes in the external value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.57,0)">This process began hesitantly in the early years of the crisis, largely due to nominal rigidities in wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The result was that adjustment took place more through quantities – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.28,0)">unemployment – than through prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.45,0)">Stressed countries thus experienced a protracted period of declining disposable incomes and long-drawn-out price adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.88,0)">In this context, several have seen domestic core inflation – that is, excluding the energy and food price effects I just described – fall well below the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.96,0)">For example, the recent overall fall in services price inflation for the euro area is almost entirely accounted for by price declines in these components in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Nevertheless, in the last few years relative price adjustment has accelerated in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">While this may also have initially weighed on disposable incomes, by creating a closer alignment between relative wage and productivity developments, it should increasingly support future incomes through the competitiveness channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Export growth has been impressive in several stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">And indeed, nominal income growth in stressed countries turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.22,0)">The physiology of disinflation So to sum up: falling energy and food prices, coupled with the effects of relative price adjustment in stressed countries, explain almost fully the disinflation we have seen in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We also see that disinflation produces counterveiling forces, which may in time cause it to self-correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">To what extent should monetary policy therefore react to these developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">The answer relates to the physiology of inflation: whether or not these factors are likely to persist into the medium-term and therefore enter the horizon of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.47,0)">Temporary movements in the exchange rate or relative price adjustments would not normally warrant a monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.93,0)">Given the lag in monetary policy transmission, a monetary impulse would hit the economy just when the effect on inflation has faded out and the impulse is no longer necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.34,0)">That said, shocks can change: in certain circumstances temporary shocks can morph into persistent shocks via second-round effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.61,0)">In particular, a prolonged period of low or even negative inflation rates might destabilise inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And we know from international experience this change can happen quite quickly, especially if the objective of monetary policy is not clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.3,0)">Thus, we have to judge carefully how an apparently temporary shock is spreading through the economy and affecting expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.77,0)">Moreover, the situation is more complex if there are impairments in monetary policy transmission that extend the lag between our decisions and their impact on prices, as we see in the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.6,0)">In these circumstances, there is a risk that, if a temporary shock turns more persistent, any monetary policy response might arrive too late to prevent a more serious downward shift in expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Thus, more pre-emptive action may be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">At present, our expectation is that low inflation will be prolonged but gradually return to close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.78,0)">What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is, in my view, the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">Low inflation, expectations and credit Remember that countries undertaking relative price adjustments have to adjust relative to the average rate of euro area inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Low inflation therefore lowers the “nominal bar” around which such adjustments across countries have to happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.73,0)">In these circumstances, stressed countries will likely experience a temporary period of very low or negative inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is what we see in the euro area at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But here the common and local sources of disinflation I mentioned earlier interact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The effect of an appreciating exchange rate is to hold down overall euro area inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The nominal bar around which adjustment takes place is lower: In particular, we see a rise in inflation in non-stressed countries that is insufficient to raise the euro area average back to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.8,0)">And the downward adjustment in the stressed countries becomes probably harder and certainly longer, especially if nominal rigidities imply that prices and costs cannot adjust quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.12,0)">In this situation, there is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.0,0)">This may then cause households and firms to defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle – especially when monetary policy is at the effective lower bound and so cannot steer the nominal rate down to compensate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.93,0)">In addition, an unexpected period of low inflation and low nominal income results in a higher actual and expected future real debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.23,0)">Unless compensated for by expectations of higher future income, firms may reduce investment and households consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.96,0)">Banks may in turn respond to this situation with stricter credit standards, which reinforces disinflationary pressure and hence worsens debt burdens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.67,0)">This is fertile ground for a pernicious negative spiral, which then also affects expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Propagation through the euro area So do we see any signs that low inflation might propagate through the euro area in this way?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.21,0)">On aggregate, euro area firms and households do not seem to be particularly exposed to debt deflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.12,0)">The interest payment burden of euro area firms – the ratio of their gross interest payments to gross operating surplus – has actually fallen from 22% in 2008 to less than 12% at the end of 2013, which suggests that firms are in a stronger position today to withstand a period of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">For euro area households debt service-to-income ratios are similar – around 14% – while the median household holds the equivalent of around two months’ income in liquid assets to cushion nominal income shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But importantly, this picture masks the heterogeneity mentioned previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For firms in some countries the interest payment burden has in fact risen since 2008, in particular for firms based in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Debt service-to-income ratios also tend to be higher in stressed countries, implying greater vulnerabilities in these jurisdictions if low inflation persists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.49,0)">Bank lending also presents a mixed picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Surveys of bank behaviour show a gradually improving aggregate situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to the latest Bank Lending Survey credit conditions generally stabilised at the start of this year, and even improved in some stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.78,0)">The incremental tightening process that banks reported throughout the crisis seems to have come to a halt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">That said, credit conditions remain very heterogeneous across countries and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.13,0)">According to the latest ECB survey on credit access by small- and medium-sized enterprises  , supply constraints remain especially strong for SMEs in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.77,0)">The percentage of financially constrained but viable SMEs – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">those with positive turnover in the last six months seeking a bank loan – varies from a minimum of 1% in Germany and Austria to a quarter of the total population in Spain and as much as a third in Portugal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.07,0)">Importantly, credit weakness appears to be contributing to economic weakness in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">To show this, one can undertake a quantitative exercise to compute “normal credit”, similar to the notion of potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.05,0)">The difference between the actual volume of credit and normal credit offers a measure of the “credit gap”, analogous to the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Not surprisingly, this exercise reveals that in non-stressed economies the credit gap is either insignificant or making a very small contribution to economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.7,0)">In stressed economies, the same measure contributes to up to a third of economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.53,0)">This analysis suggests that credit constraints are putting a brake on the recovery in stressed countries, which adds to disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">You can also see why the heterogeneity becomes a factor in assessing low inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Calibrating the policy response What is the right policy response to these developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Essentially, we are confronting three issues that might warrant a response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, the common effect of exogenous factors, including the exchange rate, on euro area inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.69,0)">Second, the asymmetric effect of endogenous developments, such as tight access to credit for parts and sectors of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.93,0)">And third, the risk that those effects combine to generate a more persistent regime of excessively low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me elaborate on those three issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, to the extent that developments in the exchange rate, money or capital markets result in an unwarranted tightening of monetary and financial conditions, this would require adjustment of our conventional instruments, so as to secure the degree of monetary accommodation intended by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.48,0)">At the other end of the spectrum would be a too prolonged downward departure of inflation and/or inflation expectations from our projected baseline scenario, for example due to the interaction between exchange rate developments and medium-term inflation expectations as I explained earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">This would call for a more expansionary stance, which would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.41,0)">An intermediate situation is one where credit supply constraints interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and impair the effects of our intended monetary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">This would require targeted measures to help alleviate credit constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.39,0)">I would like to dwell shortly on this contingency because it relates to the important question of whether weak credit growth results from low credit demand or supply constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.49,0)">Weak credit demand in the early stages of an economic recovery is not unusual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.41,0)">Credit growth typically lags the recovery by three to four quarters as firms draw down internal funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">But a recovery eventually results in growing credit demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And at this point, for monetary policy to produce its full effects, there must be no binding constraints on credit supply through the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The more the recovery progresses, the more important it is that supply constraints ease so that the recovery can gather steam.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Given where we are in the cycle today, it is highly desirable that banks advance the structural adjustment of their balance sheets, so that they can meet demand for credit as it emerges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is in part for this reason that we early on placed a great deal of emphasis on a timely comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets, in the context of the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.64,0)">Frontloading bank balance sheet adjustment addresses capital constraints on credit supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Only banks that have fully accounted for legacy losses and hold sufficient equity can take on risk again and therefore originate and price loans in normal conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The comprehensive assessment, while still ongoing, has already had a catalytic effect on asset revaluation and provisioning and on capital raising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We expect it also to feed through into new credit as it reaches completion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Meeting credit demand is likewise why we have publicly supported measures to revive high quality securitisation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This complements the comprehensive assessment by helping remove capital constraints to loan origination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">And it supports the development of capital markets, which will be essential to sustain credit supply while the banking system transitions towards a less leveraged, less risky model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">The key issue today, however, is timing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We have to be mindful of mismatches between these various trends: the rise in demand for credit; the repair of bank balance sheets; and the development of capital markets as a complement to bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Credit demand may pick up more quickly than the other trends gain traction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">If, in this context, availability of term funding is a limiting factor on loan origination, then monetary policy can play a bridging role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Term-funding of loans, be it on-balance sheet – that is, through refinancing operations – or off-balance sheet – that is, through purchases of asset-backed securities – could help reduce any drag on the recovery coming from temporary credit supply constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.79,0)">What I have laid out today is a decomposition of the factors behind low inflation in the euro area, and how they interact, percolate through the real economy and may affect medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At this point of the cycle, all three contingencies I have discussed remain topical and feature prominently in the discussions of the Governing Council members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Certainly, any policy response requires a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of the various tools at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">But there is no debate about our goal, which is to return inflation towards 2% in the medium-term, in line with our mandate.</span>
