    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)"> Should we have faith in central banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Speech by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, St. Edmund's College Millennium Year Lecture, Cambridge, 26 October 2000 Ultimately, trust must be earned, it is granted temporarily, it must be checked, and it must be backed up by hard evidence, not be based purely on faith or belief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">It is a great honour and a great pleasure for me to deliver the St. Edmund's College Millennium Lecture on the topic of faith in central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.23,0)">I must confess that when Professor Heap first invited me to give a talk on 'Faith and Finance in the New Millennium' as part of a series of lectures on the general theme 'Faith in the Future' I suffered an initial instant of hesitation or lack of faith, if you will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As you can imagine 'faith' is not a natural subject to discuss for a central banker and economist, who is trained to look at facts and hard evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">To address such a difficult issue in such a distinguished seat of learning as Cambridge University would seem to require a good measure of courage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But then, of course, courage - if not faith - is an attribute that central bankers should undoubtedly possess.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I am also much reassured and grateful for the faith, if I may say so, that you put in me by inviting me to talk about this subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.11,0)">To make my job a little bit easier - and pull the topic a little closer to my 'home turf' - I have taken the liberty to change the title of the lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">I have also turned it into a question: 'Should we have faith in central banks?'</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I should admit from the start that I do not have an obvious and clear-cut answer for you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.9,0)">If there was a simple answer it would not have been an interesting question to ask ... and it would have been a very brief Millennium Lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So I will try to approach this question a bit in the spirit of how I presume that Cambridge undergraduates might tackle their weekly essay questions, but hopefully - given my lack of practice - I will not be graded quite as harshly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A look at the dictionary Should we have faith in central banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">My answer to this question depends on what is meant by 'faith'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A natural starting point is to take a look at the dictionary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">The term 'faith' is used in a religious context as well as in everyday language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.98,0)">From the Concise Oxford Dictionary - if you allow me to make reference to 'the other place' here - I take away three main uses of the term 'faith'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These different meanings are also reflected in the history of philosophical approaches to faith and belief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">First, there is the theological meaning of faith as 'belief in religious doctrine', 'spiritual apprehension of divine truth apart from proof' or, more generally, 'belief founded on authority'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Here, Blaise Pascal springs to mind as an advocate of a strict separation between faith and reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In his view one could not arrive at faith by means of reasoning but only 'through the heart'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.54,0)">On this first definition my answer to the question posed by the title of my lecture is 'no'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">I would prefer to confine faith, in the sense of unquestioned belief, strictly to the private and religious sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.86,0)">When it comes to central banking neither the central banker's actions nor the public's expectations can afford to just rely on faith devoid of proof or evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, I do not regard it as helpful to characterise central banking as some sort of mystical art that is to instil awe and worship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.45,0)">On the contrary, I consider that the public would be generally ill-advised to put 'blind trust' into particular individuals or institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This is an important lesson to take away from liberal economic and political philosophy as well as from the overwhelming merits of the democratic system of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Ultimately, trust must be earned, it is granted temporarily, it must be checked and it must be backed up by hard evidence, not be based purely on faith or belief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">Second, faith is used in everyday language as a synonym for 'belief', 'reliance' and 'trust', which could perhaps be interpreted in the sense of 'well-founded expectation'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In this context one could think of faith as a probabilistic statement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Immanuel Kant has associated faith with an intermediate degree of certainty, in between mere 'opinion' but short of 'knowledge'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">On this definition my basic answer to the question becomes 'yes'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">At least in the example of the institution I represent, I see good reasons to believe that the public in Europe should and that it can rely on the European Central Bank to fulfil its mandate and maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This sort of 'reasoned faith' or 'confidence' is   underpinned by a sound institutional set-up, the application of well-established economic principles and, last but not least, by the quality and determination of the people dedicated to this task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A third aspect of faith relates to 'keeping a promise' or 'engagement' as in 'acting in good faith', in the sense of reflecting 'honesty of intention'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For Thomas Hobbes 'to have faith', 'to trust' and 'to believe a man' are synonymous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">One could think of this dimension of faith as representing a two-sided relationship, rather than a unilateral act of faith.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">From this perspective faith - or here better: trust - is similar to a contract established between two parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The faith that the public places into the central bank imposes a constant obligation on the central bank to honour this trust and fulfil the promise of stable money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The bond of trust between the public and its central bank can be seen as something like a credit relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, the term 'credit' is Latin for 'he believes', i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">it expresses the hope and expectation that initially one-sided trust will be reciprocated and returned in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Trust is given 'on credit' but in turn it is based on credibility or trustworthiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">If you allow me to jump from these etymological reflections straight to the mundane tasks of central banking in practice I should like to stress the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In the case of European Monetary Union the promise of maintaining prices stable over the medium term - and thus maintaining the value of money - is built on solid and credible institutional foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">So far in its young life the European Central Bank has lived up to its promise and there is every reason to believe that price stability in the euro area will continue to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Long-term bond yields and surveys of inflation expectations continue to indicate a high degree of confidence in the ECB's ability to deliver on its primary objective over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is what ultimately counts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">For this achievement the ECB can deservedly claim some 'credit', if I may say so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the remainder of the lecture I will concentrate mainly on trust and credibility as two aspects of 'faith', which appear most relevant for monetary policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Trust and the quest for credibility are at the core of a monetary economy, the role of central banks in such an economy and the search for an appropriate monetary constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is not to say that there is no room for faith as 'belief based on authority' both in the public perception of central banks and of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Trust: the role of money and the value of price stability One does not have to look very far in order to find a link between faith and money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In fact, every one-dollar bill bears the inscription "In God we trust".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Euro will be more secular in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the case of Sterling, the pound notes feature a "promise to pay the bearer" of the note the amount stated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This points to the very nature of money as being built on trust, on a promise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Trust is crucial for money to function as a medium of exchange, as a store of value and as a stable unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Using economic terminology, money - or rather the trust that underpins the use of money - has public good characteristics or confers positive network externalities on all participants in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">In this way money economises significantly on the costs of transactions that would be present in a pure barter economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">If you look more closely at the dollar bill, you will find a further inscription which states 'This note is legal tender for all debt, public and private'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This imposes an obligation to accept the note in the settlement of contracts and highlights the fact that money derives its value - whether imposed by a legal tender requirement or not - from the willingness of other economic agents to accept it to settle transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Each agent will only accept money, if he can be confident that it will in turn be accepted by other agents in future transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Thus money is a social achievement as has long been recognised by economists for example by Menger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.45,0)">Money is a question of trust, its use requires trust and it reflects trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is especially true in the case of fiat money, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">the use of printed paper - which has no intrinsic worth - as a medium of exchange and as a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Yet even commodity money requires trust and a well-founded expectation that it will be accepted for a wide range of transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Milton Friedman, in his book Money Mischief  , reports the well-known story of the monetary system of a small island in Micronesia which at the end of the 19th century used stone wheels as a medium of exchange and as a store of wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.2,0)">He recounts an episode when the colonial government imposed 'fees' on disobedient district chiefs simply by painting black crosses on these stone wheels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">This miraculously and promptly induced them to change their ways just in order to have these marks erased again and thus - in their perception - their wealth restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Friedman concludes that this example illustrates "how important appearance or illusion or 'myth', given unquestioned belief, becomes in monetary matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Our own money, the money we have grown up with, the system under which it is controlled, these appear 'real' and 'rational' to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.21,0)">Yet the money of other countries often seems to us like paper or worthless metal, even when the purchasing power of individual units is quite high."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The euro has been in existence for almost two years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">It does not come in the form of stone wheels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.77,0)">In fact it does not yet have any concrete and tangible expression at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.64,0)">Until the introduction of euro banknotes and coins at the beginning of 2002 it will essentially remain a 'virtual' currency, which may perhaps seem as remote, unfamiliar and unnatural in the eyes of the public as the stone wheels described by Friedman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">This lack of tangibility and visibility of the euro in part accounts for the particular challenges that the euro faces in winning the hearts of the general public as a new currency which has yet to replace the familiar and trusted national notes and coins in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.81,0)">As Friedman's example shows: symbols may be important in monetary matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">At the same time, irrespective of the particular symbols and media to which money functions are attached - be it stone wheels or computer chips - money is ultimately a question of trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.08,0)">The euro's current existence as a 'non-tangible currency' perhaps makes this point - which is valid for any fiat money - more plain and obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">No matter what specific medium of exchange a society might wish to adopt, the efficiency of money in facilitating economic transactions via the price mechanism depends on its stability as a unit of account, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">as a common financial denominator, for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In order to hold and accept money economic agents must not only be confident that money remains accepted as a medium for exchange, but also be confident that money will retain its value over time, thereby ensuring that price signals can provide accurate guidance for markets to function efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.41,0)">In contrast, if money loses its value, this also undermines its usefulness for exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.84,0)">Indeed in periods of very high inflation currency tends to be replaced, for example, by cigarettes or other goods - or, perhaps, 'bads' - in everyday transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.69,0)">An inflationary currency will simply cease to be accepted in transactions notwithstanding any legal tender provisions such as those written on the dollar bills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I am old enough to remember such a period in post-war Germany, before the currency reform of 1948.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Stable money, stable prices: these are the very foundations of a well-functioning market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">There is a strong economic case for price stability, which today is - again - widely accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, the case for price stability goes beyond the purely economic sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Price stability, the ability to rely on stable money, is the basis for trust in the interaction among economic agents, trust in property rights, trust in society and trust in the future more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Trust in stable money is also the basis for a free society, the ability of people to take decisions and plan their future for themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is particularly evident with respect to life-time savings for retirement, which is a topical issue at the moment in the context of discussions over a greater role for private pension schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Private provision of retirement savings crucially requires the trust of savers in the long-run stability of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.62,0)">Conversely, a loss of such confidence inevitably leads to calls on the state to step in and provide for the future collectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.48,0)">Inflation undermines trust in money and in property rights more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.56,0)">This mechanism was apparently recognised by Lenin who allegedly remarked that the "most effective way to destroy civil society is to destroy its money".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">There is a saying that "peace is not everything, but without peace everything else comes to nothing".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I am tempted to say the same thing for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.93,0)">Inflation - like war, to which it is often closely associated - destroys the fruit of honest labour, it devalues savings and investment, it erodes the social fabric of society and, ultimately, puts the very foundations of democracy and freedom at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.17,0)">This is one of the lessons of the bitter history of the 20th century, which was a century of hyperinflation in the wake of wars and wars in the wake of hyperinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.91,0)">No one has described the deleterious effects of inflation more vividly than Stefan Zweig has done in his book "Die Welt von Gestern" on Germany in the 1920s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.15,0)">He depicts the sense of distrust, despondency, desolation and despair that hyperinflation brought to Germany in 1923   from which the fragile democratic and economic institutions of the young Republic were never really to recover  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.97,0)">Zweig contrasts this with the pre-war "golden age of security", when "it paid to put money year for year in safe investments", when "the saver was not yet robbed", the "honest deceived" but when the "most patient, not the speculators had the greatest profit".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.27,0)">He concludes "that nothing has rendered the German people so embittered, so full of hatred, so ready for Hitler as this inflation"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">From this one could establish not just an economic case but an ethical obligation to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.39,0)">Indeed as far back as the middle ages Nicolaus Oresme has argued in favour of stable money as a principle of natural law and has denounced the debasing of currency by the state as worse than usury and equivalent to robbery and exploitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In our times another bishop, Karl Lehmann, the current chair of the German Conference of Bishops, has stressed a moral and ethical justification of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.96,0)">In line with recent documents of catholic social teaching he emphasises the fact that inflation tends to hit the weakest segments of the population hardest and that it has contributed to impoverishment in particular in developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.85,0)">On the whole, however, the world of faith and the world of money eye each other with a good measure of distrust and suspicion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Men of faith have often regarded money as the symbol of greed, sin and evil rather than as an instrument for mutually beneficial exchange and a foundation of prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.75,0)">The Christian ethical tradition has in particular expressed moral reservations against the trading or lending of money against an interest charge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.08,0)">This sceptical attitude towards money and interest rates, which to an economist is simply the intertemporal price of money, was well-entrenched in the Scholastic tradition and goes back to Aristotle's view that to 'make money out of money' would go against natural law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.82,0)">Interestingly such moral scruples on lending against interest are also found in other religions and this form of lending is banned to this day in the Islamic world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I must admit that, as a central banker charged with setting official interest rates, I have difficulties to accept this particular - to my mind unfounded - belief, even if the authority in question was claimed to be Aristotle or the Bible, both of which I am quite happy to consult on other matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Credibility: the role of rules and institutions The weight of historical experience, a large body of theoretical literature and of empirical evidence point to the importance of price stability as the foundation of a well-functioning market economy and as a precondition for durable growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.16,0)">Nevertheless history is littered with episodes of high inflation which imposed high economic and social costs on society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.62,0)">To be sure, at times the importance of the common and precious good of price stability may have been underrated or forgotten by society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.03,0)">At other times stability may have been purposefully compromised in the pursuit of other seemingly more pressing objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.72,0)">However, the main lesson that I would take away from history is this: when it comes to price stability, good faith and honest intentions are not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Fundamentally, money represents a promise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It requires trust by the users of money in the issuer of money to honour this promise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Money is built on trust, but in turn trust must be built on solid foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">The promise must be made credible and this - at least in relatively modern times - is the job of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A promise always concerns the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.61,0)">As we know when we make promises in everyday life, when the time comes to make good on our promises there is a danger that we find either our mind or the situation having changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.83,0)">Perhaps we might have simply forgotten what we said in the past or would like to change our plans under the pressure of a myriad of more pressing concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is all very human.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.0,0)">It also pretty much describes the core of the much-discussed problem of credibility in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Thus a good monetary constitution that can be expected to durably deliver on the promise of stability needs to take human frailty and imperfection into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">Like elsewhere in public life, in monetary policy one should and cannot simply rely on good intentions, blind trust or unquestioned authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Can we trust central banks and can we expect them to be credible in making good on their promise of price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.43,0)">There is today a broad consensus that stable money it too important to be left to the day-to-day political process, which inevitably will always have to balance different objectives, conflicting interests and short-term pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">If stable money is regarded as a common good for the benefit of all and if it is seen as a precondition for long-term prosperity and social justice then it makes sense for society to create an independent institution that stands above the fray of day-to-day politics and can pursue this objective with minimum distraction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is the basis for central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">If price stability, by contrast, were regarded as just one out of a long list of political and economic objectives -
