    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.85,0)"> “A currency beyond the nation state: The euro and its institutional challenges ahead” Dinner speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at Société d’Economie Politique,Paris, 16 November 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply shocked by what happened here over the weekend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.77,0)">Those atrocious attacks have killed and wounded hundreds of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I would like to express my solidarity, my compassion, and my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Our societies are founded on a social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">A common understanding of fundamental values and principles, such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights, forms the basis for peaceful coexistence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Such a social contract need not be constrained to the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">It can also – and does – exist at the supra-national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is on this basis that, in Europe, Member States share sovereignty, most notably as some of us share a “currency beyond the state”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will: first, lay out the legal scope for sharing sovereignty; and second, elaborate on what this means for further European integration in different policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.05,0)">The Lisbon Treaty sets out several restrictions regarding the transfer of sovereignty from the national to the European level: Sovereignty in the Union rests with the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The Union owes its existence to the Member States, as they confer competences on the Union in order to attain common objectives  ).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.96,0)">National security remains the sole responsibility of the constituent states  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Union is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As you can see, the letter and spirit of the Lisbon Treaty do not suggest that the EU should be transformed into a sovereign state called Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Nevertheless, some national constitutional courts saw the need to further emphasise that Member States remain viable and independent political entities, coining the term “constitutional identity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Constitutional identity assumes that each Member State enjoys the right to democratic self-determination through its own institutions, in particular national parliaments elected by the people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, distinguishing between the original, constituent power of the people and the derived, constituted power of the legislator does not limit the ability to share sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.3,0)">Only a very radical interpretation of constitutional identity would dictate that competences cannot be transferred to another entity without violating the original power of the people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.34,0)">Such an interpretation is based on the antiquated belief that the nation state is the sole locus of legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This belief is rooted in the so-called Westphalian model of international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It assumes that only the nation state has sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This model refers to the Peace of Westphalia – a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in Osnabrück and Münster  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.22,0)">These treaties ended the Thirty Years’ War   in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years’ War  , in which the Kingdom of Spain, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of France, the Swedish Empire and sovereigns of the free imperial cities were also involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The Westphalian model was justified as a means to end the long-lasting wars back in 1648.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.67,0)">However, some 300 years later, after two devastating wars, the dangers of a warped understanding of patriotism, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">nationalism, became apparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Overcoming the limits of the nation state was a precondition for a peaceful Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Sharing sovereignty rather than sacrificing it has been the preferred method of achieving this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Indeed, the European approach since then has shown that democratic states can share sovereignty in a number of policy areas without losing statehood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The EU has developed an identity as a union not only of Member States, but also of citizens establishing a model of transnational democracy with an elected, European Parliament and an independent Court of Justice  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">EU citizens have ample reason to say, as the incoming President of the ECJ, Koen Lenaerts, once put it: Civis Europaeus sum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The Treaty signed by Member States also confers rights to citizenship which can be claimed in the European courts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">In particular, the euro area has shown that like-minded people and their governments can introduce, manage and safeguard a single currency without having to merge into one overarching federal state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.79,0)">The “currency beyond the state”   has revealed as false the widespread belief that a monetary union without a state is not viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">There is a broad consensus that the design and implementation of monetary policy should be taken out of the political arena to protect citizens’ purchasing power from short-term temptations and pressures of the election cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is why monetary policy was transferred to an independent institution, the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">While independent, the ECB is accountable to a democratically elected body, the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Our decisions are taken at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They are taken in the interest of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And – as a logical consequence – they are democratically legitimised at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Currently, this democratic control includes parliamentarians from countries that do not share the currency of the Union, which the Treaty explicitly states as being the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This logic cannot, however, be directly applied to all other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Deciding on taxation and the allocation of budgetary expenditures is the core competence of national parliaments, and for good reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Taxation mirrors the people’s preferences for the supply of public goods and – just as importantly – their willingness to finance these public goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Taxation and the allocation of budgetary expenditures, therefore, requires a high degree of democratic legitimacy and parliamentary control at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The concept of a European taxpayer, briefly discussed during the negotiations leading up to the Maastricht Treaty, did not end up being included in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This is currently a national prerogative, but that does not mean that we should shy away from further fiscal integration in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We just need to get it right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">One of the ideas currently being discussed is a euro area-wide fiscal stabilisation function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This function could help to better cushion the economy against large macroeconomic shocks that cannot be dealt with at the national level alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">For such euro area stabilisation to work, however, we first need a significant degree of economic convergence and financial integration according to the Five Presidents’ Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.08,0)">In any case, a fiscal stabilisation function is meant to be just that: a stabilisation function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It should not be misused to introduce a transfer system through the back door.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A fiscal stabilisation function could be managed by a euro-area treasury that would be responsible for those fiscal policy decisions that are more effectively dealt with at the European level than at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Such a euro area treasury or finance ministry would clearly need a high degree of democratic legitimacy and strong parliamentary control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.22,0)">Any college with powers delegated from intergovernmental forums would hardly satisfy these requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In my view, the European Parliament convening in euro area composition would be the right body to undertake this task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It would ensure that the actions of a European finance minister are legitimised at the same level at which decisions are taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A high degree of democratic legitimacy also implies that a European finance minister cannot be an unelected technocrat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.48,0)">Under the current institutional framework, he or she certainly cannot be a delegate from the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.17,0)">In an integrated Union, this informal, intergovernmental body lacks its raison d’être.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Could a delegate from the European Commission assume this position?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In principle, yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">With the election of its President and the vetting of Commissioners by the European Parliament, the European Commission enjoys a higher degree of democratic legitimacy than various intergovernmental gatherings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.59,0)">However, the Commission is increasingly experiencing tensions between its ever-more political orientation and its role as the guardian of the Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">These tensions would need to be solved first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.65,0)">And a “Spitzenkandidat” is not an elected President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Any such moves towards closer fiscal integration will need time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some of them require treaty changes for which I currently do not see political willingness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Given the urgency of the crisis, the minimum consensus was therefore to temporarily opt for intergovernmental arrangements to increase the Union’s resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">This ought to be a temporary solution to avoid tensions of a political and legal nature between community and intergovernmental institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For instance, the European Stability Mechanism   was established as an intergovernmental institution that, for tasks such as payments, still requires prior consent from national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As soon as there is political willingness to change the treaties, the ESM should be made a proper European institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.54,0)">In the longer run the intergovernmental approach is a dead end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me conclude by summarising my main point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">While legal doctrine is important and necessary, it needs to be free of ideological interference and must not be used for purposes that go beyond its legal nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.88,0)">If national courts claim the right to defend national sovereign prerogatives over and above the decisions of their democratically elected representatives, the legal doctrine of “constitutional identity” morphs into a political question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.04,0)">There is then a risk that sovereignty becomes an ideological concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.77,0)">Such “sovereignism” clashes with any attempt at further European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.94,0)">It could result in a failure to complete the European integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It should not be used as an excuse to opt for intergovernmental arrangements where supranational solutions would be more conducive to achieving a genuine Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The European integration process has demonstrated that democratic states can share sovereignty in a number of policy areas without losing statehood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Nevertheless, we need to take into account that some policy areas do need a higher degree of democratic legitimacy and parliamentary control at the national level than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This reasoning in no way supports those championing a national or constitutional identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.16,0)">Rather, it illustrates the need for different approaches to the respective policy areas, especially as the concept of constitutional identity has not only hampered deeper integration but risks winding back earlier achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">As Jaap Hoeksma, philosopher of law put it, “the transition of the EU from an international organisation to a European democracy has proceeded faster than most euro-sceptics” predicted; at the same time, “the quality of this   democracy   needs more improvements than euro enthusiasts tend to assume”.</span><span
