    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)"> The International Dimension of Monetary Policy Introductory speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, 28 June 2016 In recent years central banks across advanced economies have been engaged in the same task, namely raising inflation and inflation expectations back to levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.01,0)">Each has faced conditions particular to its own jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Each has deployed measures appropriate to its own context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And each has acted to fulfil the mandate laid down in its own constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And yet, the fact that all central banks have faced a common challenge of low inflation is not coincidental.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There are global factors at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And this begs the question, what is the best way for us to deal with them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">At one extreme, central banks can take global conditions as entirely exogenous and set their policies accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">At the other extreme is explicit coordination of monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In between is a range of informal solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Whatever one’s views on these options, what is clear is that the question of the international dimension of monetary policy is becoming more pertinent, since the common factors affecting central banks are increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The global drivers of inflation Indeed, a growing literature suggests that globalisation has created a common factor in inflation developments, which goes beyond fluctuations in energy or commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Higher import volumes have increased the importance of international prices and wages relative to domestic ones, making the global output gap more relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.88,0)">In that context there are two types of factors that are significant for the global low inflation environment we face today: more cyclical factors that have put downward pressure on prices; and more structural factors that have lowered the equilibrium real rate and slowed down the response of the economy to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.88,0)">The first type of factors includes the large negative output gaps generated by the financial crisis and its aftermath, which still average 1% among G7 economies today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.54,0)">This global slack has dampened in particular import and producer price inflation, both of which have been weak for several years among advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Prices set by producers in the euro area and those set by producers in trading partner countries are indeed highly correlated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.05,0)">Also depressing global inflation has been the slump in demand for energy and commodities linked to the slowdown in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This has fed not just into lower headline inflation, but also into lower underlying inflation through its effect on costs and imported prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Indeed, if one decomposes inflation for the average advanced economy, one finds that since mid-2014 there has been a notable rise in the global component, linked largely to oil and commodity price falls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">These various factors may originate only in parts of the global economy – some originate more in advanced economies, other more in emerging markets – but in an integrated world they have global effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Cyclical weakness has spilled over through various channels into a similar challenge for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.19,0)">The second type of factors is more structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.68,0)">They concern the global forces that have led to very low real equilibrium interest rates across advanced economies, and hence made it more complicated for monetary policy everywhere to provide the appropriate boost to global demand given an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.7,0)">In particular, this has led many central banks in the advanced economies to engage in large-scale unconventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.03,0)">That low interest rate environment is a consequence of a global excess of desired saving over planned investment, which results from rising net savings as populations plan for retirement; from increased demand for and lower supply of safe assets; from relatively less public capital expenditure in a context of slowing population growth in advanced economies; from the secular shift from industries intensive in physical capital to those more intensive in human capital; and from a slowdown in productivity growth that reduces returns on investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Again, those factors may not be distributed homogenously across economies, but their effects are global because they propagate through global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">With internationally mobile capital, the clearing interest rate that balances saving and investment is more a global concept than a local one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.74,0)">And accordingly, estimates of the equilibrium interest rate suggest that it is very low, possibly even negative, in the euro area, the US and other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">None of this means that central banks should give up on pursuing their domestic price stability mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We have demonstrated with our unconventional tools that it is possible to engineer accommodative financial conditions even when the equilibrium interest rate is low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And we have shown that this can be effective in supporting domestic demand and stoking domestic price pressures even when disinflationary headwinds are blowing from the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But the global nature of low inflation does have two important implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.83,0)">Coping with monetary policy spillovers The first is that operating against persistent headwinds arising from abroad has forced central banks to deploy monetary policy with more intensity to deliver their mandates, and that in turn results in higher financial stability risks and spillovers to economic and financial conditions in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.33,0)">Such spillovers are not necessarily all negative for the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">On the contrary, by securing economic and financial stability in their own jurisdictions, advanced economies also help stabilise other economies through trade and financial linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The empirical evidence suggests that the net spillover effect of the measures taken during the crisis has been positive, especially at times – such as after the Lehman crash – when countries have faced common global shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.71,0)">At the same time, monetary policy has inevitably created destabilising spillovers as well, especially when business cycles have been less aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The large exchange rates fluctuations between major currencies, and the pressures some emerging economies have experienced from capital flows, are testament to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">This is not so much a result of the measures central banks have employed , but rather of the intensity with which they have had to be used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">These negative spillovers have led to a revival of interest in the topic of monetary policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.46,0)">But formal monetary policy coordination is complex, for well-known reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">Central banks have national mandates, not global ones, and are accountable to their domestic parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This does not mean, however, that we cannot achieve a better global solution than we have today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.09,0)">We have seen, for instance, how divergent monetary policies among major central banks can create uncertainty about future policy intentions, which in turn leads to higher exchange rate volatility and risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">That then has to be countered with more expansionary monetary policy, increasing spillover effects for others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.1,0)">We also know that competitive devaluations are lose-lose for the global economy, since they lead only to greater market volatility, to which other central banks are then forced to react to defend their domestic mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">So we would all clearly benefit from enhanced understanding among central banks on the relative paths of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">That comes down, above all, to improving communication over our reaction functions and policy frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The global economy could also benefit from cooperation among spillover-initiating and spillover-receiving economies on how to mitigate unwanted side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One aspect that we need to understand better is how domestic monetary regimes affect the transmission of foreign monetary policy shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.96,0)">There has been a debate in recent years as to whether the famous “trilemma” of international macro has collapsed into a “dilemma”, whereby floating exchange rates no longer guarantee autonomy for domestic monetary policy, and policy independence is only possible if capital flows are in fact managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But there is also evidence that exchange rate regimes still matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Various recent studies support the traditional view that exchange rate flexibility affords at least some degree of insulation from global shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Another aspect is understanding the role of domestic policies more broadly in mitigating negative spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">A large body of empirical work in recent years has shown that fiscal, macro-prudential, regulatory and supervisory policies can help mitigate the adverse effects of foreign monetary policy on domestic financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.44,0)">Indeed, the experience with the taper tantrum in 2013 showed how differences in domestic policy frameworks shaped how severely different economies were affected by financial spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In other words, it has become clearer since the crisis that the famous “Tinbergen principle” which we apply at the domestic level also needs to be applied at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Policymakers need to have sufficient instruments to deliver on their objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.39,0)">And when they do have them, they must use them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The need for policy alignment The second implication of the global nature of low inflation is that there is a common responsibility for addressing its sources, whatever and wherever their origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Indeed, to the extent that the environment in which we operate is more affected by the global output gap, and the global savings-investment balance, the speed with which monetary policy can achieve domestic goals inevitably becomes more dependent on others – on the success of authorities in other jurisdictions to also close their domestic output gaps; and on our collective ability to tackle the secular drivers of global saving and investment imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In a recent speech in Brussels I made a similar point regarding the interaction between monetary policy and other policies at the domestic level, such as fiscal and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">I maintained that central bank independence could best be described as independence in interdependence, since monetary policy can always achieve its objective eventually, but it will do so faster, and with less collateral effects, if the overall policy mix is consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What I am saying here is that the same applies at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We may not need formal coordination of policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">But we can benefit from alignment of policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">What I mean by alignment is a shared diagnosis of the root causes of the challenges that affect us all; and a shared commitment to found our domestic policies on that diagnosis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Today, for instance, the way in which domestic policies respond to a shortage of demand globally will vary: in some cases, the emphasis may be on increasing public investment; in others, on supporting private demand through more growth-friendly tax and regulatory policy, and of course through monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The relative stance of stabilisation policies will differ across countries depending on cyclical positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">But the sign of the effect on global demand needs to be positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Similarly, structural policies that aim at raising participation and productivity may take different forms in different places, but they need to achieve the same outcome, which is to increase long-term growth rates and raise equilibrium interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Here fora such as the G-20 can play an essential role in bringing about the appropriate alignment of policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is key that what is agreed in those fora is translated in the concrete policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.92,0)">The disappointing outcome of the G-20 commitment to raise global growth by 2% with structural measures is one example of how intentions and actions can diverge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">It contrasts with the more successful example that was provided by coordinated global fiscal expansion in 2008-09.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.76,0)">Such fora of course cannot bind countries into specific actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But mutual recognition of their common interest can act as a form of coordination device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">That common interest today is a faster closing of the global output gap, more stable global inflation, higher long-term global growth and greater global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">And such an improved policy mix would help reduce unwanted side effects of monetary policy, since the burden of stabilisation would be better shared across policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For instance, in the current environment of global slack, the international spillovers from growth-friendly fiscal policies are likely to be wholly positive, since they primarily boost domestic demand in the home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">That is also true within regions, such as the euro area, where there are different local output gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The upshot is that, in a globalised world, the global policy mix matters – and will likely matter more as our economies become more integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">So we have to think not just about whether our domestic monetary policies are appropriate, but whether they are properly aligned across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">We have to think not just about the composition of policies within our jurisdictions, but about the global composition that can maximise the effects of monetary policy so that our respective mandates can best be delivered without overburdening further monetary policy, and so as to limit any destabilising spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">This is not a preference or a choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is simply the new reality we face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">Inflation as a global phenomenon has been documented e.g.</span><span
