    <h1> Revisiting the European social contract </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the European Conference at Harvard Europe 2.0 - Taking The Next Step, Cambridge MA, 2 March 2013 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)"> Revisiting the European social contract Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the European Conference at HarvardEurope 2.0 - Taking The Next Step,Cambridge MA, 2 March 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is a great pleasure to attend the European Conference at Harvard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will argue in my remarks that the management of the current crisis is at least as much about social stabilisation as it is about economic stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">At the heart of the crisis, there is the challenge of redefining the social contract to safeguard the sustainability of Europe’s social economy model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">This model, set out in the Maastricht Treaty, notably aims to promote “social justice”, “solidarity between generations” and “solidarity among Member States”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In my view, in order to ensure the sustainability of the social contract and to fulfil its promises both at national and European level, we need three elements:   a broad consensus on the definition of fairness, the forms of solidarity and the conditions attached to it;   an institutional architecture ensuring its legitimacy and stability; and   effective policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">As I will strive to show, a redefinition of the social contract in Europe is essential if we are to restore the sustainability of public policies as well as trust in the state’s ability to positively influence economic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In other words, it is a matter of enhancing the sustainability of national social contracts in a reshaped European framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.93,0)">Such an evolution will inevitably change the organisation and role of the state, as well as the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">But this does not mean moving away from the concept of the European social market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It means preserving it and consolidating it for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.52,0)">Threats to the European social contract The Great Recession – as it is often called – did not just have dire consequences for the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.41,0)">It also resulted in a threat to social cohesion, straining the social contract in its different dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.95,0)">The economic crisis has disproportionately affected the more vulnerable social groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">Low-skilled and young workers were the hardest hit, with a youth unemployment rate of more than 24% in January 2013 in the euro area as a whole  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.2,0)">There are signs of a growing mismatch between worker attributes and job requirements across a number of euro area countries, consistent with an outward shift in the aggregate euro area Beveridge curve – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.08,0)">a higher level of unemployment is associated with a given level of vacancies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Future growth depends on human capital being cultivated and expanded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.19,0)">That is threatened if too many workers remain unemployed for too long and lose their employability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.99,0)">The fiscal crisis has also endangered solidarity between generations by calling into question the ability of governments to raise enough revenues to afford the services they provide to the older generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.52,0)">Finally, the crisis is exerting visible strains on the relationship among the people of Europe, with nationalist temptations that do not help to achieve a consensus on cooperative solutions or to allow a return to stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">A rebalancing is inevitable and is now under way, but it is taking its toll.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.31,0)">The longer that rebalancing takes, the higher the social costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">So it is crucial that a sense of urgency is maintained both at national and at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">The national level is still central to the definition of the social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">We recognise explicitly those common values and sought to have them reflected in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">They include freedom, peace, democracy, tolerance and – vital from a social perspective – solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.08,0)">Upholding those values faces similar challenges across the continent, in particular the sustainability of public policies, which are an expression of the social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Europe is also a political union: the social contract exists both within countries and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The EU can in fact be regarded as perhaps the most ambitious example of the philosophical theories that underpin the social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As Thomas Hobbes remarked in his Leviathan  , sovereign states are established to regulate social interactions and avoid the “war of all against all” that would prevail without the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.87,0)">States, however, compete with each other and therefore may even resort to arms in the absence of a supranational body imposing social contract laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">As was recognised by the Nobel Peace Prize, the European project was the key to ensuring that European states would move from war to peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">States, in Europe, pursued Kant’s dream of constitutionalising international law to achieve lasting peace  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.13,0)">The doubts I mentioned above, as well as some stirrings of nationalism and protectionism, show that this dream is today at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.48,0)">The social contract needs revisiting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The EU and, to an even larger extent, the euro area have gone beyond a combination of political and economic freedoms with a set of common rules and policies regulating the internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As a result, the EU and the euro area have started evolving from a microeconomic and legal construct to a fully-fledged economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.69,0)">The European social contract and the national social contracts thus no longer only complement each other: decisions at European level are having an increasing impact on national economic, social and political outcomes, while the externalities of national decisions are also getting larger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In this context, the relationship between the European and national social contracts needs careful consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It can no longer rely on a “permissive consensus” and must rest on an institutional architecture that is both effective and legitimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Moreover, as people increasingly see the impact of policy decisions with European relevance on individual outcomes, it needs to be emphasised that they – and not only the Member States – are partners in the European social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The contract will therefore need to involve citizens as much as Member States by making European political institutions more accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.18,0)">And the absence of a European demos cannot justify opposition to this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.36,0)">Political fragmentation is the outcome, as much as it is the cause, of an impaired social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.1,0)">The sustainability imperative John Maynard Keynes famously said: “The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.91,0)">In the long run we are all dead”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And yet societies live in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Today’s choices influence tomorrow’s outcomes, just as yesterday’s decisions affect today’s situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is even truer in a low-growth, low- interest-rate environment, which increases the discounted value of tomorrow’s costs and benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The importance of the long run was widely shown by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.77,0)">It was doubt about the accumulation and sustainability of debt which caused Greece and then Ireland and Portugal to lose access to markets and which associated the same risk with other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.58,0)">And it is doubt about the stability of the political system as well as its ability to adopt legitimate, effective and sustainable public policies that worries citizens in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.18,0)">This accumulation of debt has taken the form of financial asset bubbles and/or a drift in public debt, depending on the Member State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.51,0)">Warnings on the long-run sustainability of public finances were legion long before the crisis erupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.19,0)">The build-up of untenable promises is not unique to Europe: the gap between public spending and nominal GDP growth was even larger in the US and Japan – where the average growth rate in government spending exceeded the average nominal GDP growth rate by 1½ and 2 percentage points respectively – than in the euro area, where this difference only amounted to around one-quarter of a percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.54,0)">In this sense, the crisis propelled us 20 years into the future: it revealed the unsustainable character of the unchecked accumulation of excessive liabilities in the private and public sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It forces us to confront challenges today that we thought we had more time to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.13,0)">It has made the challenge even more daunting by debasing the pool of wealth that can be tapped to fund the social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.19,0)">IMF projections for growth in advanced economies incorporate marked-down estimates for potential output relative to pre-crisis trends by 10% or more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Such debasing calls for even bolder action to restore sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this respect, a central bank can help to mitigate the impact of the crisis, but the steps it takes cannot be a permanent substitute for resolute action by governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.05,0)">The central bank can buy time for political bodies to act, but it cannot buy enough time for them not to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In the crisis, the ECB’s continued commitment to price stability and the integrity of the euro has been one of the few elements of certainty in a highly volatile and uncertain environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This commitment to monetary stability is not only grounded in its economic merits but is also a cornerstone of the social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It protects poorer households from the dire effects of inflation on purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">It ensures that no redistribution of wealth takes place that is unsanctioned by democratic processes, which is exactly what inflation does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">And it buttresses political stability by avoiding the social unrest that unchecked inflation can cause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.35,0)">Yet buying time is not indefinitely affordable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.25,0)">There is a cost to any delay in reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.4,0)">For as long as entry barriers hinder competition, as long as scarce budgetary resources are not channelled to support job creation and innovation, and as long as the burden of adjustment is disproportionately borne by the weakest in the society, these rigidities will not allow any rebasing of growth on a sustainable footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Just as long-term issues caused short-term problems, it is only by working on stabilising our economies and societies over the long term under an agreed contract that EU members will return to sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Formulating a vision of our common future, rooted in democratic deliberation, is an urgent priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It will provide an anchor for, and will enhance both the efficiency and legitimacy of, actions to confront the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Last December’s “Four Presidents’ report” on the future of Economic and Monetary Union provides a blueprint for such a long-term vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.91,0)">Rebalancing the social contract As political institutions are facing tough choices now because of the unsustainable policies of the past, the question of the distribution of the adjustment burden has become key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It implies a redefinition of the social contract both at national level and at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">What is at stake is nothing less than the sustainability of the European social market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">Within countries The social contract first needs to be rebalanced within each country along two dimensions: between generations and within generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.66,0)">Excessive liabilities, even if supported by the market, imply a transfer of wealth from future generations to the current ones – a move that is decided unilaterally by the current generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.47,0)">Likewise, stronger prudential rules are not a restriction on credit for productive investment, but a check on excessive risk-taking that would otherwise lead to financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">On the fiscal front, effectively balancing the social contract between generations means creating room for stabilising policies in future downturns and protecting the coming generations by forcing the distributional debate to take place in the present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This balancing act focuses on the quality of public expenditures and implies that deficits are justified only to the extent that they deliver sufficient returns in terms of future fiscal revenues  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">On the financial front, redefining the social contract between generations means realigning today’s incentives so that tomorrow’s fiscal policy is not threatened by financial dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.28,0)">Bailing out banks with taxpayers’ money is indeed both unfair and a factor of moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">A closer link therefore needs to be restored between the responsibility that arises out of excessive leverage and the costs associated with deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.1,0)">The social contract also needs to be rebalanced between the generations alive today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There is ample room for a debate on the distributional impact of fiscal and economic decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Fairness, a concept which has a particular resonance in this university thanks to John Rawls  , is a legitimate objective: solidarity can help to ensure that economic progress for the many is not achieved at the expense of impoverishing the least fortunate households or depriving them of their right to equal opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">A reduction of rents and entry barriers, which notably disadvantage younger men and women on the labour market, is in that sense fully consistent with the objective of fairness, while also making the economy more competitive by setting the right incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.24,0)">National social contracts will continue to differ depending on the distributional choices made by each constituency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">But Europeans now have to recognise that such choices need to be fully in line with the sustainability imperative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">Across countries What does the social contract mean at European level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Here again, there are two dimensions to consider: a horizontal and a vertical dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The horizontal dimension concerns the rights held and responsibilities borne by each Member State vis-à-vis its partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The vertical dimension concerns the contract that exists between individual citizens and the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Both need to be redefined in the light of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The European social contract primarily binds all Member States of the European Union in the pursuit of the EU’s objectives, as laid down in the Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I will focus here on another and even more demanding contract, the one that binds the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.97,0)">Sharing a single currency creates tight links between markets and a high potential for contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">This means that, at the horizontal level between euro area members, there is an obligation to respect what Isaiah Berlin called the concept of “negative liberty” – to conduct economic policies individually within limits that do not impinge upon the liberty of the other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There is another obligation to establish institutions and instruments that preserve the stability of the system taken as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">This is an implicit social contract which, before the crisis, was believed to be largely self-enforcing – if not by countries themselves, then by the discipline of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.42,0)">That this assumption was misplaced is now part of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So it is now clear that the contract between states has to be enforced more explicitly, by a stronger “neutral judge”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">If there are to be open markets and a shared currency between countries, there also have to be stronger common rules – and a stronger European Commission to enforce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The strengthening of the euro area governance framework that has taken place in recent years is based on this understanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.94,0)">The rules governing fiscal sustainability have become tougher, with more powers given to the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For instance, the new fiscal compact requires all Member States to run a balanced budget over the cycle, similar to the responsibility of individual states in this country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">Under the recently adopted “two-pack” legislation, the Commission will have to sign off on national budgets before they are approved by parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.27,0)">This is a more intrusive role than the US federal government has vis-à-vis the states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Fiscal policies are at the centre of the contract because trust in the currency requires trust in the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.86,0)">Prolonged fiscal profligacy results in an impotent central bank and a debased currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.91,0)">But the social contract is not only about fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As the founding fathers of the euro very well understood, there is no monetary union without an economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But to a certain extent, this aspect of the social contract between Member States was always understood, just not respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.09,0)">Why should it be different now?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.05,0)">The crisis is one explanation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But it is also the case that the incentives for Member States to abide by and enforce the rules have fundamentally changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.99,0)">Before the crisis, the ultimate punishment for unsound national policies was believed to be default, in line with the principle of “no bail-out” enshrined in the EU Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.44,0)">But we have seen during the crisis that the mere prospect of euro area countries failing creates negative and possibly self-fulfilling feedback loops, at great cost to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Without a European budget with a stabilising role, there have to be mechanisms for mutual support in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">And as a condition, there have to be stronger economic governance and mutual control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The basic premise of the new social contract between euro area countries, then, is that countries have to abide by the rules of the community, and when they do, they become eligible for mutual support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Euro area governments have earmarked €700 billion for countries that get into difficulty, a sum which can be lent against strong conditionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">And we are now seeing this concept being further developed before countries get into difficulty via the new idea of “reform contracts”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Countries can decide to undertake difficult structural reforms and receive financial incentives in return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This benefits both parties to the contract by preserving the national character of the decision, while protecting the wider euro area by reducing long-term risks emanating from misguided economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">However, a binding contract between Member States is only needed where national preferences still play a strong role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.76,0)">For instance, it is necessary to work through reform contracts because countries have different approaches when it comes to labour relations or unemployment benefits, based on their own histories and cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But where national preferences play a weaker role, it makes sense to shift policies straight to the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">Then we do not need to set rules and create incentives, because decisions are out of the hands of national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is the vertical dimension of the social contract in Europe that I mentioned earlier – directly between the European level and the ordinary citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Examples of this direct relationship include the regulatory roles of the EU: protecting people from the negative effects of monopolies, regulating against harmful products, and negotiating suitable trade agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The EU also plays a role in redistributing resources from richer to poorer regions through the cohesion funds, although these amount to only 0.36% of the Union’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.4,0)">Where the social contract between the European Union and its citizens needs to be reformed is in three areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, as I already noted, where there is a role for national preferences, there is still a role for Europe to monitor national reform processes, facilitate policy learning and mobilise European instruments   in support of national policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, those policies that belong naturally at European level should be placed there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The clearest example of this is the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is obvious that banks within a single currency area should be governed by the same rules, supervised in a consistent way, and wound up, if necessary, without pushing individual sovereigns into bankruptcy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is also the best way to avoid the cost of financial sector excesses falling on taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This arrangement would also include the stabilisation mechanisms, such as the ESM, needed to ensure that the single currency area can resist extraordinary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In addition, it could include, one day, common financial instruments, provided that control is exerted by the European level over national budgets, under the scrutiny of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This leads me to the third area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The EU needs to find ways to improve its legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.34,0)">People in Europe generally feel disconnected from EU decision-making and question whether their voice is being heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.91,0)">The “European public space” is notably underdeveloped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.53,0)">Decision-making has become more intergovernmental in the crisis, often bypassing the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">And this democratic deficit will only be exacerbated as the European level gains new powers in the ways I described above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In other words, if we are to strengthen fiscal, financial and economic union in Europe, we have to strengthen political union as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">We already have a significant degree of political union in Europe – after all, we have been building the EU for more than 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have a European Parliament, which is directly elected on a proportional basis, like the House of Representatives here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We have a Council of Ministers, which represents the individual Member States, like the Senate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And increasingly, we see that national parliaments are becoming more and more involved in EU decision-making, for instance, by conducting greater scrutiny of Europe’s crisis management or the content of European legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.17,0)">The problem comes from the fact that these bodies are not seen as coherent by citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.54,0)">People do not know who really represents them in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.57,0)">Is it their Prime Minister?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.74,0)">Is it their Member of the European Parliament?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">Is it their local representative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.38,0)">Instead, they see a process controlled by elites with no truly democratic credentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And this is, in fact, far from the truth: as I just showed, there are many ways in which elected representatives are involved in European decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The social contract between the EU and its citizens needs to be rebalanced therefore in various ways: by connecting people more directly with the political process at European level; by making the European Parliament more relevant to peoples’ lives; by giving national parliaments a more explicit role in holding European decision-makers to account; and by airing the debates on the future of Europe more
