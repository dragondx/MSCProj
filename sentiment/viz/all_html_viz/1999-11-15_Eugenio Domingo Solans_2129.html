    <h3> Speaker: Eugenio Domingo Solans </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)"> The euro and the activities of the European Central Bank Speech delivered by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the luncheon conference organised by the Money Matters Institute and The European Institute at the Boston Harbor Hotel, Boston, 15 November 1999 It is a real pleasure for me to participate in this event organised by the Money Matters Institute and The European Institute here in Boston.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Allow me to give you some background information about the launch of the euro, the Eurosystem's monetary policy priorities and orientation and several issues in connection with other activities of the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The launch of the euro On 1 January 1999 ten currencies of eleven European countries merged into the euro, the single European currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This has been the most important step in the process of the European economic and political integration, which began almost fifty years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Eleven European countries have denationalised their currencies, have supranationalised them and have, therefore, transferred the task of conducting a common monetary policy to a new institution called the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Eurosystem is the name given to the ECB, which is the hub of the system, plus the eleven national central banks of the euro area countries, the countries which have introduced the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The birth of the euro was the culmination of a long period of preparation involving a process of fiscal consolidation, exchange rate realignments among European currencies, large organisational and legal changes in the national central banks to achieve their full independence and to prepare for the implementation of the common monetary policy, and important new technical developments in the fields of payment and information systems and statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All these tasks were carried out by the national governments and the national central banks in close co-operation with the European Monetary Institute  , the forerunner of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Above all, the final success in setting up the European System of Central Banks   and launching the euro was possible because of the existence of a clear political conviction that the project was necessary for Europe and that it would eventually succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ESCB consists of the Eurosystem and the four national central banks which have not yet joined European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The policy objectives of the ESCB The Treaty on European Union or Maastricht Treaty states that "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability" and adds that "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Among others, these Community objectives are "sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment" and "a high level of employment and of social protection".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is, therefore, clear that the ECB must focus its decisions, as a matter of priority, on the objective of stability which is its real "raison d'Ãªtre"; in addition, and without prejudice to this aim of stability, the ECB also has responsibilities relating to economic growth, employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">These responsibilities are general, conditional and secondary, if you like, but responsibilities nevertheless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Thus, it seems clear that beyond the primary objective of price stability, the ECB also has an implicit secondary objective: to support the other economic policies and, in doing so, to contribute to economic growth, and to reach a high level of employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">If we accept more than one general objective for monetary policy, it seems important to stress the need to prioritise these objectives and, in the case of the Eurosystem, to give top priority to the objective of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is in contrast with the framework of the American Federal Reserve which has more than one objective at the same level under US law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.21,0)">We understand that any doubt about the priority given to stability could undermine the confidence of the public and the markets in the Eurosystem's performance, trigger inflationary expectations, and eventually - and paradoxically - hinder or jeopardise economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In the medium term, the best contribution that the ECB can make in favour of sustained economic growth is, precisely, to create an environment, an atmosphere of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Stability implies efficient allocation of resources, competitiveness, lower interest rate risk premiums, higher investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">All these factors are preconditions for economic growth or, in other words, preconditions for the fulfilment of the secondary objective of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">In securing stability, the Eurosystem creates the necessary conditions to comply with the European Union's objective of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There is clearly no greater fertiliser for economic growth than price stability, and nothing is more refractory to economic growth than inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">Stability is a concept rather than a single figure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Any price increase is compatible with the concept of stability, as long as it is low or short-lasting enough so as not to cause distortions in price-setting  , and low or short-lasting enough so as not to require the implementation of a general indexation procedure  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.39,0)">The ECB understands that this is the case when the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area as a whole stays below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The present inflation figure of 1.2% for the euro area complies with this definition of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.47,0)">Why below 2%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">This limit is, of course, a convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It could be 2.5% instead, just the same as one could set the speed limit at 90 kmph instead of 80 kmph.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But, on the other hand, stability cannot be defined as an increase in prices of, say, up to 4%, just as 160 kmph is not a real speed limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The substance underlying the 2% stability limit is that price increases should take measurement bias into account  , it should allow variations in relative prices in economies with rather inflexible prices and wages on the downward side, and it should be low enough so as to avoid distortions in price-setting and make any general indexation process unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Following our example, the limit must take into account the lack of precision of the car's speedometer, it must make it possible to overtake other vehicles safely and discourage reckless driving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Taking for granted that the previous conditions are fulfilled   and that, therefore, stability exists, the ECB's monetary policy has room for manoeuvre to create the best monetary conditions in order to support the general economic policies of the European Union and, in particular, to create the best monetary conditions for exploiting the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The general orientation of the ECB's monetary policy In this context, let me say a few words about the general orientation of the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We understand that it should be a medium term-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.2,0)">Its short-term anti-cyclic effects - if any exist - are very limited and have to do with the influence on the confidence and expectations of economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.43,0)">The medium term, lags, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.82,0)">are factors linked to the "mechanical" channels of transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Short term and "activism" are closely linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.44,0)">No one can expect "activism" from the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Our monetary policy is primarily intended to provide a general framework, a general environment, a general atmosphere of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In doing so, it creates the best conditions for economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, the responsibility for fostering economic growth and job creation remains in the hands of the economic policy of the national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Provided that stability exists, in connection with the implicit secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies of the European Union, the monetary policy of the Eurosystem contributes to creating the economic conditions which are essential for exploiting the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, let me stress that it does so in a passive way, without any activism: like the air we breathe, rather than air from an oxygen tank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Fresh air as opposed to air from an oxygen tank: this is my metaphor to compare the passive monetary policy of the ECB with an active one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">My President, Wim Duisenberg, has another, which has to do with television.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">In this case, activism means engaging in "zapping" instead of, I would imagine, sitting quietly watching the film and waiting to discover that - oh surprise!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.29,0)">- the butler is the murderer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The metaphors of one's President are always better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.83,0)">Being passive does not necessarily prevent our monetary policy from having anti-cyclic or a-cyclic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.87,0)">Anti-cyclic and counter-cyclic do not mean exactly the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy does not try to counter every cyclical fluctuation, but it helps to prevent pronounced cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">It smoothes economic waves; it extends the economic wavelength and, by doing so, creates the conditions for sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Other competences of the Eurosystem The introduction of the euro implies a transfer of central banking competence from the national to the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This refers not only to monetary policy but also to exchange rate policy, the conduct of foreign exchange operations, the holding and management of foreign reserves, the promotion of the smooth functioning of payment systems, the stability of the financial system, the development of a European monetary and financial statistical basis, the co-ordination of the production and issuance of banknotes, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">Monetary policy and related central banking tasks are an exclusive competence of the Eurosystem, while exchange rate policy is a shared responsibility of the ECOFIN Council   and the Eurosystem, and banking supervision is a national competence, to which the Eurosystem contributes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Other economic policies, for example fiscal policies or supply-side policies, remain largely a national responsibility, although enhanced co-ordination is ensured, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.87,0)">The external representation of the euro area Depending on whether economic policies are formulated at the Community or the national level, the external representation of the euro area is organised differently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The single monetary policy implies that the ECB represents the euro area externally on matters related to the Eurosystem's tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">The participation of the Eurosystem's national central banks varies depending on the fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.03,0)">For instance, the ECB alone represents the Eurosystem at ECOFIN Council and Euro-11 meetings, whereas national central banks participate, together with the President of the ECB, in the informal ECOFIN Council meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.5,0)">By Euro-11 we mean the Council of the Economic and Finance Ministers of the eleven euro area countries, and not the fifteen European Union Countries which meet in the ECOFIN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.54,0)">Difficulties in devising the appropriate arrangements for the external representation of the euro area by the Eurosystem arise from two specific features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">First, membership of different fora   varies across euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">And second, intergovernmental institutions such as the International Monetary Fund   or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development   are organised on a strictly one currency, one country basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This implies that specific arrangements for the external representation of the euro area had to be devised in each case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Formal and informal agreements have already been reached with the IMF, the OECD and the BIS, as well as in the G7 and G10 context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In December 1998, the ECB was granted Permanent Observer status at the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This was a particularly important step given that the IMF plays a key role in the process of multilateral surveillance of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">The President of the ECB also participates in the Interim Committee of the IMF as an observer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">A similar agreement was reached with the OECD last February with the understanding that the ECB would be allowed to participate in the work of relevant committees and working groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a result, the ECB is a member of the European Community delegation to these meetings in its own right, alongside the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Finally, since 8 November 1999, the ECB is a member and shareholder of the BIS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.74,0)">Regarding the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the President of the ECB is the sole representative of the Eurosystem for discussions on monetary policy and exchange rate issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">This part of G7 meetings is also attended by the Presidency of the Euro-11 Group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The euro and the international monetary system The creation of the euro represents one of the most profound changes in the international monetary world in the last few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The main reasons are twofold: First, the euro is the currency of an economic area with a population of nearly 300 million people and one-sixth of the world's gross domestic product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">After the US dollar, but ahead of the Japanese yen, the euro is the second most widely used currency in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Second, the institutional changes brought about by the euro have made it possible for Europeans to speak for the first time with one voice on monetary and financial matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">By reducing the number of key players in the International Monetary System, the euro will contribute to simplifying international policy co-operation between the major regional blocs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">It will make this process more efficient by facilitating the exchange of information and the ability to reach consensus on worldwide issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Each of the main partners - the United States, the euro area and Japan - is now in a position to speak for a relatively large economic region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The euro as an international currency If one looks at the economic literature that analyses the prerequisites for a currency to acquire an international role, the euro appears to fulfil them all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Namely, it is the currency of a large area, there are no exchange rate controls in the euro area and monetary stability is guaranteed, being the ECB's single objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Having said that, the Eurosystem does not actively promote an international role for the euro, nor do we seek to hinder it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is and shall be no policy of challenging the position of the US dollar, nor that of any other currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The euro will increasingly be a leading international currency with the US dollar and not against it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">By adopting this neutral stance, the development of the euro into an international currency is left to market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">If the Eurosystem is successful in maintaining price stability it will almost automatically foster the euro's international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It is difficult to predict precisely at what pace the euro will increase its international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If history is any guide, it may well be a rather gradual process, although I would not rule out that this time it may well evolve faster than historical experience might suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">As a consequence, European policy-makers will have to recognise that this newly found global importance also brings with it new responsibilities and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The euro area and the new international financial architecture The euro is set to propel the euro area into a role of systemic importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The Eurosystem's role on the international scene will tend to expand and develop over time, as it gains experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">In the context of international co-operation, the Eurosystem and the ECB will also play an increasing role in providing technical assistance in their fields of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The Eurosystem is a strong advocate of a functioning world economy and considers the various fora for international co-operation as important instruments for managing the increasing trend towards globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The high degree of international capital mobility and technological advances have created interdependencies, which call for new forms of global "governance".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In this vein, we support efforts to improve the international financial system and to enhance the transparency of financial institutions as proposed, inter alia, by the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">We are also in favour of co-ordinating the work of banking supervisors as advocated by the BIS, and of striving for greater systemic stability with emerging countries as instituted by the G-20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Assuming this new responsibility for the stability of the international financial system as a whole, however, should not be misinterpreted as a move towards managing exchange rates between the world's three leading currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In our view, exchange rates are primarily the outcome of current and expected monetary, fiscal and structural policies as well as cyclical and other economic developments in the field of monetary stability and external current account balance, rather than an objective or target of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.81,0)">Having said that, the Eurosystem does not regard the exchange rate with "benign neglect".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The external value of the euro is an important policy indicator insofar as it has impact on the policy objectives of the Eurosystem and influences the euro area's role in the world economy.</span>
