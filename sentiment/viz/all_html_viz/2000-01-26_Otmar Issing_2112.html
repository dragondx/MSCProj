    <span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)"> The euro area - first experience and perspectives by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of The Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Conference "Germany - Structural Revolution",on 26 January 2000 in Berlin Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to speak here at the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter   conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Since the introduction of the euro, the MSDW Global Economics Team seems to have focused its attention on the analysis of the euro area developments, and has been a critical, but fair observer and commentator of the Eurosystem's monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The single currency offers a great opportunity to achieve the objective of sustained and widespread price stability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">For the euro to become a "success story" as the single currency for around 300 million people, the public confidence in the stability of the new currency and in the Eurosystem, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">the European Central Bank and the national central banks   of the 11 participating Member States, plays a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Eurosystem has already achieved a great deal of progress during the past thirteen months in building up its credibility and gaining a sound reputation in the financial markets for its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The introduction of the euro also carries a number of benefits, which should help the euro area achieve higher growth and lower unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">For countries participating, EMU has eliminated nominal exchange rate volatility and associated costs of exchanging different currencies within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This avoids a misallocation of resources, and hence fosters growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The single currency makes prices across the euro area directly comparable, which increases competitive pressures and hence efficiency and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Further benefits result from the reduction of risk premia built into real interest rates and from the elimination of premia resulting from less liquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This should stimulate investment, and again foster growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.49,0)">However, the euro is not and cannot be a cure for structural problems facing the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In particular, the introduction of the euro has not and will not by itself automatically increase the euro area economy's long-term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.49,0)">There has been extensive debate on the question of whether the economy of the United States has entered an era of a "New Economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Growth would be sustainably higher than in the past, inflation would not be a primary concern, while cyclical fluctuations would be much more limited than formerly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The cause for all of this would be more widespread penetration of information technology in an environment of flexible labour, product and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">However, while some argue that this is the case in the United States, for the euro area to become a "New Economy", particularly in the macroeconomic sense of high sustained non-inflationary and employment creating growth, is a goal rather than reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.95,0)">However, I do not want to sound pessimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Europe can become a dynamic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The degree to which the economic potential of the euro is realised, indeed depends first and foremost on stability-oriented policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The single monetary policy can provide a solid basis for economic growth and employment, but it needs to be accompanied by sound fiscal and appropriate labour market policies as well as by decisive and comprehensive efforts to eliminate structural rigidities in labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In my remarks today I should start by briefly summarising the first experience gained with the euro area in its first year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I shall then focus my attention on the perspectives and forthcoming challenges facing the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First experience gained with the euro area Let me describe the first experience gained with the euro area from the ECB's point of view, which is first and foremost the experience with the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This strategy provides financial markets and the public with our framework on the basis of which monetary policy decisions can be taken internally and explained externally in a consistent and predictable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In our view, the monetary policy strategy has passed its first tests successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">At the core of the strategy is a clear primary objective for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The definition for this objective contributes to stabilising market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The Eurosystem defines price stability as an year-on-year increase of below 2% in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The Eurosystem aims to maintain price stability in line with this definition over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Let me briefly outline how the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy helps the Governing Council of the ECB to fulfil its task of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The first pillar of that monetary policy strategy assigns a prominent role to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There is a broad consensus that inflation is actually a monetary phenomenon in the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Therefore, monetary developments provide important information for any monetary policy that is aimed at safeguarding price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To emphasise the prominent role assigned to money, the Governing Council announced a quantitative reference value for monetary growth in terms of the broad definition of M3 in October 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The decision for a reference value rather than a target for monetary growth was in particular been taken against the background of structural breaks potentially induced by the changeover to the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">On the other hand, the available empirical evidence showed that the relationship between area-wide demand for M3 and its macroeconomic determinants is quite stable and predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first reference value was set at a rate of 4½% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">At its meeting in early December last year, the Governing Council reviewed this reference value and concluded that the assumptions underlying its derivation remain valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">Thus, there was no reason to change the reference value of 4½% M3 growth per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Governing Council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis, with the next review to take place in December 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.72,0)">The reference value is a medium-term concept and differs from a yearly monetary target in several respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">First, it is not a reference value for a calendar year, but an expression of a medium-term development over several years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For this reason, the generous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind when assessing the information content of monetary developments in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Second, the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Rather, monetary developments are thoroughly analysed in respect of their causes and implications for future price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">The ECB does not focus solely on money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.91,0)">The problem with looking only at money is that, in the short run the relationship between money and prices can be distorted by portfolio shifts and institutional factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">Short-term developments in money therefore need to be analysed very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.21,0)">Against this background, the Governing Council has always communicated to the public that it cannot and will not react mechanically to deviations of actual monetary growth from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Also in this sense, the concept underlying the Eurosystem's strategy is different from monetary targeting in the traditional sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Monetary policy should always react to all the information available with a view to maintaining price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For this reason, the Eurosystem's strategy is based on two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This assessment encompasses a wide range of indicator variables, including macroeconomic projections produced both within and outside the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Within the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the exchange rate is an important variable for the Eurosystem as it is one of the determinants of the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">If exchange rate developments pose a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be taken into account together with the information on price developments revealed by all other indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.32,0)">The exchange rate on the other hand, in the context of the clear mandate and the appropriate strategy cannot be a target of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I am convinced that our strategy has worked very well and will continue to be appropriate for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The chosen strategy is forward-looking in nature and oriented to the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">It truly reflects the complexity of the economy, it allows to take into account the possibility of a regime shift at the start of Stage Three, and it is sufficiently flexible to allow for appropriate responses to specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy eschews mechanistic reactions to any single indicator, including monetary aggregates, exchange rate developments or inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">To put it briefly: After one year of experience I am even more convinced than before the start of EMU that we have found the proper answer to this historically unique challenge of a new currency and a new central bank for such a large economic area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The ECB has committed itself to be open, transparent and accountable for its decisions and its performance vis-à-vis the European public and the European Parliament, its elected representative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For this reason, the ECB provides the general public with detailed background information on its monetary policy and the Governing Council's decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For example, immediately after the first Governing Council meeting each month, the President and the Vice-President hold extended press conferences, with the President's introductory statement as well as the transcript of questions and answers being almost immediately released on the ECB's World Wide Web page.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This practice is similar to the publication of minutes, and has the advantage of presenting the Council's assessment of the economic situation almost instantaneously after the meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The ECB also publishes a Monthly Bulletin, which provides additional background information to explain in more detail its current assessment of monetary, financial and other economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In addition, speeches such as mine today and other public appearances of members of the Executive Board, for example at hearings of the European Parliament, are an important channel of communication with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.72,0)">And last but not least, once a year, the ECB releases an Annual Report on its activities to the European public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Perspectives and challenges facing the euro area Let me now try to look ahead towards the perspectives facing the euro area and the challenges that policymakers will have to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.29,0)">The reduction of unemployment is the major challenge currently, and for the foreseeable future, facing most euro area Member States, and the larger ones in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.53,0)">An estimated 12.6 million people in the euro area are looking for employment today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.35,0)">This represents almost 10% of the workforce and it does not even include those who may have given up looking for a job even though they are willing to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Fortunately, an economic recovery is now under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Real GDP growth increased during the second half of 1999 and leading indicators point towards a continuation of strong growth in the euro area during this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.29,0)">Forecasters both in private institutions such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as well as institutions like the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission have revised their forecasts upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Most forecasts expect that real GDP growth in the euro area will come close to 3% in 2000 and 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">That should also lead to a cyclical recovery of employment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The challenge for both monetary policy and economic policies at this juncture is to maintain non-inflationary growth in the euro area, that is to ensure that the current cyclical recovery is the beginning of a long period of growth without inflation, creating many jobs and hence effectively tackling the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Among central bankers and economists, overwhelming agreement exists that there is no long-run trade-off between real activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.43,0)">Attempts to use monetary policy to raise real economic activity above its sustainable level will over time simply lead to ever higher inflation, not faster economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The best contribution which monetary policy can make to sustainable growth and high employment in the euro area is to maintain price stability in a credible and lasting manner, allowing the considerable benefits of price stability to be reaped over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">A recent study published in the November issue of the ECB's Monthly Bulletin once again confirms that price stability is essential as a foundation for strengthening output and employment prospects and thereby creating lasting improvements in living standards for Europe's citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">There is convincing evidence presented by the experience of individual countries now forming the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.65,0)">Long-term real interest rates have fallen most substantially in those countries which entered the 1990s with relatively high inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">With the sustained reduction of inflation in the period preceding the transition to Stage Three of EMU in January 1999, it was in these countries that the benefit of moving towards an environment of price stability was greatest and, therefore, where the reduction in inflation risk premia was most substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In this way, these countries have lowered the effective cost of investment, which over the medium term should improve growth and employment prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">When price stability prevails over the medium-term, the relative price signals on which the market mechanisms rely are not obscured by changes in the general price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The market is therefore able to allocate scarce resources more efficiently to their most productive uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As can be seen since the mid-1990s, the credible establishment of price stability throughout the euro area has helped to reduce the uncertainty with regard to future price developments and has thereby reduced the inflation risk premium in long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">That improves the financing conditions for investment, helps avoid arbitrary redistribution of wealth and income, and thereby improves overall economic welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Through these and other channels, the current environment of stable prices is contributing to the growth and employment potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.02,0)">It should be absolutely clear that monetary policy alone cannot do the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The full benefits of the euro will only be reaped if there is appropriate support from other policies, especially fiscal and labour market policies, and if structural reforms are carried out in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In this regard, sound fiscal policies in the EU Member States are of utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">More specifically, Members States must continue to strive for policies aimed at the medium-term objective of budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus, as stipulated in the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Sound government finances are important to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for the strong and sustainable growth necessary to support employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.36,0)">At the same time, high burdens of taxes and social security contributions continue to restrict economic dynamism across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Governments are starting to address this issue in their budgetary planning and more progress would be desirable over the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.27,0)">The problem at this juncture is that a number of countries are still far from reaching the target of budget surpluses or even balanced budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.42,0)">Substantial structural imbalances continue to restrict the flexibility of public sector budgets to react to cyclical fluctuations and also limit the scope for tax cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">To be sure, the need for sustained fiscal consolidation seems to have been acknowledged across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.33,0)">The latest estimates of fiscal positions in euro area Member States show that the average general government deficit-to-GDP ratio in 1999 declined to 1½% and that most Member States' targets for their budgetary positions have been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.53,0)">Looking ahead, a further decline in deficits is anticipated as a consequence of the cyclical upswing and the further reduction in interest payments in relation to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.31,0)">Nevertheless, the average deficit for the euro area forecast for 2000 implies limited consolidation and only a small decline in debt ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Public finances need to be safeguarded against the burdens arising from excessively high debt ratios and the consequences of ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I should like to emphasize that the ECB is of course not concerned about higher real economic activity growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In fact, we do believe that the euro area has the potential for much stronger non-inflationary growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">What is needed to achieve high non-inflationary growth in the euro area is decisive efforts by all policy-makers in the euro area Member States towards fundamental and far-ranging structural reforms of the product, and in particular the labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.96,0)">There is little doubt that the root causes of unemployment in the euro area are structural rigidities in the labour market and tight regulation in product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.68,0)">It is obvious that structural problems require structural solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Implementation of structural reform aimed at reducing rigidities in product and labour markets is indeed urgently needed to prevent the emergence of real bottlenecks and ensuing price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">Indications of skilled labour shortages have already started to become apparent in some Member States, in spite of still high unemployment rates in some cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are many examples of what can be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.74,0)">First, there are measures to ensure that low-productivity workers are not forced out of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">To this end, the burden of taxes and non-wage labour costs could be reduced for low-paid workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.7,0)">In addition, minimum wage schemes need to take account of the need to preserve jobs for low-productivity workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, there are "active labour market measures" which provide programmes of education, training and work experience targeted at the long-term unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Third, reforms to the tax and benefit systems could be implemented which ensure that people are significantly better off in work than out of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">I should like to emphasise that the structural reform agenda available to national governments to promote economic development extends well beyond the reform of labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">For example, national governments can take steps to promote entrepreneurship and make it easier for people to start and run businesses and thus create new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This could involve encouraging competition through measures to promote the entry of new firms, such as reducing the administrative burdens they face and making markets more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Furthermore, governments can speed up the liberalisation of previously highly regulated sectors, in particular network industries such as telecommunications, energy, transport, water and postal services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">A good deal of liberalisation of these industries has been achieved across the euro area during the recent past, and the impact has been, and continues to be seen not least in the development of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.7,0)">However, there are still significant country and sector-specific differences in the timing and scope of market opening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Further advances in the liberalisation are clearly highly desirable as the price and quality of output of these industries is not only important for the competitiveness of the European industry, but also for the standard of living of European consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">National governments may also wish to take steps to raise productive investment in research and development to increase growth in expanding high-tech industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Social partners also have to play an important role within EMU in order to foster growth and improve employment prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Social partners remain principally responsible for reconciling high employment with appropriate wage settlements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Generally speaking, it is of utmost importance that wage cost developments in Member States are allowed to reflect different economic and employment situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.92,0)">The current situation with regard to employment and unemployment, differs indeed widely within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.86,0)">But whilst this is not by itself to be seen as a problem, it should be clear that a "one-size-fits-all"uniform wage policy could be fatal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.5,0)">Moreover, social partners should take into account the needs of both "insiders" and "outsiders"; wage settlements which only reflect the interests of the employed may set a too high wage level for the unemployed to find work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">For wage developments to contribute to an employment-friendly policy setting in the euro area, the social partners should pursue a course in line with the following desired characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">To start with, nominal wage increases in euro area Member States must be consistent with price stability; thereby in the euro area, aggregate wage increases will be consistent with keeping price increases within the price stability objective of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Secondly, real wage increases in relation to labour productivity growth should take into account the need to strengthen, where necessary, and subsequently maintain the profitability of employment-creating investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In principle, as a very broad guideline real wage increases in line with productivity gains would ensure no upward pressure on unit labour costs while not necessarily contributing to further employment and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Thirdly, in order to improve employability, wage agreements should take into account differentials in productivity levels according to qualifications, skills and geographical areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.45,0)">And finally, especially within the euro area, it will be of crucial importance to avoid a convergence of nominal and real wages across countries and regions out of line with productivity; therefore, wage imitation effects should be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.34,0)">Labour cost differences between Member States should continue to reflect discrepancies in labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, I am convinced that EMU provides a great opportunity to create and maintain a large zone of price stability and economic prosperity in Europe, including a substantial reduction of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The short-term outlook for the euro area appears to be favourable for an upswing in economic growth accompanied by price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">With the appropriate policies in place, the momentum of growth might eventually turn out to be stronger than currently expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Monetary policy will support a lasting path of growth by maintaining price stability and keeping inflation expectations low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Such a policy ensures the most favourable financing conditions as it limits risk premia in interest rates, and it allows social partners to conduct wage negotiations which focus on job creation rather than on how to protect the purchasing power of workers against inflationary losses in the wake of uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">While the ECB will play its role in this regard, governments and social partners also have important responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">In particular, further progress needs to be made in the consolidation of public finance, beyond the current cyclical improvements, and structural policies to improve the functioning of both labour and product markets need to be rigorously pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Policy-makers in all areas must therefore take the new environment of EMU, and its consequences, into account accordingly when formulating their policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">By setting and maintaining these conditions, policy-makers will maximise the chances for economic growth, and thereby contribute to fully exploit the growth potential of Europe.</span>
