    <span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)"> Towards a stability-oriented policy framework Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the conference “Reconstructing the world economy – Redesigning the macro-framework” organised by the Korea Development Institute and International Monetary Fund,Seoul, 25 February 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, In discussing the current macroeconomic framework, I will focus on the institutional aspects that have proved successful, in particular, from the European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These are central bank independence, the centrality of price stability for monetary policy and the need to adopt a medium-term, rules-based perspective in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.67,0)">The financial crisis has not contested or discredited these three principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">However, it is certainly true that other aspects of the international consensus framework merit some deep re-thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will take this opportunity to share my thoughts on four such elements, namely inflation targeting, central banking as risk management, monetary policy and asset prices, and fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The reference model Inflation targeting, together with the canonised version of the New Keynesian model on which it is predicated, is perhaps the main building block of the pre-crisis consensus paradigm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Although they are closely connected, I wish to separate the policy prescriptions from the underlying model, and address each in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.05,0)">The shortcomings of the New Keynesian modelling paradigm have been recognised before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">But addressing them has not yielded a paradigm shift to overcome them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.34,0)">The first shortcoming of this paradigm is its inability to explain and recognise the importance of financial frictions and the role of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.77,0)">Money is at best ignored – and at worst derided – as a redundant and unnecessary complication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.36,0)">This has to do with the fragile theoretical foundations of the mechanisms which – in this paradigm – account for the connection between the real economy, financial imbalances, and the state of confidence and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.15,0)">This disregarding of money goes hand-in-hand with the assumption of the absence of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The mainstream model excludes default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.1,0)">If assets are formulated at all, they all net out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">No risk generated in the financial sector can affect the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.17,0)">The financial crisis has clearly exposed the flaws in this assumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.23,0)">It has led to a misapprehension of the root causes of the crisis and its propagation mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Liquidity and money are key for the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.05,0)">Far from showing that the ECB’s strategy lacks theoretical foundations, the crisis has borne out our broad-based approach and exposed the incompleteness of the transmission mechanism in the reference model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.93,0)">The second shortcoming of this paradigm is its undue focus on small economic fluctuations around benign states of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.41,0)">This left economists unprepared in terms of being able to predict the crisis and its impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Third, the paradigm rests on the built-in assumption that the announcement of an inflation target automatically yields credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">The canonised version of the model does not allow for an understanding of how institutional strength and a track record affect credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Institutional strength requires central bank independence, for which, in turn, legal independence is a necessary, but by no means sufficient prerequisite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Inflation targeting The reference model has been at the heart of inflation targeting approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">In brief, inflation targeting can be summed up as follows: First, take inflation and output gap forecasts as summary statistics of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.03,0)">Second, ignore a host of variables, particularly money and credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Assume that these adjust to the state of the economy, but do not influence it independently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Third, fine-tune the policy instrument so that inflation forecasts – whatever the nature of the shocks that might have caused them – are stabilised, and output volatility is minimised, at a pre-set horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.81,0)">It has long been known that it is misleading to limit the information set to output gap and inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.63,0)">Output gaps are ill-defined and cannot be accurately measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.87,0)">Furthermore, inflation forecasts are not summary statistics of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.09,0)">Different underlying shocks – even though they might lead to the same inflation forecast – can have vastly different implications for policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Risk management It has frequently been argued that central banks should act as risk managers by organising their framework around events with a high deflationary impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">To minimise the likelihood of deflation, central banks should err on the lax side and aim at significantly higher inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">With this in mind, the IMF asks whether a permanent inflation target of 4% is appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The proposal is nothing less than asking whether in the pursuit of price stability central banks put macroeconomic stability at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">I do see the temptation for governments to ask for higher inflation in order to monetise the dramatic build-up of public debt in nearly all advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.32,0)">This is why calling on central banks to raise inflation rates permanently is most unhelpful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.17,0)">It deflects from the most pressing problem that, currently, macroeconomic stability is threatened by the unsustainable position of public finances in nearly all advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">I can only reject the idea of raising inflation rates permanently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.92,0)">I would not like to imagine the consequences if, on top of the current financial fragilities and in an environment of high public debt, the general public were to lose trust in the purchasing power of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">There is no evidence whatsoever to support that deviating from price stability and aiming at an inflation rate of 4% would enhance economic prosperity or growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.75,0)">On the contrary, no one would seriously deny that inflation has a detrimental impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.6,0)">The inflation tax does not constitute just another tax distortion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.17,0)">It greatly exacerbates distortions from existing taxes, contributing to a misallocation of resources and a rise in the tax burden, especially for lower-income households, and ultimately depresses economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It is an irrefutable empirical fact that inflation variability rises with the level of inflation, which in turn increases uncertainty for investors and long-term interest rates through a rise in the inflation risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.88,0)">A permanent increase in inflation curtails, rather than stimulates, long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.35,0)">A considerable body of empirical research finds that the Phillips curve has a negative bent in the long run: inflation and inflation volatility penalise capital formation and thus detract from the economy’s growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.25,0)">Empirical evidence confirms this negative relationship, with a 100 basis point permanent increase in inflation being associated with a 10-30 basis point decrease in trend output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Hence, if this is applied to the euro area, a 4% inflation target would shave no less than half a percentage point per year off trend growth!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.84,0)">As for using monetary policy to manage macroeconomic risk, it should be recognised that this would introduce harmful asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It avoids policy restriction when positive supply-side shocks reduce inflation, fuelling asset price booms; and when the asset price boom finally turns into a bust, it leads central banks to overreact to negative demand-side shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.78,0)">So, financial instability meets two formidable multipliers, the first being a pro-cyclical monetary response to expansionary disinflations in good times and the second being moral hazard in financial markets, namely the expectation that the central bank will aggressively protect the markets from “tail events” in bad times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">These expectations encourage markets to tend towards risky strategies, over-exposures and exuberance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary policy and asset prices It is worth mentioning the role of asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.66,0)">A long series of booms and busts over the past four decades have demonstrated that asset price developments can pose serious threats to macroeconomic and price stability, and that, therefore, central banks cannot simply neglect them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In this respect, it appears that a comprehensive monetary policy strategy, which also gives prominence to money and credit developments, might be better able to “lean against the wind” of financial exuberance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Central banks should be equipped with a broad-based analytical framework for monitoring and analysing in detail such developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">At the ECB, this approach is underpinned by the monetary analysis, the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Fiscal policy For many commentators, the financial crisis has underlined the need for a return of the State in managing macroeconomic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Of course, together with central bank liquidity support, discretionary government intervention has been key in forestalling a repeat of a 1930s-style depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.96,0)">However, we are observing a drift in public liabilities that will prove hard to correct with the usual stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.19,0)">In some countries, this drift actually has nothing to do with the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is rooted in the policy hyper-activism that was already in place before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And this despite the obvious dangers of an overreactive fiscal stance, which cannot be decided and implemented without long lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Here, fiscal rules, such as the Stability and Growth Pact in the European Union can help.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.88,0)">If given enough authority, rules can induce symmetric behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.01,0)">It remains to be seen how the discretionary fiscal measures adopted in response to the crisis can be wound down and reversed to support fiscal sustainability in the longer run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.55,0)">Since the ECB has started to gradually phase out its extraordinary liquidity support measures, fiscal authorities should also start to withdraw stimulus to safeguard public solvency over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">To support this, we have the right mechanisms in place in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Governments will have to comply with and, as experience shows, even re-enforce the fiscal rules enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Concluding remarks: some lessons From this quick overview, I draw two lessons for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The first lesson to be learned is that central banks need to broaden – not restrict – their overview of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Monetary data are critical in warning against risks that are slow to appear in inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.29,0)">Monetary analysis at the ECB consistently sent early signals that risk was broadly under-priced, when inflation was quiescent and measures of slack were moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The second lesson is that price stability is the only anchor which can pin down the economy in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is not sufficient to guarantee financial stability, but it is certainly necessary to prevent financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.14,0)">Increasing the level of inflation that central banks should aim at would be a step in the wrong direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Our price stability mandate has not constrained us from responding forcefully and successfully to the biggest disinflationary shock experienced in generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">With inflation rates in the euro area currently projected to be slightly above 1% in the short to medium term, deflation risks continue to be absent, and price stability has been maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.14,0)">Most importantly, of course, price stability has not compromised macroeconomic stability.</span>
