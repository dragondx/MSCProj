    <span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)"> Elements for intervention on accounting issues Speaking notes by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the colloquium “La juste valeur dans tous ses Etats” organised by Académie des Sciences et Techniques Comptables et Financières, Paris, 27 April 2010 Which are the issues related to the fair value for companies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Fair value is an appropriate measurement for certain financial instruments, notably those that are held for trading   and for which reliable market prices are readily available, as well as for derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, given that many derivative contracts have a zero cost at inception, fair value accounting is crucial as it recognises the potential leveraged exposure on the balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">Fair value accounting mainly raises two issues: first, when to apply fair value measurement   and second, how to apply fair value measurement  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.97,0)">First, in our view fair value accounting does not provide decision-useful information to investors if the intention of an entity is to hold the assets until maturity or to settle the liabilities at their nominal amount at maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.47,0)">In these cases, recognising interim fair value changes simply heightens the volatility of the financial accounts, without providing actual “information content”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.88,0)">This is typically the case for the loan book of commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.37,0)">Moreover, the ECB does not agree that an entity is required to record a gain when the fair value of its own debt falls due to a decrease in its creditworthiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The rationale being that the entity could buy back the debt and realise the profit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.06,0)">However, in reality and especially in times of distress, an entity does not have readily available the extra cash to buy back their debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.56,0)">The recognition of such misleading gains was particularly prevalent in the case of Lehman that used it to net against the mounting losses, which simply blurred the entity’s actual performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.19,0)">As referred to in the recent book “Too big to fail” by Andrew Sorkin: “ It means that the day before you go bankrupt is the most profitable day in the history of your company, because you’ll say all the debt was worthless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">You get to call it revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.61,0)">And literally   pay bonuses off this.” I think we can all agree that there is something fundamentally wrong with this argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.63,0)">Second, with regard to its application, fair value accounting poses certain operational challenges, namely when markets become illiquid and reliable market prices are no longer available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.5,0)">What is the use of marking-to-market when there is no market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The relevance and reliability of fair values based on market prices require a functioning market where prices adequately reflect the underlying fundamentals of the financial instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.35,0)">When the market is significantly disrupted, the use of market values may be utterly meaningless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">In these cases, appropriate valuation techniques coupled with adequate guidance on the application of these techniques are needed in order to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction would currently take place between market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">An entity should have in place adequate models that have been tested for accuracy in case the market is severely disrupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Moreover, in rare circumstances, if the market dynamics are such that an institution may be forced to change its respective business model  , then it should be able to reclassify financial instruments at amortised cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These are important lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Hence the ECB is of the opinion that fair value measurement should only be required if it is consistent with the institution’s business model and the characteristics of the particular underlying asset or liability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.63,0)">Which would be the worst drawbacks, if any, deriving from applying fair value in the light of the events happened in the last two years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Which are the positive aspects?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my view, the financial crisis has clearly highlighted the heightened pro-cyclicality stemming from two mutually reinforcing channels in the accounting framework: fair value accounting and the current loan loss provisioning practices   Fair value accounting – while certainly not being the “root cause” – served as an amplifier of stress in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.39,0)">Fair value measurement – by its nature – tends to introduce pro-cyclicality into the accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">It requires the immediate reflection of market-related information in the financial accounts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">In doing so, all fluctuations in fair value   are to be reflected, thereby increasing accounting volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.05,0)">Downward swings in fair valuations of assets cause entities to sell these assets; these “fire sales” may themselves add to further downward pressure on respective market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.92,0)">As a result, further adjustments to the fair values of these assets become necessary, thereby perpetuating the “downward dynamics”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.98,0)">These dynamics may in the end have adverse implications for the “real economy”, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.66,0)">banks may further curb their lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this context, the potential impact of fair value accounting on behaviour, asset price dynamics and subsequently on financial stability should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.75,0)">Pre-crisis provisioning practices delayed the recognition of credit losses inherent in loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.86,0)">Accounting rules require a specific trigger event, such as a default in payment to take place before allowing an entity to create provisions for credit losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.16,0)">As a result, major write-offs usually accumulate during severe downturns when the inherent credit losses actually materialise, adding further stress to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Hence, a more forward-looking provisioning methodology should be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This has also been a recommendation of the G20 Leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In this context, the ECB welcomes the recent IASB proposal for an expected cash flow approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Despite some operational challenges that need to be resolved before its final adoption, this approach allows for a timelier recognition of expected credit losses, thereby contributing to mitigating pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In this context, it should be noted that the Basel Committee has recently developed an approach which aims at reducing the complexity of the IASB’s approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The ECB urges the IASB to work together with the Basel Committee with a view to developing a workable solution to a more forward-looking provisioning approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This is also a good example of where the objectives of high quality accounting and safeguarding financial stability complement each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">On that note, let me finally underline that the ECB acknowledges the work of the IASB and welcomes the progress that has been achieved in the accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">We look forward to continuing the intense dialogue with the IASB on the remaining phases of the financial instruments’ project, as well as other accounting areas that may be of importance from a regulatory perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As regards the convergence between the American implementation and the IFRS rules, which is your general view?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">More precisely, on which technical/conceptual points Europe will not give up?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">One of the key lessons to be learnt from this crisis is the need for international accounting convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Towards this aim, G20 Leaders have urged accounting standard setters to develop a single set of high-quality accounting standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">A global set of accounting standards is desirable from the perspective of both investors and regulators since it improves the comparability and transparency on a global basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This contributes towards sounder investment decisions and thus to a more efficient allocation of resources as well as overall functioning of capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.38,0)">Moreover, the financial crisis clearly revealed the shortcomings of different accounting rules on both sides of the Atlantic, as differences in rules contributed towards a lower degree of confidence in financial reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For all these reasons, the ECB welcomes the ongoing efforts of the accounting standard setters to achieve fully compatible, high-quality accounting standards in a direct response to the G20 request.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.65,0)">However, we are concerned to hear that the FASB and the IASB are still far from reaching a consensus on key accounting concepts, such as the classification and measurement of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The IASB has confirmed a “mixed measurement model” that measures financial instruments both at amortised cost and fair value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In contrast, the US standard setter, the FASB, is determined to move towards a “full fair value model”, claiming that only fair value provides decision-useful information to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.58,0)">I have already mentioned in my intervention how the financial crisis has blatantly revealed the flaws with this measurement and how in certain circumstances, namely when markets are dislocated, applying full fair value accounting to the financial statements of the banking sector raises financial stability concerns and does not provide decision-useful information to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.09,0)">Just to re-emphasise, the ECB strongly opposes a full fair value approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In this context, convergence should not come at the expense of high-quality accounting standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Finally, with regard to recent assertions made by the IASB and FASB that convergence is on track, I would like to highlight that we are not so optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">In this regard, putting in place a reconciliation mechanism that simply discloses figures at amortised cost and fair value for each item on the balance sheet would certainly not achieve the aim of convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As regards governance, which improvements do you envisage in relation to the elaboration of accounting rules?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">First, I would like to stress that the ECB fully supports the concept of “independent accounting standard setting”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In their April 2009 DECLARATION ON STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, when identifying the main areas of concern in the accounting area, the Leaders of the G20 never challenged this concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Second, the ECB very much welcomes the recent efforts of the IASB with a view to enhancing their public accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We appreciate the open dialogue between the IASB and various stakeholders, including prudential supervisors, on various accounting issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Having said that, the ECB would still like to see accounting standard setters take better account of financial stability implications when revising existing or creating new accounting standards, as for instance indicated by the IASB on the occasion of setting up the “enhanced technical dialogue” with prudential supervisors in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">One concrete and important area where the IASB can prove that it takes duly into account financial stability implications would be the on-going discussions on introducing more forward-looking provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In this sense, the ECB looks forward to continuing the close dialogue with the IASB on the accounting projects that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">More generally, please indicate two essential measures for financial regulation in the current debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The ECB firmly believes that momentum should be maintained with regard to the global regulatory reform agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">We need to ensure we put in place a regulatory framework that will enhance the resilience and stability of the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Under the aegis of the G20, the international community has agreed on a comprehensive set of measures that reflect a substantive revamp of the regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Going forward, I would mention three key priority areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">First, the global community should commit to implementing the so-called Basel III proposals on capital and liquidity issued in December of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The ECB supports these proposals which are designed to put banks in the position to better withstand the effects of future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At the same time, it is crucial to carefully assess the macro-economic impact of the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">In this context, the outcome of the quantitative impact assessment that is currently being conducted needs to be awaited before taking any final decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.78,0)">Inappropriate calibration of the measures may impact on the provision of credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is particularly relevant for the EU financial system which is more bank-dependent and where the substitutability between market finance and bank finance is more limited when compared to, for example, the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The main challenge consists in ensuring a more resilient and stable financial system that neither compromises economic recovery nor unduly impinges on financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second, we need to ensure that we effectively capture all systemically important financial institutions, products, markets and infrastructures within the scope of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">One of the lessons from the crisis was the need to make the shadow banking sector more transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This becomes more urgent as we tighten the regulatory net for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.83,0)">Otherwise we may simply shift risks to unregulated or more loosely regulated entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In this respect let me mention the OTC derivative markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">These markets should be subject to greater transparency by promoting the reporting of non-centralised trades to trade repositories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Additionally, we should promote the clearing of eligible OTC derivatives transactions through central counterparties, which should be themselves subject to high prudential and operational standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Finally, we need to effectively address the risks posed by systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In particular, we need to define a regulatory framework addressing the risks posed by large and complex financial institutions, and to discuss possible measures aimed to ensure a smooth winding-up of ailing systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">It is crucial that a consistent framework is agreed at international level to avoid conflicting national regimes applied to multinational institutions and regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In this context, I strongly support the current work being carried out by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It should be mentioned that the same dynamics may apply in a boom, albeit in the opposite direction, resulting in increasingly “optimistic valuations” and thereby fuelling additional lending.</span>
