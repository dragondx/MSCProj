    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.71,0)"> Are different price developments in the euro area a cause for concern?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Central Bank, at the Financial Services Industry Association, Dublin, 6 September 2000 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to speak here in Dublin on the occasion of the annual dinner of the Financial Services Industry Association  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Public support for the euro in Ireland has been particularly strong, and this may be due to the prevailing expectation, stronger than elsewhere, of economic benefits resulting from the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.46,0)">The introduction of the euro, however, also poses some new questions and challenges for the ECB and national economic policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Today I should like to take the opportunity to elaborate on one particular issue, that is the challenge posed by different inflation rates across countries or regions within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There is a general consensus that the euro area economies have experienced a great deal of convergence both in terms of economic growth and inflation during the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In fact, the move to a single currency and the introduction of the euro are based on a successful convergence process towards a high degree of price stability in participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.21,0)">However, this does not mean that countries have always had the same rates of inflation during the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And, indeed, there is no reason to believe that they will - at all times - have the same rates of inflation within Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.1,0)">I am well aware that divergences in inflation have increased lately in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.62,0)">For example, inflation in Ireland deviates significantly from area-wide inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Different price developments will not generally disappear There are a number of reasons why differences in economic conditions have occurred in the past, and there is ample reason to expect that some degree of economic divergence will continue to emerge within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, there may be reasons why some differences in inflation may occur over relatively short periods of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">Second, national or even regional rates of inflation may also differ within a single currency area over longer periods of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me elaborate on each of these factors in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.38,0)">Short-term differences in inflation may generally occur due to country-specific, statistical and "erratic" factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">First, government policies may lead to different price developments via tax changes, liberalisation measures and administrative price changes, as they are generally not of the same magnitude and timing across all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The deregulation of national electricity and gas markets or measures such as the eco tax in Germany or the tobacco excise duty in Ireland may serve as examples of such policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.23,0)">Secondly, since patterns of consumption are not the same in all participating countries, the weights used in the construction of the national components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.24,0)">For example, processed food constitutes around 13.5% of the HICP in the euro area as a whole, but 21% of the HICP in Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This could, purely mechanically, generate measured inflation differentials across countries even if price changes for individual goods were equal in all these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.25,0)">Finally, different weather conditions or different numbers and timing of national holidays can create "noise" in measured inflation rates, which would be of only limited economic significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Looking ahead, there is no reason to expect that such factors would disappear within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.88,0)">In addition, a number of deeper economic factors may also contribute to short-term divergences of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">Trade patterns, production structures, tax systems, financial markets, and institutional structures differ significantly across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Hence, common shocks may affect countries in a diverse way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.49,0)">The 1998/1999 emerging market crisis, the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, and the recent surge in oil prices may all serve as examples of common shocks which have contributed to diverging developments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.05,0)">Furthermore, second-round effects of common shocks may differ because of different institutional structures, such as the wage-bargaining system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">Of course, the transmission of single monetary policy reactions to such shocks may also still differ because of financial structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.45,0)">Likewise, differences in inflation may occur on account of the impact of asymmetric shocks, or differences in the response to such shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.39,0)">German unification was a clear example of such an asymmetric shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Looking ahead, some of these deeper economic factors may become less important as differences in trade patterns, tax systems, financial markets and institutional structures are likely to diminish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Others may become more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In the face of increased openness and trade integration, a tendency towards country-specific and regional specialisation might emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.73,0)">This could lead to some inflation divergences between countries when shocks occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">However, to the extent that the linkages between industries increase across national boundaries as part of the process of growing integration in the euro area, the degree of synchronisation across national short-term economic developments may well increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.0,0)">Let me now turn to the factors which could lead to long-term differences in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I should like first to address briefly the issue of price level convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Price level convergence could be expected to take place in the euro area for at least two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">First, the completion of the internal market and increased cross-border price transparency contribute to eroding the scope for the existence of substantial price differentials for products which are easily tradable across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.32,0)">To a large extent, this may have taken place already before the start of Economic and Monetary Union  , but differences remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">One example of such a price convergence that has attracted public attention relates to car prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Secondly, with regard to goods and services which are less easily tradable across national borders  , the long-term convergence of productivity and living standards across the euro area would create a tendency towards price level convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Countries with higher levels of economic development tend to have higher price levels for non-traded goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">While higher wages in the traded goods sector largely reflect higher levels of productivity, spillovers of wage increases to the non-traded goods and services sector often imply that wage levels in the economy as a whole will typically be higher in more developed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">As the scope for increasing productivity growth is usually more limited in the non-traded goods sector, a general increase in wages as a result of productivity gains in the traded goods sector will raise the cost of producing non-traded goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This leads to higher relative price increases for non-traded goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In a dynamic context, as a less developed country is catching up with its neighbours, inflation in its non-traded goods sector could be rising more rapidly than in other countries, and as a result, inflation will be higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This type of convergence normally takes place gradually and within certain limits among relatively homogeneous industrial countries, but could, of course, reach a much larger scale if differences in price levels among participating countries are more marked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.17,0)">Are divergent price developments a cause for concern?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.2,0)">Are differences in inflation among euro area countries a cause for concern?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.38,0)">The short answer is, "it depends".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">On the one hand, as I have just explained, differences in inflation rates among euro area countries had to be expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They are in effect partly the result of the completion of the internal market and the creation of the single currency itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">On the other hand, if differences in inflation rates are quite large, they need a thorough examination of the underlying reasons as well as appropriate economic policy action at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The single monetary policy and the establishment of a more stable price environment in the euro area as a whole have been accompanied by a considerable degree of narrowing in inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">However, current inflation differentials for some euro area countries are quite large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">An analysis of data for price developments in various US cities in the past suggests that inflation differences may occur within a monetary union, which can be at least as great as those currently prevailing between most euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A further feature of the US data is that the observed divergences in inflation rates among these cities, although persistent, are not permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.15,0)">There seems to be a tendency for price levels in individual cities to return to their initial levels relative to the national average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It can be assumed that similar adjustment processes would generally also operate in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.04,0)">The cyclical component of consumer price developments may be affected by the orientation of monetary policy and changes therein, and could thereby exhibit more common patterns in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.93,0)">Typically, all kinds of specific shocks, such as oil price changes, seasonal patterns and weather conditions may then dominate the dispersion of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">To give you an example, the difference between the highest and the lowest annual national HICP inflation rate increased to 3.8 percentage points in July 2000, from an average of less than 2 percentage points recorded during 1998 and 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.92,0)">The biggest differentials have emerged in product groups such as food and energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.94,0)">These have traditionally been most exposed to such oil price shocks and weather conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.65,0)">Non-energy industrial goods not only show the lowest, but also the least volatile differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.97,0)">I have so far mentioned a number of reasons why divergences in price developments as such need not be particularly worrisome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.42,0)">There are, however, also circumstances under which inflation differentials are a cause for concern within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Let us consider the case of a country where domestic demand has long been growing strongly, pushing real GDP at or above its potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.69,0)">A further stimulus to domestic demand may then tend to generate upward pressure on domestic costs and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It will also lead to a higher demand for import goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.61,0)">The external position deteriorates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The increase in inflationary pressures in such a case is not offset by a rise in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.86,0)">Therefore the rise in prices relative to the external sector implies a loss of competitiveness for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">This in itself could exacerbate external disequilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.15,0)">Moreover, if the losses in competitiveness are not corrected, domestic and foreign markets for some products may be permanently lost, damaging longer-term growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.18,0)">Within a monetary union, the potential correction mechanism through the exchange rate is no longer available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Hence, the adjustment has to occur through domestic costs and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.59,0)">If rigidities in product, labour and capital markets hamper such adjustment, the correction may only take place in the form of weaker growth and a loss in employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.23,0)">The role of the single monetary policy and national economic policies Differences in price, and more generally, economic developments between euro area countries do not automatically warrant concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Some differences in economic developments across euro area countries may even be seen as an advantage as they would average out and help to smooth cyclical developments at the area-wide level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Perfectly synchronous movements would increase the amplitude of cyclical movements in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">However, a national policy response would be clearly warranted to deal with sizeable, growing and unsustainable divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The single monetary policy can only be geared towards the objective of price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.87,0)">It is therefore not in a position to influence the dispersion of inflation rates across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">If action is required, it must be taken through national economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">They need to ensure the capability of individual economies to absorb and respond to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The flexibility of national economic policies to deal with country-specific issues is required in all Member States of a currency union, but perhaps in particular in the smaller countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Because of sheer size and weight, economic developments in the large Member States have less potential to deviate from area-wide averages than those in a small country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.54,0)">Moreover, national developments in large Member States may have greater spillover effects on other, smaller Member States' developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.69,0)">Furthermore, small economies, such as Ireland, tend to have a higher degree of national openness, which implies that specific responses to divergent economic developments may be less effective and thus should be further-reaching than in the larger economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">As regards structural policy, it is important to implement reforms in the product, labour and capital markets, which are aimed at increasing overall economic flexibility and which would increase the degree of flexibility of national economic policies in reacting to country-specific events and common shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is important for all countries, independent of their cyclical position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Policies that support greater wage flexibility, wage dispersion in line with labour productivity, and greater mobility of labour across sectors and regions are likely to smooth the adjustment process, both in a booming economy and during a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Also, measures to increase competition in the non-traded sector, particularly services, would help to smooth the adjustment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">All such policies are desirable in their own right, irrespective of membership of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.49,0)">However, the use of structural reforms to address excessive aggregate demand growth in the short term suffers from the substantial amount of time needed to prepare and implement such reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">This should make it clear that national governments have no time to lose in taking measures to increase the flexibility of their national product, labour and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The current favourable economic environment provides an excellent opportunity to undertake the necessary structural reforms in euro area countries with vigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is also necessary for fiscal policy to play its part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.69,0)">In general, unbalanced fiscal policies have a negative effect on economic efficiency and on price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">They also increase strains on the single monetary policy, and may have negative spillover effects on other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact helps to guarantee sound public finances over the long term, which is an important contribution to macroeconomic stability and is also conducive to sustained economic growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.8,0)">If the public debt is reduced to a sustainable level and fiscal deficits are close to balance or in surplus, this creates room for manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers play their role in the event of the economy slowing down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">However, in addition, particular attention also needs to be given to fiscal policy in an environment of strong growth, budget surpluses and decreasing debt ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In such circumstances, fiscal policy should by all means refrain from giving a pro-cyclical impulse to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Concluding remarks To summarise, the euro area has experienced a considerable degree of convergence in inflation rates during the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">National differences in output growth or inflation observed at the current juncture do not in general appear to be unusual either from a historical perspective or compared with developments in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The more pronounced divergences in some countries strengthen the case for policy action at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Looking ahead, there is reason to believe that divergent price developments may continue to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.62,0)">Some sources of divergence may become less significant, while others may become more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB will continue to monitor divergent developments, but as our monetary policy can only be geared towards maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole, it cannot play a role in tackling growth and inflation differentials between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.26,0)">Therefore, national economic policies need to take action if divergences threaten to cause undue imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In this context, structural policy, strongly backed by fiscal policy, which is not pro-cyclical and in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as appropriate wage developments taking account of labour productivity growth and the level of unemployment, have to play a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Fortunately, professional forecasters not only expect continued and strong output growth to prevail in the euro area over the next few years, but the outlook also suggests increasing convergence both in terms of economic growth and consumer price inflation within the euro area.</span>
