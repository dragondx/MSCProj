    <h2> Welcome address by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world” </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Fabio Panetta </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(134.36709645000002,255,0)">     Monetary autonomy in a globalised world   Welcome address by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world” Frankfurt am Main, 26 April 2021 Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak at this conference on spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.43572629999997,0)">Over the last decade, globalisation has called into question central banks’ ability to achieve domestic objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.4679204,0)">According to some, close economic and financial ties across borders make inflation more of a global phenomenon than a domestic one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.274113800000006,0)">And spillovers would leave central banks less able to control domestic financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.2405008,255,0)">Today, these views are being put to the test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20.4689928,255,0)">US authorities are engaging in unprecedented fiscal and monetary expansion, which will show whether forceful policy stimulus can still raise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.677456350000007,0)">The associated improvement in the US and global economic outlook has generated upward pressures on sovereign bond yields, which central banks whose economies are less advanced in the recovery are striving to resist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226.439439,255,0)">Whether they succeed will reveal the scope of monetary autonomy in a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.64566820000002,0)">What will the outcome be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.0346567,0)">For smaller and emerging market economies, the constraints on policy may remain significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109.31319090000001,255,0)">But I expect this episode to confirm that globalisation cannot constrain monetary policy in large economies, like the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87707145000002,0)">How globalisation affects both inflation and financing conditions in the euro area depends on our policy response to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.5152929,0)">If globalisation leads to below-target inflation, it is because we are tolerating that undershooting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247.80114344999998,255,0)">The euro area has monetary autonomy – the only question is how to use it wisely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161.09607150000002,255,0)">Faced with uncertainty about the true economic damage caused by the pandemic, we must preserve accommodative financing conditions well into the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22.427438700000007,255,0)">Better still, monetary and fiscal policies should work together to deliver a stronger and more inclusive recovery, reducing the risk of inflation undershooting our aim for a prolonged period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243.95578170000002,255,0)">This is the best way to avoid lasting scars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249.60473295,255,0)">Globalisation and inflation Let me start by discussing the role of globalisation in inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252.48183164999998,255,0)">Inflation has a common global component, which is largely driven by energy and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.2874789,0)">But the view that globalisation makes inflation a global phenomenon – and a disinflationary one – goes further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.411851800000012,0)">Trade integration might cause disinflation through lower import prices, lower production costs and the forced exit of less productive domestic producers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.70175099999997,0)">By increasing global labour supply, it might have created “global slack”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.02832695000001,0)">And growing international competition could limit the scope for firms to pass on domestic cost increases to consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.55395975,0)">These forces, especially commodity price shocks, can have sizeable effects on price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.45518124999998,0)">But the evidence suggests that globalisation has only marginal effects on trend inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.74051800000001,0)">While inflation has fallen across advanced economies over recent decades, its correlation with the pace of globalisation is weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.846228,0)">The sharpest reductions took place in the early 1980s, before globalisation took off .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.264238700000014,0)">Since the 1990s, inflation has fallen fastest in two periods when trade integration was less intense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.1408473,0)">Similarly, global economic slack has little impact on domestic inflation or the slope of the Phillips curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192.49968615,255,0)">And there is little evidence that the role of global factors has increased for core inflation over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.8364768,0)">Consistent with this observation, euro area core inflation since the global financial crisis has been driven mainly by services , the inflation component that is most sensitive to the domestic output gap .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16.585141349999986,255,0)">From 1999 onwards, globalisation led to a stronger rise in trade openness in the euro area than in other large economies like the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133.5947346,255,0)">This, in turn, created more opportunities for euro area economies to “rotate” demand to foreign markets when internal demand stalled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143.11595010000002,255,0)">The result, especially in the wake of the global financial crisis, was a shift from domestic to external demand by the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.989479150000015,0)">This led to a large current account surplus , while the protracted weakness in internal demand weighed down on inflation .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110.09758365000002,255,0)">But after the crisis, lower domestic demand in “non-core” countries was not offset by higher domestic demand in core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.325093500000008,0)">Rather, domestic demand fell everywhere, which contributed to underlying inflation being compressed .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.396840300000012,0)">In fact, the United States entered the global financial crisis with underlying inflation having averaged 2.2% over the previous decade, and after 2012 it was 0.2 percentage points lower on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.691834149999984,0)">The euro area, meanwhile, entered the crisis with underlying inflation averaging 1.7% and, after the sovereign debt crisis, it was 0.6 percentage points lower on average .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.07475395,0)">First, globalisation could depress the natural rate of interest and make it harder for monetary policy to stoke price pressures, especially at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23.329496100000004,255,0)">That could happen if trade and financial integration increase global demand for safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.817744299999994,0)">Globalisation might also favour “winner-takes-all” markets that stifle productivity growth and put downward pressure on the natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.4884915,0)">But the evidence about the importance of global factors in explaining the decline of the natural rate is inconclusive at best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39.409946549999994,255,0)">There is a stronger consensus that demographics have been the key common driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.453845099999995,0)">Second, globalisation could constrain monetary autonomy by increasing exposure to financial spillovers, making it harder for central banks to set financing conditions at the appropriate level to stabilise domestic inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34.82521740000001,255,0)">Evidence suggests that a “global financial cycle” does exist, driven by international risk factors, and that financial spillovers from the United States to the euro area have been increasing since the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219.7476576,255,0)">In particular, since the mid-2000s euro area term premia have become more responsive to global factors .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.01466475,0)">This matters because central bank asset purchases that aim to lower market yields work mainly by compressing term premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.856279950000015,0)">If those premia are simultaneously rising on account of external spillovers, this could weaken the traction of monetary policy over euro area yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42204040000001,0)">Generalised impulse response functions ) allowing for correlated shocks are used to estimate the variance decomposition of the forecast error with a ten-day horizon, which in turn is used to compute spillover indices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37577215000002,0)">The latest observation is for 20 April 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241.51402155000002,255,0)">But in practice globalisation does not seem to impose an insurmountable constraint on the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18.240841050000014,255,0)">Even when economic conditions in the United States have diverged from those in the euro area, the decisive action we have taken at the ECB has allowed us to deliver financing conditions appropriate for our economic cycle, decoupling from those in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.30501854999999,0)">Indeed, when the ECB introduced forward guidance and asset purchases between 2013 and 2015, the correlation between US and euro area financing conditions weakened significantly .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.37880585000002,0)">And in recent months, euro area yields have decoupled from those in the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25.831155749999983,255,0)">This reflects the ECB’s commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions, which was behind our decision in March to significantly increase the pace of our asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.91980025,0)">and ECB staff calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.87790909999998,0)">X-axis displays end date of five-year rolling window.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.6655955,0)">Right panel: The cut-off date for the March Governing Council meeting was 9 March 2021.The latest observation is for 23 April 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216.31157595,255,0)">Asserting policy autonomy So we do have policy autonomy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39.23341005,255,0)">In the face of two key facts, we should use it to shelter the domestic recovery from adverse foreign spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222.95927805,255,0)">First, the recovery remains dependent on policy support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.58219945000002,0)">For example, job retention schemes are playing a major role in cushioning unemployment: the share of workers who are unemployed, discouraged or enrolled in such schemes is around double the headline unemployment rate .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203.0791797,255,0)">And €420 billion in guaranteed loans are still outstanding in the largest economies .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.1926133,0)">The number of job retention schemes is up to March 2021 as collected by ECB staff from national employment and social security agencies for the four largest euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.838696300000013,0)">Discouraged workers are approximated with those leaving the labour force in Q1 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.5463558,0)">In the right panel, the data on the take-up of guaranteed loans are for the period between April 2020 and March 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56056255,0)">In the absence of a breakdown by firm size for Italy, it is assumed that guaranteed loans to SMEs are those granted via the Fondo di Garanzia, while guaranteed loans to large firms are those granted via SACE .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.15939445,0)">The latest observation is for Q1 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.43183249999998,0)">This policy dependence masks the true underlying state of the economy – particularly in terms of labour market scarring and corporate vulnerabilities – and therefore its resilience to less expansionary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202.94160465,255,0)">The recovery will need to be well advanced before we can get a clear picture of the underlying damage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.874318650000005,0)">Second, even with the ongoing monetary and fiscal policy support, our recovery is expected to be slow and incomplete in terms of both growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.325708000000006,0)">In fact, the euro area economy is projected to return to its pre-crisis GDP level only in the middle of 2022 and to remain below its pre-crisis trend .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32.02982580000001,255,0)">GDP in the United States, in contrast, is projected to recover both its pre-crisis level this year and its trend thereafter .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115.84069620000001,255,0)">The euro area and Japan are the only major advanced economies where inflation is projected to remain subdued over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26.505844950000014,255,0)">For the ECB, this implies that we will have to maintain very favourable financing conditions well beyond the end of the pandemic period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.041540399999995,0)">The need for very accommodative policy over a longer period should in any case be uncontroversial, given that inflation remains well below our aim in our projection horizon and, according to survey measures of inflation expectations, even beyond it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31.09765545,255,0)">Towards more ambitious goals As I have made clear, Europe has the capacity to overcome the pandemic and its economic consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229.1662662,255,0)">So we face an important decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192.92392965,255,0)">We can act as a group of small, open economies, as we did after the global financial crisis, with each country competing to capture external demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89.61669,255,0)">Or we can behave how a large economy would, with European and national policymakers working together to raise internal demand through adequate policy stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.07682285000001,0)">At this point in time, failure to pursue the latter option – reconnecting to the pre-crisis growth path and restoring healthy inflation levels – would increase the danger of the pandemic causing lasting damage to our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232.31643929999998,255,0)">Three risks stand out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.8304692,0)">The first risk relates to the record high levels of public and private debt reached during the pandemic, which make debt dynamics more sensitive to inflation undershooting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28.714096499999997,255,0)">An accounting exercise indicates that if euro area inflation were to undershoot our baseline by 1 percentage point each year for five years, the private debt ratio would increase by around 7 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209.33389874999997,255,0)">This is equivalent to firms and households taking on €900 billion in extra debt at a time when debt needs to be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.497032250000007,0)">That could depress investment and consumption and further reduce inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26.977074749999982,255,0)">For governments, a similar exercise implies a 5 percentage point increase in the public debt ratio compared with the baseline over five years, and a 10 percentage point increase over ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128.49930165,255,0)">And for countries facing debt-to-GDP ratios of around 150%, ten years of inflation undershooting could increase their debt ratio by approximately 15 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.82233405000002,0)">This is the opposite of what we need at a time when interest rates are near the lower bound and fiscal policy is a transmission channel of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.46887300000001,0)">The second risk comes from the inequality that will likely result from the outsized impact of the pandemic on less advantaged groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.928448299999998,0)">These groups typically have a higher propensity to consume, so a fall in their share of labour income would hold back domestic demand and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.76019444999999,0)">Moreover, if they cannot reintegrate into the labour market we could see long-lasting effects, including a permanent loss of human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124.20847020000002,255,0)">The best way to achieve that reintegration and contain scarring is through faster growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17.83257585,255,0)">Getting back to our pre-crisis growth path would imply a 3% increase in GDP by 2022, which estimates suggest would create millions of new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46.87905719999999,255,0)">That, in turn, would lead more quickly to tightness in the labour market, supporting wage growth and the return of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142.63602479999997,255,0)">It would also boost the life chances of the poorest members of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.90390345,0)">For example, a 1 percentage point narrowing of the overall unemployment gap in the euro area reduces the unemployment rate of ‘low-skilled’ workers by 1.3 percentage points more than the unemployment rate of ‘high-skilled’ workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126.93526935,255,0)">Vibrant labour markets are the most effective way to support those who have lost the most from the pandemic and to reduce inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.602708750000017,0)">The third risk is that persistently weak economic activity can reduce productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.983974550000003,0)">Long periods of inactivity may hurt labour productivity through the loss of on-the-job knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.823598799999994,0)">And weaker sales expectations may lead to firms investing less in capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18.0956721,255,0)">With these risks in mind, it makes sense for the euro area to take advantage of the favourable financing conditions created by monetary policy to launch a stronger fiscal stimulus in order to rapidly return growth to its pre-pandemic path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228.5902365,255,0)">The focus must be on productive investment, so that spending is concentrated on projects with high multipliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97.58749784999999,255,0)">The additional investment required is well within our reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46.32792315,255,0)">According to simple, illustrative estimates, extra spending on productive investment of around 2.8% of GDP would be sufficient to reconnect with the pre-crisis growth trend by 2022 .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.5512841,0)">The inflation process is still a domestic phenomenon which forceful monetary policy can control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32.10597645000001,255,0)">The ECB has already asserted its monetary autonomy and will continue to use it to bring inflation back to our aim of 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23.438697299999994,255,0)">This, in turn, enables fiscal authorities to use the space available to them to bring about a full recovery, which would guarantee higher productivity, more sustainable debt and more inclusive growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79.0008819,255,0)">I would like to thank Jonathan Yiangou, Jean-Francois Jamet, Georgios
