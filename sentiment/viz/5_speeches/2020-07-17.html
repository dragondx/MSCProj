    <h1> Never waste a crisis: COVID-19, climate change and monetary policy </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a virtual roundtable on “Sustainable Crisis Responses in Europe” organised by the INSPIRE research network, 17 July 2020 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Isabel Schnabel </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(241.24484099999998,255,0)">    Frankfurt am Main, 17 July 2020  Never waste a crisis: COVID-19, climate change and monetary policy   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a virtual roundtable on “Sustainable Crisis Responses in Europe” organised by the INSPIRE research network, 17 July 2020 The coronavirus  pandemic constitutes an unprecedented shock across many dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.855339449999994,0)">The lockdown has led to the temporary closing-down of many production sites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.377438750000003,0)">Global air and road travel have come to a virtual standstill.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.5982873,0)">The effects have been so large and so disruptive that total carbon dioxide  emissions in 2020 will be about 4 to 7% lower than estimated before the crisis .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.6729761,0)">In the past 120 years, there has never been an event that had such a dramatic impact on global CO2 emissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254.28327660000002,255,0)">Figure 1  Global annual CO2 emissions     Sources: Le Quéré et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.67996015,255,0)">, Global Carbon Project, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre  and UNFCCC .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.98104059999999,0)">The range refers to the 4-7% estimated drop in emissions in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203.60223315000002,255,0)">Yet, studies show that even the substantial restrictions in production and mobility that were necessary to contain the spread of the virus would not be sufficient to limit the global temperature increase to the 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as aspired under the 2015 Paris Agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.98146559999999,0)">In order to meet that goal, according to the United Nations, global emissions would need to drop by 7.6% each year between 2020 and 2030.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.445179799999984,0)">Given the economic and social hardship associated with this year’s reduction, such a drop is hardly feasible by simply reducing economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223.46547345000002,255,0)">The pandemic is therefore a stark reminder that preventing climate change from inflicting permanent harm on the global economy requires a fundamental structural change to our economy, inducing systematic changes in the way energy is generated and consumed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.97682185000002,0)">With brutal clarity, the current crisis has exposed two major risks to the global economy: first, the far-reaching damages imposed on our society by a lack of prevention and early action, fostered by disbelief in science, in the face of a global shock that threatens not only the economy but our lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.05567674999999,0)">And, second, the repercussions of a failure to act collectively in a globalised world where inaction in one part of the globe can lead to highly disruptive and long-lasting spillover effects in other parts, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable in our societies most severely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217.0018023,255,0)">In this sense, the pandemic has been a warning shot with regard to the much greater challenge arising from climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.42148559999998,0)">In his famous speech, Mark Carney, then Governor of the Bank of England, has argued that “the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.168087750000005,0)">Moreover, studies have uncovered a significant lag in discerning the benefits of mitigation measures, which makes it much harder to impose costs on society today if measurable results are available much later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230.96062725,255,0)">By making the costs of a major, truly global crisis more tangible, the pandemic may help to remove the “tragedy” from Mark Carney’s horizon: after COVID-19, the dramatic consequences of a global climate crisis may be much easier to imagine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18.8603559,255,0)">And given the need for fundamental structural change after this crisis, the willingness to use this chance to take precautions against the even bigger risk of a climate crisis may have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193.2903621,255,0)">In order to achieve the European Union’s target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, our response to the growing risks of climate change has to start with the way we rebuild our economies after the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40.225393199999985,255,0)">In my remarks this morning, I will argue that three complementary pillars are needed to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon economy: an effective carbon price, a strong investment programme and a greener financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133.60040835,255,0)">I will also argue that central banks have a role to play in mitigating climate-related risks, even within their traditional mandates, because global warming poses severe risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232.3393281,255,0)">Carbon pricing as the central tool So let me start with the first pillar, the introduction of global carbon pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130.35715770000002,255,0)">Europe is already spearheading global efforts, which is essential at times when a global solution is not in sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227.94317145000002,255,0)">The EU’s emission trading system  is the world’s largest carbon market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89.77326255,255,0)">Its “cap and trade” scheme provides a mechanism for both reducing the total amount of emissions in a cost-efficient way and ensuring that pollution is priced adequately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20.883712049999996,255,0)">A recent study shows that the ETS saved more than one billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016, a 3.8% reduction in total EU-wide emissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165.45728039999997,255,0)">And only this week, carbon prices hit their highest level in more than a decade, despite the sharp contraction in aggregate demand and energy consumption, possibly reflecting the anticipation of tighter climate policies under the European Green Deal .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254.05196865000002,255,0)">Figure 2  EU ETS price     Source: Bloomberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.01843195,0)">Last observation: 15 July 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.60067435,0)">Updates only occur when there is activity in the market, so there may not be updates to every contract every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.19115829999998,255,0)">There is no reason for complacency, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.16545175000002,255,0)">Currently, the ETS only covers economic sectors that together account for less than half of total carbon emissions in the EU, whereas the remaining sectors are subject to a patchwork of non-harmonised measures across the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.06550380000002,0)">A global solution is out of reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.12910680000002,0)">Moreover, carbon pricing is not a sufficient condition to manage the transition towards a more sustainable economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213.1935507,255,0)">Fostering green investment and innovation This brings me to the second pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.675803,0)">In isolation, higher carbon prices could carry the risk of households facing higher prices, without being able to switch their consumption expenditures towards greener technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127.85986365,255,0)">Strong public and private investment efforts are therefore needed to prevent consumers from being locked into carbon-intensive technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235.92538035,255,0)">Public investments can serve a catalytic function in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.74264680000002,255,0)">Infrastructure investments, for example for charging electric vehicles, can trigger wide-ranging changes in the type of energy mix used in public and private transport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235.8318795,255,0)">The coronavirus crisis offers a must-seize opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241.16846595,255,0)">The costs of letting the current crisis go to waste would be exceptionally large, for two main reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.83419249999999,0)">First, business dynamism in Europe has been comparatively weak for a long time .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.080137950000001,0)">There are considerably lower shares of both growing and shrinking firms than in other advanced economies, holding back productivity growth as well as technology creation and diffusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175.40979525,255,0)">Put simply, new firms are more likely to adopt new and greener technologies, and we are not seeing enough of them in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.9409599,0)">Figure 3  New business creations      Data for

rgb(255,254.2352601,0)">Sources: INSEE , Destatis , Banca d'Italia , Census Bureau  and INE .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147.31796505,255,0)">COVID-19 is a unique opportunity to break this vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.2588047,255,0)">The crisis will require a massive reallocation of capital and labour across sectors and economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76.38365369999998,255,0)">It has the potential to unleash unprecedented forces of Schumpeterian creative destruction that can help accelerate the adoption and diffusion of green and sustainable technologies across large parts of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212.15075625,255,0)">Policymakers need to allow, facilitate and support this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.48149584999999,0)">But the scope for policy mistakes has increased measurably as the crisis has forced governments to expand their role in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39.39961139999998,255,0)">There can be no doubt that a forceful fiscal response to the crisis was both necessary and adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.395867049999996,0)">Nevertheless, there is a risk that some of the measures – if kept in place for too long – may delay the necessary structural adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.342370350000014,0)">Even before the pandemic, some carbon-intensive sectors had been facing strong secular headwinds in the wake of changing consumer preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.1207824,0)">The second reason is that the crisis will cause a significant increase in the public and private debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92.2607085,255,0)">Issuance of public and corporate bonds is reaching record levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104.27279714999999,255,0)">In a low-interest-rate environment, the increase in leverage carries a lower cost than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38.95417995000001,255,0)">But the best way to avoid the risk of growing debt becoming a long-lasting burden for society is to lift potential growth today and shift the economy on a higher and more sustainable growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193.85759430000002,255,0)">There are few other areas with a comparable growth potential as green technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223.67344125,255,0)">These are the reasons why the EU Innovation Fund and the EU recovery fund’s focus on the green transition are so important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23.900787899999987,255,0)">If flanked by national measures that improve the overall business environment, they will be major policy levers for transforming the European economy more fundamentally and overcoming short-termism in investment behaviour that ignores climate-related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202.14885045,255,0)">Greening financial markets The third pillar needed to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon economy relates to financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39.52151925000001,255,0)">The large increase in required bond issuance in response to the pandemic offers the opportunity to deepen the green financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24.02091584999999,255,0)">Green bond issuance has steadily increased in recent years, with a strong focus on the euro area and on public agencies and financial institutions .</span><span style="background-color:

is also reflected in prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.503317649999985,0)">There seems to be a negative relationship between the outstanding volume of green bonds and their spread over non-green peers .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242.68559865,255,0)">Figure 6  Green bond outstanding volume in % of size of direct curve peers  vs. premium     Source: Commerzbank Research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.91087764999997,0)">Hence, green bonds tend to be priced at a premium over conventional bonds, in part reflecting poorer liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20.73723240000002,255,0)">For example, the daily trading turnover of French conventional government bonds remains notably higher than that of their green counterparts .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.61555700000002,0)">Figure 7  Average daily bond turnover for selected French bonds    Source: Commerzbank Research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22.628475600000016,255,0)">The current crisis could give an unparalleled boost to the green financial market and thereby help reduce the costs of transitioning towards a low-carbon economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38.56561095000002,255,0)">We have already seen firms and governments employ more diverse and creative funding strategies in recent weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200.9535456,255,0)">Many euro area governments have started, or are planning, to issue green bonds for the first time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47.72879370000001,255,0)">This is undoubtedly good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.5502525,0)">But current market forces will not be sufficient to mobilise the funds required to finance the transition towards a more sustainable economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137.58776175000003,255,0)">Further policy actions are urgently needed, primarily on two fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251.98525995,255,0)">First, the costs of the crisis are mainly debt-financed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28.911953549999996,255,0)">But growing empirical evidence suggests that stock markets are more effective than bond markets in financing the greening of our economy, given the high capital intensity, high risks and long-term horizon of most projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50.4522243,255,0)">Europe therefore urgently needs to make faster progress towards creating a true capital markets union, with a strong focus on equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.62162975000001,0)">Euro area equity markets remain too shallow and risk-sharing across borders too limited to lift the economy onto a more sustainable growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235.0456839,255,0)">There is also a geopolitical dimension: financial market structures are gradually readjusting after the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48.16087334999999,255,0)">Green finance has the potential to tip the scale to one side or the other and act as a catalyst for promoting the provision of financial services more broadly throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166.7437095,255,0)">Second, faster progress is needed on disclosure and standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147.74463104999998,255,0)">For markets to better support the greening of the economy, and to mitigate risks to financial stability, asset prices need to correctly reflect the externalities associated with climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.909805599999983,0)">At the current juncture, however, financial markets are suffering from various market failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.6298956,0)">Uncertainty about what actually qualifies as green activity is one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204.01160505000001,255,0)">Common and clear definitions are a fundamental building block for facilitating the market pricing of environmental risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107.1543405,255,0)">The adoption in mid-June of the European Commission’s taxonomy regulation was an important step in establishing a classification system for sustainable economic activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.4782169,255,0)">But three words of caution are in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253.02574155,255,0)">First, the framework is expected to become fully operational only after the adoption of its delegated acts in 2021 and 2022 and so will provide limited guidance at a time when issuance needs are reaching historical levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93.63948839999999,255,0)">During this period, we need to find a way to mitigate the risks of “greenwashing” so as to channel funds to where they are most effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204.2331261,255,0)">Second, a green taxonomy needs to be complemented by a taxonomy for environmentally harmful activities so that investors can identify transition risks more easily and hence also price risk differentials more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.26345265,0)">And third, the taxonomy requires granular data for it to be useable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.38717745000002,0)">In the absence of corporate-level information, the taxonomy cannot be put into use and many metrics will prove useless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.21286310000001,0)">This is clearly visible when looking at environmental ratings for financial products: if available, they are often inconsistent, incomparable and at times unreliable – in many cases reflecting the absence of granular data or the large discretion in the construction of such indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.1006431,0)">Indicators from different sources often display a very low correlation .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244.2853947,255,0)">Figure 8  Financial market pricing of climate risk: correlations of bank environmental scores by Bloomberg and Refinitiv    Source: ECB Financial Stability Review, November 2019 based on Bloomberg, Refinitiv EIKON, S&P Global Market Intelligence and Dealogic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5586045,0)">The full unbalanced sample consists of 49 banks and 23 insurers in the EU and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173.076303,255,0)">Disclosure of climate-related information should therefore become mandatory and more standardised under the revised Non-Financial Reporting Directive, while ensuring proportionality to avoid imposing an excessive burden on small and medium-sized companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234.53361075,255,0)">A role for central banks in fighting climate change?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250.6042794,255,0)">What then, if any, is the role of central banks, and monetary policy in particular, in supporting the transition towards a low-carbon economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238.5245469,255,0)">The starting point for answering this question is the ECB’s primary objective: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.33235265,0)">Climate change, if not addressed swiftly, can be expected to affect the economy in a way that poses material risks to price stability in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.0242108,0)">On the one hand, the longer the risks of global warming are ignored and policy action delayed, the higher the risks of very large and persistent shocks to output and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.52452334999998,0)">So far, most central banks could afford to look through climate-related shocks, mainly because their most visible effects were largely local and temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188.10037515,255,0)">The coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the challenges central banks are facing in countering large and persistent global shocks, while remaining faithful to their primary mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210.42911865,255,0)">It is with this motivation that we are currently investigating how to integrate climate-related risks into our core macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.11030290000002,0)">On the other hand, the ability of central banks to react to such large shocks may be impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.277691350000012,0)">Rising temperatures and an increased frequency of natural disasters may further suppress potential output growth and hence the real equilibrium interest rate around which central banks have to calibrate their policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.089391900000015,0)">Years of subdued inflationary pressure and weak demand have already exhausted the conventional policy space across the industrialised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46.60233630000001,255,0)">And although central banks have successfully relaxed the constraints of the zero lower bound, the risks to financial stability and other side effects emerging from a protracted and intense usage of non-standard measures are likely to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.96065705,0)">For these reasons, central banks cannot just stand on the sidelines when it comes to climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181.5958275,255,0)">And the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that monetary and fiscal policies are most effective when they complement each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189.4958652,255,0)">This will also be true in the fight against climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215.28962520000002,255,0)">I see three major avenues through which the ECB, and central banks more generally, can contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207.84756495,255,0)">The first is through our involvement in defining rules and standards, and in promoting research for a better understanding of the implications of climate change for financial markets and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70.05747855,255,0)">The ECB is a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System  and has contributed actively to the development of the EU taxonomy of sustainable economic activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223.50434055,255,0)">These activities are at the same time instrumental for promoting capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160.861344,255,0)">The second way in which the ECB can contribute is by ensuring that we ourselves are an environmentally mindful and responsible investor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216.96594165000002,255,0)">We are doing this already for our pension fund investments and are now exploring options for other non-monetary policy portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.23939155,255,0)">The third, and most controversial, way in which we can contribute is by taking climate considerations into account when designing and implementing our monetary policy

of the overall universe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175.34534145,255,0)">As this market segment grows and develops, the Eurosystem will automatically purchase more green

the Eurosystem should go beyond current efforts and be more proactive and forceful in greening its asset purchases, or in adjusting the conditions of its refinancing operations, including the collateral framework, to take risks related to climate change into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245.99127330000002,255,0)">For example, we could link the eligibility of securities for our purchase programmes and as collateral in our refinancing operations to the disclosure regime of the issuing firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212.95837695,255,0)">Then

feature prominently in our monetary policy strategy review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.34042195,0)">Without pre-empting the discussion, there are two opposing views regarding the debate on greening asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.7616468,0)">One view is that central banks would overstep their mandate if they were to discriminate among investors on the basis of considerations that fall into the realm of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248.99895750000002,255,0)">According to this view, market neutrality is the benchmark central banks should use when purchasing bonds issued by corporates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93543400000001,0)">The other view is that central banks have to respond to market failures and incorporate the far-reaching risks that climate change poses to price stability when designing their policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238.09880145,255,0)">Importantly, this argument is not about weighing secondary objectives, which may provide additional justifications for monetary policy taking into account climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249.6050109,255,0)">It is about protecting the primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.23527525,0)">Of course, central banks would need to be mindful of their effects on market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.560044500000018,0)">Overweighting green assets in monetary policy portfolios could crowd out other investors, thereby doing more harm than good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31.882627049999993,255,0)">And while demand can create its own supply, success would ultimately hinge on green issuance growing substantially as the economy transitions towards its new equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253.41136784999998,255,0)">Conclusion Let me
