# NLP Project
Apologies on the bad formatting

GPT-3 code omitted

Note that dataset paths might not be fixed. Please configure that before running codes.

# Dataset
Raw Manually labelled topic dataset - FinTopicBank included
<br />
Processed GPT-3 augmented dataset - x2

<br />

Incomplete Financial Phrasebank - complete version on huggingface

# Topic Modeling
Note that we mixed the manually labelled data and gpt-labelled data for training.  This might not be desirable if you want to isolate/train only on gpt-labelled data and test on manually labelled data.  Reconfigurations is needed in the script in this case.

## GPT-3 Baseline

68.75% test set accuracy on the manually labelled data. We beat that after training on the data generated by GPT-3.


## Direct classification with BERT
Set the path to appropriate location (for accessing the dataset).

<br />

Raw dataset (eval mixed): 55.7% (give or take, don't use this)

Raw dataset (eval on manual data): 57.4%

Raw dataset (eval on gpt only): 57.9%

<br />

Augmented dataset (eval on mixed): 81.2%

Augmented dataset (eval on manual data): 81.9%

<br />

## SBERT

n = original dataset size

new dataset size = n*(n-1)/2 

<br />

We are dealing with sentence pairs.  Similarity score defined by the exponential of the negative Jensen-Shannon divergence. More pairs used the better.

<br />
Trained on 2 epochs.

Raw dataset (eval mixed): 80% (1.5M pairs) vs 77.5% (400k pairs)

Raw dataset (eval on manual data): 78.5% (1.5M pairs)

<br />

Add augmented data to get better results.

Note: don't train with sigmoid perturbed distribution. (worse)

# Sentiment analysis

This section is mostly just using existing works

## VADER

This is rule-based, so no training. We just supply a dictionary to it. (though effects are negligible). 62% accuracy on the Financial Phrasebank (test set).

## FinBERT

This is already trained for us.  86% accuracy on the Financial Phrasebank. (reported on the original paper, we don't know their train-test split)


## GPT-3

86% accuracy on the Financial Phrasebank (test set). This results is zero-shot learning. (i.e. it is as good as state of the art without fine-tuning)
